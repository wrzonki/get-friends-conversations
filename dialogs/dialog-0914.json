And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying\n      here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?\n      And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using\n      a breast pump..."},{"person":"Ross","txt":" Yeah, that'll do it."},{"person":"Joey","txt":" Wow! So, how are you?"},{"person":"Ross","txt":" I'm, I'm okay. "},{"person":"Joey","txt":" Really?"},{"person":"Ross","txt":" Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have\n      worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's\n      a divorce."},{"person":"Joey","txt":" Well, actually it..."},{"person":"Ross","txt":" No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel\n      and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing\n      other people."},{"person":"Joey","txt":" Wow, really?"},{"person":"Ross","txt":" Yeah, sure, why not?

And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know,\n      that's where things were headed."},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have\n      more children."},{"person":"Joey","txt":" Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have\n      kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name."},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's\n      out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other."},{"person":"Joey","txt":" Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck!\n      But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom."},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them\n      up with people?"},{"person":"Joey","txt":" I know; that just pushes them further and further apart. "},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" Yeah.

Now, if you'll\n      excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries."},{"person":"Rachel","txt":" I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight."},{"person":"Monica","txt":" Sure, we'll do that.

Have fun!"},{"person":"Chandler","txt":" (reading the newspaper): Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name."},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" Ooh, Joey. "},{"person":"Joey","txt":" Hey."},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight. "},{"person":"Joey","txt":" All right! Who is he?"},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold\n      down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me."},{"person":"Joey","txt":" (gives a thumbs up sign): Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got\n      for Ross."},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" Oh, yeah."},{"person":"Joey","txt":" She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!

"},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross\n      gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together."},{"person":"Joey","txt":" Ah, yes, The Plan!

Oh, you're\n      right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone."},{"person":"Chandler","txt":" Sorry."},{"person":"Monica","txt":" Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware\n      of at this age?"},{"person":"Chandler","txt":" Well, she's aware when we leave the room.

"},{"person":"Ross","txt":" Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be."},{"person":"Waiter","txt":" Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time.\n      Just sit and relax.

We have a bet on\n      how long it'll take before you give up and go home."},{"person":"Ross","txt":" What? You - you're making money off my misery?"},{"person":"Waiter","txt":" Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am."},{"person":"Ross","txt":" This is unbelievable.

Where's Emma?"},{"person":"Chandler","txt":" Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!"},{"person":"Monica","txt":" Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma.\n      You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell."},{"person":"Chandler","txt":" Okay. (Runs out.)"},{"person":"Monica","txt":" Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another,\n      we're giving a baby back to Rachel."},{"person":"Steve","txt":" (sobbing): I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you.
