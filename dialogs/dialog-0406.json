"},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some\npeople who just always try to get out of paying.

"},{"person":"Ross","txt":" Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead\nof a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of\ntime, and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands\nit to Joey who puts it on.) Here. "},{"person":"Joey","txt":" Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened? "},{"person":"Ross","txt":" What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there. "},{"person":"Joey","txt":" All right, so... next time, you take her to your place. "},{"person":"Ross","txt":" No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell. "},{"person":"Joey","txt":" What kind of smell? "},{"person":"Ross","txt":" I don't know. "},{"person":"Joey","txt":" All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?

Yeah, I found this great place called \"Invisible things\nfor Kathy.\" (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a\nhand with all this stuff? "},{"person":"Rachel","txt":" All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the\nclock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen. "},{"person":"Chandler","txt":" She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her\nto have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her. "},{"person":"Rachel","txt":" Aw, honey, that's so sweet. "},{"person":"Chandler","txt":" Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic? "},{"person":"Rachel","txt":" Oh! Pathetic!

It's an early edition of the "},{"person":"Joey","txt":" You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. (Joey leaves,\ncomes back in.) Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there? "},{"person":"Chandler","txt":" No, it came out to an even twenty. "},{"person":"Joey","txt":" Wow. That's almost as much as a "},{"person":"Mrs. Burkart","txt":" (singing) Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers,\ncreepers, where'd you get those eyes? "},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" You didn't get the money, did you? "},{"person":"Monica","txt":" Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's\njust go! "},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks\nshe is! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey, widow? "},{"person":"Mrs. Burkart","txt":" (Singing) Come on along and listen to... "},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" Okay, Widow! "},{"person":"Mrs. Burkart","txt":" (Singing) ...the lullabye of... "},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" Excuse me. Excuse me! (Mrs. Bukart stops singing) Thanks. Um, clearly this\nis a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to\nbe paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid\nevery penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place\nelse to go. "},{"person":"Mrs. Burkart","txt":" All right. I'll get my bag. "},{"person":"Phoebe","txt":" Good.

Make yourself comfortable. (Ross attempts to clear a\nplace for his coat and fold it small enough to fit. Then hit sits on the couch. Something\nfalls on him from above and he brushes his neck off frantically.) "},{"person":"Cheryl","txt":" (sneaking up behind Ross) Guess who? "},{"person":"Ross","txt":" Department of Sanitation? "},{"person":"Cheryl","txt":" It's me! "},{"person":"Ross","txt":" Oh! (She kisses him) Ah. (They kiss more, and move down onto the couch.\nRoss's hand moves under some garbage) Aw!
