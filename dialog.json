Finally Chandler was like \"forget abouther\" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was inlove with Rachel. She was like, \"Oh my god.\" So she went to the airport to meethim when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the planewith another woman. Uh-Oh!

{"0":"Rachel","1":"What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half herchicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?"},

{"0":"Joey","1":"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understandit, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, itseems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fearof heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be themost committed guy there ever was."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Amazingly, that makes sense."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"You think?"},

Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey thatI’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in myeyebrow and I like it’ (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretendfishhook.)

{"0":"Ross","1":"What trail?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) Thetrail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!(slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’ssister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’sfriends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"(reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linenstrips to leg number one,"},

{"0":"Monica","1":"Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Was it not pain-free?"},

{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’tseem to think it’s that bad."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being sostupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"(Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?"},

{"0":"Chloe","1":"I’m sorry, I do that."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?"},
{"0":"Chloe","1":"Oh no. I feel it isn’t really anybody’s business, y'know."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?"},
{"0":"Chloe","1":"Oh, well I tell Issac everything."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know wehaven’t actually met..."},
{"0":"Issac","1":"You dog!"},

{"0":"Ross","1":"Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her."},
{"0":"Issac","1":"Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love ‘em,monogamy is too cruel a rule."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?"},
{"0":"Issac","1":"Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We’rethe same, you and me."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Actually, no, we’re not."},

{"0":"Ross","1":"Right."},
{"0":"Issac","1":"But, we are."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister."},
{"0":"Issac","1":"I can promise not to tell her again."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(entering out of breath) Jasmine?"},
{"0":"Jasmine","1":"Uh-huh."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller."},
{"0":"Jasmine","1":"You did a bad thing!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Yes, I did."},
{"0":"Jasmine","1":"Very bad!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Very bad."},
{"0":"Jasmine","1":"Very, very bad."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebeyet?"},
{"0":"Jasmine","1":"No."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much,and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?"},
{"0":"Jasmine","1":"All right."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Thank you, thank you."},
{"0":"Jasmine","1":"But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and heknows Phoebe too."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(angrily) Who’s your roommate?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything toRachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place."},
{"0":"Gunther","1":"I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to?"},

{"0":"Chandler","1":"Off?!!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will everexperience."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unlessyou’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men,that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey’s arm and puts astrip on it.)"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Oh, that’s mature."},

{"0":"Ross","1":"I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself,and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy,and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friendleave? (Ross can’t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? Shewas in there, when I was in there?!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meantnothing to me!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!"},

So either he’s great in bed, or she just likesto agree with him a lot.\"\n\"Monica","53":"Sweetie, with you it’s gonna be different.

This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, (Motions to afossilised dinosaur foot.) we have a large foot. (Sees Ross working in one of the displaycases.) Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. (Knocks on the glass) Everyone wave‘Hi’ to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard atwork. (Ross does the old \"Putting a cigarette in your ear and pulling it out of yourmouth trick.\") Okay, moving right along. Come on.\"\n\"Phoebe Sr","64":"It’s open! Come in!\"\n\"Phoebe","65":"Hi!\"\n\"Phoebe Sr","66":"Hi!\"\n\"Phoebe","67":"I’m sorry, I’m late.\"\n\"Phoebe Sr","68":"Oh, that’s okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.\"\n\"Phoebe","69":"Wow!

Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I justthought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person.Y’know…\"\n\"Phoebe","75":"Okay.\"\n\"Phoebe Sr","76":"I really don’t think it’s a very good idea, Phoebe.\"\n\"Phoebe","77":"Why not?\"\n\"Phoebe Sr","78":"Well, because you’d be giving up a baby, and I-I reallydon’t—I don’t know if there’s anything I can say that could make youunderstand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm, (Picks up a puppy in the box next to thecouch.)\"\n\"Phoebe","79":"Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don’t-don’t hurt thepuppy.\"\n\"Phoebe Sr","80":"No-no-no, the-the puppy’s yours.\"\n\"Phoebe","81":"Oh, I get a puppy!!\"\n\"Phoebe Sr","82":"Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.\"\n\"Phoebe","83":"Why?\"\n\"Phoebe Sr","84":"I realise I don’t have any right to start get all parenty on youand everything now, but umm, (Sees that Phoebe isn’t paying attention and is busymimicking the puppy.) uhh… Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy,it’s very important.\"\n\"Phoebe","85":"Okay.\"\n\"Phoebe Sr","86":"I mean, I know what I’m talking about. I gave up two babies, andI only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terribleit is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret everysingle day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, itwould be like a million times harder to give up a child. (Phoebe is playing with the puppyagain, and not listening) I really shouldn’t have given you the puppy first.\"\n\"Phoebe","87":"All right, I’m sorry.\"\n\"Joey","88":"Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I’m-I’m saving this for myfriend Ross.\"\n\"Tour Guide","89":"You mean Dr. Geller?\"\n\"Joey","90":"Doctor? Wow! I didn’t know he had a nickname.\"\n\"Tour Guide","91":"Oh, he won’t sit here.

See that scientist inthe classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, butnow…(Turns around) Peter! Hey, Peter! It’s me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared mypuddin’ which you man! I gave you my\"\n\"Joey","96":"I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you.

(Joey wonders why) Gift shop.\"\n\"Ross","99":"(entering) Hey, uh, I’m really, really sorry about what happened inthe cafeteria today.\"\n\"Joey","100":"It’s no big deal. Hey, y’know, you do what you gotta do. Right?\"\n\"Ross","101":"But hey, it’s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides\"\n\"Joey","102":"Whatever.\"\n\"Ross","103":"It’s like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Whereyou work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the otherchefs, right?\"\n\"Monica","104":"I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.\"\n\"Joey","105":"Look, Ross, really it’s-it’s no big deal. Y’know you wear awhite coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then sobe it. Y’know, hey I understand. Y’know? Hey, when I’m in a play andyou’re in the audience, I don’t talk to you, right? So it’s y’know,it’s uh, it’s cool. I’ll see you tomorrow.

Come on, let’s go to the street. Ooh, listen,don’t go onto the balcony until after I get back. (Leaves)\"\n\"Monica","113":"(to Chandler) So, did you do it?\"\n\"Chandler","114":"Yes, yes, we had the sex.\"\n\"Monica","115":"Uh-oh, it was bad?\"\n\"Chandler","116":"It was fine, y’know? But she didn’t agree with me asstrongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, \"I see you point, I’m allright with it.\"\n\"Monica","117":"Well, it was the first time. Y’know, there’s not always a lotof agreement the first time.\"\n\"Rachel","118":"Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that.\"\n\"Chandler","119":"Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with awoman, y’know, I know where everything goes, it’s always nice. But I need toknow what makes it go from nice to, \"My God!

You gotta keep them on their toes.\"\n\"Rachel","134":"Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)\"\n\"Monica","135":"All right.

Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’knowwhat I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people inblue blazers, and I ask myself, \"My God why?!\" Now, I say we shed these-thesecoats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.

{"0":"Ross","1":"(chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No,wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—(He catches something important in thezipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)"},

But then once I got to know him Isaw that he's really sweet and caring and\"\n\"Phoebe","809":"Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things.

Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet heranyway.\"\n\"Monica","1276":"Why?\"\n\"Joey","1277":"Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like ofhot girl parallel universe, or something.\"\n\"Monica","1278":"What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviouslylives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!\"\n\"Joey","1279":"No. No. No. She lives on the\"\n\"Monica","1280":"No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the lobby.

Umm, well, first I would like tostart by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.\"\n\"Mr. Zelner","1289":"Fair enough.\"\n\"Rachel","1290":"Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (Sheputs her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to puther hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a bigmistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage.When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity.And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizesthat she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know yougotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances inthe workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want tolitigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didn't want to sue him.  Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (countsthem off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, andnot litigious. Look Mr…\"\n\"Mr. Zelner","1291":"Zelner.\"\n\"Rachel","1292":"Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think,I think I would be really good at it.\"\n\"Mr. Zelner","1293":"Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.\"\n\"Rachel","1294":"(gasps) Oh! You are?\"\n\"Mr. Zelner","1295":"Um-hmm.\"\n\"Rachel","1296":"Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh, would it be completely inappropriateto give you a hug?\"\n\"Mr. Zelner","1297":"Yes!\"\n\"Rachel","1298":"Okay, well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand butmisses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean totouch that—I mean\"\n\"Phoebe","1299":"You tired Chandler?\"\n\"Monica","1300":"You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what Imean. You know what I mean?\"\n\"Chandler","1301":"Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.\"\n\"Gary","1302":"So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?\"\n\"Chandler","1303":"Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to thelining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100.

(Gets up and heads for thebathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)\"\n\"Monica","1312":"Hi Chandler.\"\n\"Chandler","1313":"Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?\"\n\"Monica","1314":"Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual.Haven't you?\"\n\"Chandler","1315":"No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this isgetting ridiculous!\"\n\"Monica","1316":"Come on, we\"\n\"Chandler","1317":"Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are yougetting so obsessed about this thing?!\"\n\"Monica","1318":"Because Phoebe and Gary are inthat-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!\"\n\"Chandler","1319":"(gasps) So?\"\n\"Monica","1320":"I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore.\"\n\"Chandler","1321":"Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?\"\n\"Monica","1322":"Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each otherall the time?\"\n\"Chandler","1323":"Yeah that was great.

I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this longbefore. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, Ithink that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah Ithink that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)\"\n\"Monica","1326":"That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, Ifeel the same way.\"\n\"Chandler","1327":"Yeah?\"\n\"Monica","1328":"Yeah. (They hug.)\"\n\"Chandler","1329":"Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about ourrelationship.\"\n\"Monica","1330":"Did not.\"\n\"Chandler","1331":"Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!\"\n\"Monica","1332":"Okay, I freaked out a little.\"\n\"Chandler","1333":"Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We haveswitched places!\"\n\"Rachel","1334":"(laughs) I cannot believe Ross is buying this!\"\n\"Monica","1335":"Thank God!

(Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!(Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to goBen! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a milliontimes and no one offered me an audition.\"\n\"Ross","1353":"I know, it's crazy!

What if I did?\"\n\"Phoebe","3866":"Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of herhead! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in lovewhen they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross, you’re ascientist.\"\n\"Ross","3867":"I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got inmy face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty. (Phoeberaises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel!

Witha mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we couldhave a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they lovedstaying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.\"\n\"Chandler","3877":"Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe itcould be a game room, y’know?

Interesting idea, umm, talkabout it, but no.\"\n\"Chandler","3881":"So, that’s it?\"\n\"Monica","3882":"I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. Thebeautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.\"\n\"Chandler","3883":"Which is why\"\n\"Monica","3884":"What do you have against the beautiful guest room?\"\n\"Chandler","3885":"I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room,especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!\"\n\"Monica","3886":"Are you mocking me?\"\n\"Chandler","3887":"No, I’m not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautifulguest room. (Exits.)\"\n\"Joey","3888":"Hey, what’s up?\"\n\"Chandler","3889":"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.\"\n\"Joey","3890":"But you’re still moving in together, right?

I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be aninteresting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? Someone I can learnfrom, someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different thanme; a guy who’s\"\n\"Rachel","3893":"Pheebs, I have to ask you…\"\n\"Phoebe","3894":"Shhhhhh!

Every place Ican afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; (Points to one andstarts to read it.) \"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly.\" It’sjust, there is nothing! The city’s full!\"\n\"Phoebe","3900":"Wait, no, look at this! (Points to one.)

So uh,you interested?\"\n\"Rachel","3906":"That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I loveWarren! Thank you!\"\n\"Ross","3907":"Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano thaterupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.(Rachel just looks at him.) Here’s Warren’s number.\"\n\"Rachel","3908":"Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thankyou!\"\n\"Ross","3909":"Okay, you go grab it!\"\n\"Phoebe","3910":"I saw it.\"\n\"Ross","3911":"I don’t know what you’re talking about.\"\n\"Phoebe","3912":"Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’tadmit. You love her again; you re-love her!\"\n\"Ross","3913":"Look, I do not re-love her.\"\n\"Phoebe","3914":"I can’t believe you won’t just admit it!

But I should tell you this, this exact same thinghappened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to herand he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! Andthat’s how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay,that’s a lie.\"\n\"Chandler","3931":"Hi.\"\n\"Monica","3932":"Hi.\"\n\"Chandler","3933":"Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have agame room.

Oh yes!\"\n\"Chandler","3937":"Ohh.\"\n\"Monica","3938":"Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think ofsomething to do with the room together.\"\n\"Chandler","3939":"That’s a great idea!

{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies."},

{"0":"Joey","1":"You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People arefriendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice aboutmy equity investments."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"What equity investments?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes hisforehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But Ifigured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start tothink that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got abucket and some soap I can borrow?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishingcompound."},

{"0":"Joey","1":"Yeah, but it’s my wax."},
{"0":"The Porsche Owner","1":"Listen, I-I-I don’t come to this city much so Idon’t know if you’re crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could Ihave my keys."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Sure. Here. (He hands them over.) I’ll uh, save your parking spot."},

{"0":"Chandler","1":"He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, lookat his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way overprotective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!"},

{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Oh, I can still do that."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"How are you still single?!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybeyou’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Good. What made you change your mind?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"I swallowed the sonic blaster gun."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"How did that happen?!!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And itturns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying tocough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Damnit! Y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watchingthe babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! (He does it again.)"},
{"0":"Judge","1":"Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out."},
{"0":"Judge","1":"So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the groundsthat Mr. Geller is mentally unstable."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Fine, I’m mentally unstable."},

{"0":"Ross","1":"Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Well, you would know."},

{"0":"Judge","1":"That won’t be necessary."},

{"0":"Judge","1":"Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think."},
{"0":"Judge","1":"Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for anannulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(stands up) That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did withyour funny, funny form!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"(stands up as well) What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated likebunnies nonsense!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"And what—(notices the stenographer is still typing)—What are youtyping that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’ttype that! What?! Stop typing!

{"0":"Rachel","1":"To get you to make out with him!!!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Ohhh."},

{"0":"Kim","1":"You didn’t cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone madeout with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true."},
{"0":"Kim","1":"That’s not true?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"No."},
{"0":"Kim","1":"Oh that’s interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used toaccess the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him."},
{"0":"Kim","1":"Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. Youare sadly mistaken."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. Idid not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. Idon’t even know how to use my keycard. (The elevator stops. Ralph steps on.)"},
{"0":"Kim","1":"Hi Ralph."},
{"0":"Ralph Lauren","1":": Hi Kim. (Dead silence until Ralph gets off the elevator.)"},

{"0":"Hillary","1":"And after that, what could I do except become a chef."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Mmm-Hmm."},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Mmm."},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"You know, you’re a really great listener. Most guys I go out with,they just talk and talk."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Mm-Hmm."},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"After a while it’s like, shut your mouth, you know?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(Chuckling) Hmm-Hmm."},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about youa little bit?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Mmm-Unmm."},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"Come on. I want to know."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Putting his hand up to block his mouth.) Okay. I, uh, am fromLong Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in myspare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in afrying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl withthe flowers."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you tomake a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Ohh, I love birds. (Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"What is the matter with you ?!?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"What?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"You’re arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) Yougot dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This isnot Joey!!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know,they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of afamous baby."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"You’re turning into a women."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God,I’m a women!!!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"But why didn’t you just tell her the truth."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuseKenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? Youknow. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did sheever think of that?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Just for a second."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but Iwouldn’t."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Ohh, sleep with Kenny."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"That wouldn’t help me."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Ohh, yes it would."},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"I’ve had a really good time tonight."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Mmm."},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(Giggling) Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Picking up a piece of bread and covering his mouth.)Me, neither. I’ve had a really good time too, you know. (Putting the bread down.)"},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"Are you going to eat that bread?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(Putting the bread up to his nose.) Ohh, I just like the smell. (Sniffingit.) Mmmm."},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"(Laughing) You make me laugh."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Hmm-Hmm."},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"Would you like to move over to the couch?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Mmm-Hmm. (Picking up their wine glasses.)"},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"Maybe I’ll just turn the lights down a little."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(Covering his mouth with the glass.) How about all the way."},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"Okay. (She goes to turn the lights off and Ross sits on the couch. She hassome black light posters on the wall.)"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(Looking at the posters.) Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster?(They sit down on the couch. Ross smiles and the black light fluoresces his teeth.) So,ahh, where were we?"},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"Are those your teeth??"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Ohh, you can see them, huh?"},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"Yes. They’re insanely white."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"I-I, did that for you."},
{"0":"Hillary","1":"What’s a matter with you?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Kim, hi."},
{"0":"Kim","1":"Hi Rachel. Ohh, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new RalphLauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You wereright. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore."},
{"0":"Kim","1":"Oh, really?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"(Faking crying.) Yeah, he dumped me. He said, \"Rachel, I can’t dothis. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this.I’m married and I’m sorry.\" And then I don’t know why but he said,\"and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog inthe Ralph Lauren machine.\""},
{"0":"Kim","1":"You expect me to believe..(Doors open, Ralph steps in.) Hi Ralph."},
{"0":"Ralph Lauren","1":": Hi Kim. (Dead silence again until he gets off.)"},
{"0":"Kim","1":"Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It’s likehe hates you. Then it is true."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad."},
{"0":"Kim","1":"Ohh honey come here. (Hugging Rachel.) Ohh it will be ok. We’ve all beenthere."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"You and Ralph?"},
{"0":"Kim","1":"Kenny the copyboy."},
{"0":"Janine","1":"Hey."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you."},
{"0":"Janine","1":"What’s the matter? Are you upset?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff inhere. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay?That’s just the way it has to be."},
{"0":"Janine","1":"Well, if that’s what you want. I’ll just put it all in my room."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Great…Great…and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, Ididn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know. (She starts to collect all thegirlie stuff up.) You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, ifyou want to."},
{"0":"Janine","1":"Okay."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"And, uhh, maybe the watering can there."},
{"0":"Janine","1":"Sure."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"And a couple of these little tiny boxes."},
{"0":"Janine","1":"Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(Smiling) Okay."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(on phone) Okay, great!  Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.) Soguess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?"},

{"0":"Chandler","1":"Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I movedin!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we livetogether, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking wewould eat around four."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(shocked at the news) Why can’t I tell them that we livetogether?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Because they don’t know we’re dating. (Again, trying toquickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink andthe stove to cook.)"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Why haven’t you told them?!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, justout of nowhere, I didn’t."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen aroundfour! I’ll see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the livingroom.)"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Why wouldn’t they be happy?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"What? What? Why?!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re reallysarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off yourclothes and throw them on the couch."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’tcare what they think. I’m sorry."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when theycome over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and thenwe’ll tell ‘em."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"You really think that’ll work?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(hugging Chandler) I don’t think you’ll ever get my parentsthat drunk!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! You’re parents like me,right?"},

{"0":"Ross","1":"(not paying attention) Yeah, they don’t like you."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(annoyed) Do you know why?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybeit’s cause you uh-"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(angry) Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?"},

{"0":"Ross","1":"For real?"},
{"0":"Janine","1":"No, but you should go to Chandler’s. Because none of us knows howto cook, we’ll probably just end up drinking all day."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Ye-ye, we go to yours!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s mysister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because itreally helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that."},

I made up a joke and sent itin to\"\n\"Phoebe","667":"I didn’t know\"\n\"Ross","668":"Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s notjust about the pictures.\"\n\"Monica","669":"That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us.\"\n\"Chandler","670":"That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.\"\n\"Ross","671":"What?\"\n\"Chandler","672":"I made that joke up.\"\n\"Ross","673":"Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did.\"\n\"Chandler","674":"Yes, I did.

(She runs over and sits down and checks out apicture). Yikes!\"\n\"Monica","709":"So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell astory?\"\n\"Rachel","710":"Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she haslost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where arethey, where are they?’\"\n\"Monica","711":"Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.\"\n\"Phoebe","712":"Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn,lift up your shirt, and bend over?\"\n\"Rachel and Monica","713":"Yeah.\"\n\"Rachel","714":"You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’soutdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come inhandy\"\n\"Monica","715":"Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date,who would it be?\"\n\"Rachel","716":"(thinks) I don’t know.\"\n\"Monica","717":"Me neither.\"\n\"Phoebe","718":"Rachel.\"\n\"Monica","719":"What?!\"\n\"Phoebe","720":"I don’t know. (Pause) Me neither.\"\n\"Joey","721":"You forget how many great songs Heart had.\"\n\"Chandler","722":"Yeah.\"\n\"Ross","723":"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.\"\n\"Chandler","724":"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.\"\n\"Joey","725":"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, butI’m not even sure I got it.\"\n\"Ross","726":"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.\"\n\"Chandler","727":"And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.\"\n\"Chandler","728":"(stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.\"\n\"Ross","729":"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is whyhe sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.\"\n\"Chandler","730":"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.\"\n\"Ross","731":"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll showthe sexy teller that I am a published writer.\"\n\"Chandler","732":"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.\"\n\"Ross","733":"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?\"\n\"Chandler","734":"Yeah!\"\n\"Ross","735":"Well, I’m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).\"\n\"Chandler","736":"Okay (he goes to sit down).\"\n\"Gunther","737":"(handing Joey the bill) Here you go.\"\n\"Joey","738":"Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m notworking, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.\"\n\"Gunther","739":"Well, if you want, you can work here.\"\n\"Joey","740":"Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on asoap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have towait on all my friends.\"\n\"Gunther","741":"Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel asmuch as you want.\"\n\"Joey","742":"What?!\"\n\"Gunther","743":"Flexible hours.\"\n\"Joey","744":"Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?\"\n\"Monica","745":"(visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it,but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.\"\n\"Monica","746":"It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.\"\n\"Chandler","747":"You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Rossdid? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know?And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.\"\n\"Monica","748":"That’s a good idea.\"\n\"Chandler","749":"Yeah!\"\n\"Monica","750":"Do you know what’s a bad idea?\"\n\"Chandler","751":"Picking Rachel.\"\n\"Monica","752":"That’s right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hearsomething?\"\n\"Chandler","753":"Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealingmy thoughts.\"\n\"Monica","754":"It’s coming from the living room.\"\n\"Joey","755":"(sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat backto bed.)\"\n\"Monica","756":"(entering) Hey, you guys.\"\n\"Phoebe and Rachel","757":"Hey.\"\n\"Rachel","758":"Monica, what are you doing?\"\n\"Phoebe","759":"I guess it was kinda funny.\"\n\"Phoebe","760":"Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel thanyou is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okaylet’s go to lunch!\"\n\"Monica","761":"That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay,prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!\"\n\"Phoebe","762":"No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re justnot as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’sall.\"\n\"Rachel","763":"(To Monica) Well, people are different.\"\n\"Phoebe","764":"Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want.Y’know, you can just walk all over her.\"\n\"Rachel","765":"What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover?I’m not a pushover.\"\n\"Phoebe","766":"Oh, okay, (laughing) you’re not a pushover.\"\n\"Rachel","767":"Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, youknow what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I thinkthat’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go tolunch. (She leaves)\"\n\"Rachel","768":"I cannot believe her.\"\n\"Monica","769":"I know. Where do you wanna go eat?\"\n\"Rachel","770":"Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.\"\n\"Monica","771":"I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.\"\n\"Rachel","772":"All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.\"\n\"Monica","773":"All right.\"\n\"Ross","774":"(showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check thisout.\"\n\"Gunther","775":"Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.\"\n\"Joey","776":"Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m headingup there.\"\n\"Ross","777":"Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.\"\n\"Joey","778":"Sure.

(He gives Monica a ‘what’s wrong withyou?’ look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)\"\n\"Rachel","786":"Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.\"\n\"Joey","787":"Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if they’re inon a secret together.)\"\n\"Gunther","788":"Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron.\"\n\"Joey","789":"Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put onaprons.\"\n\"Monica","790":"Joey, do you work here?\"\n\"Joey","791":"No.\"\n\"Customer","792":"Hey, waiter.\"\n\"Joey","793":"Yeah?\"\n\"Monica","794":"Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?\"\n\"Joey","795":"It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor andnow I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.\"\n\"Chandler","796":"So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.\"\n\"Joey","797":"I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guessI’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? Ijust feel kind of weird serving you guys.\"\n\"Rachel","798":"Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.\"\n\"Ross","799":"Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?\"\n\"Joey","800":"Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird.\"\n\"Ross","801":"Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.\"\n\"Joey","802":"See, now it’s weird again.\"\n\"Chandler","803":"I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to makea lot of money, and here’s your first tip: Don’t eat yellow snow. (He laughs,then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2:15,coffeehouse.\"\n\"Rachel","804":"Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can passon my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at thecoffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a longway. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.\"\n\"Joey","805":"Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, howabout clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.\"\n\"Ross","806":"Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?\"\n\"Joey","807":"Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since Imade you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin.\"\n\"Rachel","808":"Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.\"\n\"Phoebe","809":"Okay.\"\n\"Monica","810":"So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a littlebit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?\"\n\"Rachel","811":"Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.\"\n\"Monica","812":"Hah!\"\n\"Phoebe","813":"That true, I am flaky.\"\n\"Rachel","814":"So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?\"\n\"Phoebe","815":"Yeah, totally.\"\n\"Monica","816":"Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance.\"\n\"Rachel","817":"Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.\"\n\"Phoebe","818":"That’s great. Good for you guys.\"\n\"Monica","819":"I am not high maintenance!\"\n\"Rachel","820":"I am not a pushover!\"\n\"Phoebe","821":"Who said you were?\"\n\"Monica and Rachel","822":"You did!\"\n\"Phoebe","823":"Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.\"\n\"Joey","824":"Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.\"\n\"Gunther","825":"No, I’m leaving to get my hair dyed.\"\n\"Joey","826":"Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part.Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in thisbar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’\"\n\"Gunther","827":"That’s the whole part?\"\n\"Joey","828":"Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but …\"\n\"Gunther","829":"Okay, I’ll see you in an hour.\"\n\"Joey","830":"Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat istaken.’\"\n\"Patron","831":"Oh, excuse me.\"\n\"Joey","832":"No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?\"\n\"Patron","833":"I believed you were saving this seat for someone.\"\n\"Joey","834":"So, you’d hire me, right?\"\n\"Patron","835":"For what?\"\n\"Joey","836":"Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to beclosed for about an hour.\"\n\"Joey","837":"Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a veryimportant issue in this month’s\"\n\"Ross","838":"It’s my joke.\"\n\"Chandler","839":"It’s my joke.\"\n\"Ross and Chandler","840":"It’s my joke.\"\n\"Ross","841":"Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.\"\n\"Chandler","842":"Let’s have Monica decide.\"\n\"Ross","843":"Yeah!\"\n\"Chandler","844":"Yeah!\"\n\"Ross","845":"Hey Mon.\"\n\"Chandler","846":"Mon, get out here!\"\n\"Ross","847":"Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)\"\n\"Chandler","848":"Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.\"\n\"Monica","849":"Why do I have to decide?\"\n\"Chandler","850":"Because you’re the only one that can be fair.\"\n\"Ross","851":"Yeah.\"\n\"Monica","852":"I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.\"\n\"Ross","853":"Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the mostimportant thing in the world.\"\n\"Chandler","854":"(to Ross) Don’t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I’myour only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go.\"\n\"Ross","855":"We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decidewhich one of us is telling the truth—me.\"\n\"Monica","856":"Okay, Chandler, you go first.\"\n\"Chandler","857":"Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.\"\n\"Monica","858":"Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?\"\n\"Chandler","859":"Can I finish my story?!\"\n\"Ross","860":"See, I would never snap at you like that.\"\n\"Monica","861":"Continue.\"\n\"Chandler","862":"So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’sdoctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is howthe whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize hispoint.)\"\n\"Ross","863":"Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution?Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!\"\n\"Chandler","864":"I’m not arguing with that.\"\n\"Monica","865":"All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.\"\n\"Monica","866":"You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive towomen, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, youshould be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!Now let it go! The joke sucks!\"\n\"Ross","867":"It’s your joke.\"\n\"Chandler","868":"Is not.\"\n\"Monica","869":"Hi, Chandler. There you are.\"\n\"Chandler","870":"Hi, oh hi.\"\n\"Monica","871":"Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them whatyou were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?\"\n\"Chandler","872":"(starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient,together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may beperceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(He falters andMonica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit.\"\n\"Rachel","873":"Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve everheard.\"\n\"Phoebe","874":"Really? I’ve heard better.\"\n\"Monica","875":"Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.\"\n\"Chandler","876":"(To Chandler) I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thingagain?\"\n\"Monica","877":"Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!\"\n\"Chandler","878":"(pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You’re a littlehigh maintenance.\"\n\"Monica","879":"Ahhh!\"\n\"Chandler","880":"I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’repassionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I thinkthat I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s goodtoo. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because Ilike … maintaining you.\"\n\"Monica","881":"(embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn’t even tell him to saythat. (They hug). All right you’re off my list.\"\n\"Chandler","882":"(happily) I’m off the list. (Sits on the couch.)\"\n\"Monica","883":"(sits next to him) Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me tobe your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.\"\n\"Chandler","884":"Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?\"\n\"Joey","885":"Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so…\"\n\"Phoebe","886":"Wow! That is a bad audition.\"\n\"Rachel","887":"How-how did you lose your job here?\"\n\"Joey","888":"Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be incharge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.\"\n\"Rachel","889":"He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and leftyou in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’snot right.\"\n\"Joey","890":"Yeah, what are ya gonna do?\"\n\"Rachel","891":"Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’mnot going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, Ireally shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him. (Goes to thecounter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that youhave to fire him…\"\n\"Gunther","892":"Okay.\"\n\"Rachel","893":"What?\"\n\"Gunther","894":"He can have his job back.\"\n\"Rachel","895":"That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got thatall straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.\"\n\"Joey","896":"That’s great. Thanks Rach.\"\n\"Rachel","897":"Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?\"\n\"Phoebe","898":"(returning from the bathroom) Rach, you’re in my seat.\"\n\"Rachel","899":"Oh, I’m sorry. (Gets up and moves.)\"\n\"Phoebe","900":"Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.\"\n\"Rachel","901":"Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.\"\n\"Phoebe","902":"Yeah, well, I kinda thought.\"\n\"Chandler","903":"Hey.\"\n\"Rachel","904":"Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of theother two guys to go out with, who would you pick?\"\n\"Ross","905":"No way.\"\n\"Joey","906":"I’m not answering that.\"\n\"Chandler","907":"Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I’m not answeringthat.\"\n\"Joey","908":"Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75.Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all togetherthat’s (pauses to figure the total) $12.75.\"\n\"Chandler","909":"This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phonebill in half.\"\n\"Woman","910":"Hi!\"\n\"Joey","911":"Hi!\"\n\"Woman","912":"How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?\"\n\"Joey","913":"Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.\"\n\"Woman","914":"Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such anice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?\"\n\"Joey","915":"Well, he’s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, Igood check with him—He says it’s okay. (She hands him her card.) Great! Thanks!Bye-bye!\"\n\"Ross","916":"Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn’t free?\"\n\"Joey","917":"It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great!I’m getting more dates than ever!\"\n\"Rachel","918":"Wait a minute, you’re only giving free stuff away to the prettygirls?\"\n\"Phoebe","919":"Yeah Joey that is so gross!\"\n\"Joey","920":"How about a scone on the house baby?\"\n\"Phoebe","921":"(giggles) I’m pretty.\"\n\"Ross","922":"Hey does anyone have any gum?\"\n\"Phoebe","923":"Oh I do! (She grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it andtaking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) Oh, y’know what? No.(Pause) Wait a second.

I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of mybook. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just ahealthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.

Only now, we call it the beach house.\"\n\"Monica","95":"I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!\"\n\"Mrs. Geller","96":"We’re sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got marriedafter you turned 30 you’d pay for it yourself.\"\n\"Monica","97":"You bought the beach house when I was 23!\"\n\"Mr. Geller","98":"Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can’t puta price on that sweetie.\"\n\"Mrs. Geller","99":"We really do feel bad about this though.\"\n\"Mr. Geller","100":"We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then thatwent to hell, so we redid the kitchen.\"\n\"Monica","101":"What about when I started dating Chandler?\"\n\"Mrs. Geller","102":"Well it was Chandler! We didn’t think\"\n\"Chandler","103":"Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.(Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)\"\n\"Monica","104":"I can’t believe it! That there is\"\n\"Mrs. Geller","105":"We\"\n\"Mr. Geller","106":"It seemed like such a simple idea.\"\n\"Mrs. Geller","107":"Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.\"\n\"Mr. Geller","108":"All right, enough! I don’t want to hear about it anymore!(Under his breath) Good luck, Chandler. (Chandler takes another drink.)\"\n\"Ross","109":"Okay! Now, I’m going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh,that’s soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massagehim with those.)\"\n\"Monica","110":"I can’t believe this.

He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape fromfat camp.\"\n\"Monica","352":"I wasn’t escaping.\"\n\"Ross","353":"Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?\"\n\"Monica","354":"I was trying to help out a squirrel.\"\n\"Ross","355":"You were trying to eat it!\"\n\"Chandler","356":"If\"\n\"Monica","357":"(takes the phone from Ross) Come on.

Y’know, I’m a little…I’m alittle embarrassed about it.\"\n\"Mr. Geller","452":"I understand completely, there’s nothing more horrifying thanembarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started datingJudy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him Iwas a lawyer.\"\n\"Chandler","453":"What did you do when they found out?\"\n\"Mr. Geller","454":"They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nodalong.

{"0":"Joey","1":"All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performedvery well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say thatin this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!"},

{"0":"Ross","1":"Why-why would I care about that?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’llbe."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’mgoing to apologize for all of the stupid things I do."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’thave to apologize."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"I would really love it if could do both."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"All right, I…I have to ask."},

{"0":"Ross","1":"What? That's like insanely easy!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at leastone, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica)."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, sotechnically I didn't lose."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"What? You forgot fourteen states?"},

{"0":"Ross","1":"You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that agroup of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map,or one of those round, colorful things called \"a globe?\" Hmm?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"What? That's impossible."},

{"0":"Chandler","1":"I am only"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"No, just give me another minute."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them,okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50before dinner."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Okay, but if you can't…no dinner!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"You're on!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot onthere that you don't have."},

{"0":"Monica","1":"Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here moreoften?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's likeold pumpkins or something."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"That's my pie!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Which smells delicious!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Uh-oh! Uh-oh!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"What?"},

{"0":"Tag","1":"I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is stillgood."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to yourgirlfriend?"},
{"0":"Tag","1":"We kinda broke up this morning."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Oh, I'm sorry."},
{"0":"Tag","1":"Yeah, so she went back to Ohio."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Ohio!! Thank you!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Huh! Where is the dog?!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"What dog? There-there's no dog here."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Yeah that dog left!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"There's no dog in here."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and thedog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, Ihave a dog in my room."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"What is it doing here?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (Shebends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers.May I please stay with you nice people?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5minutes, my throat will just close up!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(gasping) Really?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had areaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Well, it still has to go, right?"},
{"0":"Monica and Phoebe","1":"Why?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Okay, it's um…"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(interrupting him) Don't do it!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Don't do what?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say,\"Do what you have to do\") Okay, I hate dogs."},
{"0":"All","1":"What?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Are you crazy?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Are you out of your mind?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Why?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they arethinking, and that scares me a little bit."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treatout of my hand!!!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(scared) Is there a puppy here?"},
{"0":"Tag","1":"You don't like puppies?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(to Tag) Okay, you are new!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It'slike Ross not likin’ ice cream."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"You don't like ice cream?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"It's"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, Idon't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (Anawkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!"},

{"0":"Phoebe","1":"All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in aminute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Yeah."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amountof time to wait before you make a move?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Oh, I'd say about a month."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Really? I'd say 3 to 4."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Interesting."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"When it's your assistant, I would say never."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Becauseif he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Huh. A moo-point?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"(to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or didthat all just make sense?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’sobviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.  What he needs right now is for you to be his friend."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package isthis pretty, no one cares what's inside."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Hey!"},
{"0":"Tag","1":"Hey."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"How are you holding up?"},
{"0":"Tag","1":"Not bad."},

{"0":"Rachel","1":"So were you guys together a long time?"},
{"0":"Tag","1":"A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Now that she broke up with you?"},
{"0":"Tag","1":"Yeah."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Yeah. Hmmmm."},
{"0":"Tag","1":"It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall inlove and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Doyou ever have that feeling?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"No…Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you knowthat I figure it…it has to work out."},
{"0":"Tag","1":"Why?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Because, uh—it has to."},
{"0":"Tag","1":"You have all the answers, don't you?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Yeah, I know, I do. I really do."},
{"0":"Tag","1":"Hey, thanks for talking to me."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug)"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, youshould go for it!"},
{"0":"Tag","1":"What?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachelmoves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed)"},
{"0":"Tag","1":"What did Joey say? I like you back?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Uh, yeah, well, see, he… Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecureabout my back and, and…you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it,yeah!"},
{"0":"Tag","1":"Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said whathe said, because um, I'm attracted to you."},
{"0":"Tag","1":"Wow. (He starts to walk towards the railing.)"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that'scrazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing Iwant to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would bereally great if you said something right about now."},
{"0":"Tag","1":"(looking at the street) Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car! (Hepoints down to the street)"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"What?"},
{"0":"Tag","1":"Right there! That's my car! (Sound of a breaking car-window) Hey!!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else youwanna get off your chest?"},
{"0":"Tag","1":"I can't believe this! (He walks back in again)"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"(she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk andthey’re-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Ohlook, there they go, okay. (She hurries in, too)"},

{"0":"Monica","1":"Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Yeah, okay."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back toClunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn'teven know."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"That's not gonna work."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He'snot so smart."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Hey! I didn't know either."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Yeah, I knew."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Where's Chandler?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(comes out of the bathroom) Here I am."},

{"0":"Phoebe","1":"(interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now.Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Yeah, but, but look what I'm..."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into herroom)"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Why not?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Well, I, I should go in there."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"No. No, no. She doesn't want to see"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Why not?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Because you sent away the dog!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Oh, is it?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees thatChandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away."},

{"0":"Chandler","1":"And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out)"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Ross, you need some help?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying)Yes, please!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just makestuff up!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Hey! Tag's still talking to the police."},

{"0":"Chandler","1":"(to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things shemust have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window withher teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in…(Realizes, that Chandler starts tonot believing her) I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tellyou something, I have 49 states, and there are"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"It's up to you."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Oh, hi! How are you doing?"},

{"0":"Tag","1":"Um, I'm not."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out."},

{"0":"Chandler","1":"We heard you play all the way from your apartment!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Were you the ones called the cops?!"},

{"0":"Joey","1":"Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed)All right!"},
{"0":"Cecilia","1":"No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He’s notfinding it out for the first time! So, try it again."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)"},
{"0":"Cecilia","1":"Right. He’s not angry at the room either. Try it again, he ownsit! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns,"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Oh well—Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing.Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play differentcharacters. You’re so talented."},

{"0":"Joey","1":"Like-like what?"},
{"0":"Cecilia","1":"Well, let’s just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape ofMexican cinema would be very different today!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(impressed) Wow!"},
{"0":"Cecilia","1":"But… Well now, now’s a different time for me. (Starts tocry.)"},

{"0":"Joey","1":"Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate?"},
{"0":"Cecilia","1":"No! It’s because that way the camera only sees her! (She takes herhands off his face.) Do you wanna try it?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)"},
{"0":"Cecilia","1":"That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe alittle off, they should be maybe right like… (She grabs the back of his neck andkisses him passionately causing them to fall onto the couch.)"},

{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Because it’s my apartment!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Well, then I get to give him the cell phone."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all thecalls to China."},
{"0":"Tom","1":"Hi!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"(To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?"},

{"0":"Chandler","1":"I’m in the bathtub."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Oh. (She goes into the bathroom.) What’s wrong?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The saltdidn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’tcompliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"What?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different.(Pause) It’s interesting."},

{"0":"Chandler","1":"Uh-huh."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Umm, and looking at people differently."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"He didn’t say anything about that to me."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"What did he tell you?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, ofcourse the glue that holds this all together, the rules."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wantsto do what you and I did in London with someone."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"But what did he mean by rules?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Because he was looking at her differently."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"(from outside the bathroom) You guys?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Just a minute! (To Chandler) That’s Mrs. Tribbiani!"},

{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Fine."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"It’s a humdinger!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me."},

{"0":"Rachel","1":"I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get toname it when it’s a boy, and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heathor Blaine or Sequoia."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"I would—Sequoia?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Veto."},

{"0":"Ross","1":"Well, with everything that’s been going on lately, I haven’texactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn’t tell her I got Rachelpregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then Ilied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for notbreaking up with me sooner, you know?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine’s Day."},

The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speakuntil then.\"\n\"Rachel","371":"(silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That’sgreat!\"\n\"Ross","372":"Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how todeliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!\"\n\"Rachel","373":"Hi Dr. Long, how are you?\"\n\"Ross","374":"(to Rachel) Oh, you’re nice to her.\"\n\"Rachel","375":"She has the drugs!\"\n\"Dr. Long","376":"We’ll do a quick check.\"\n\"Rachel","377":"Okay.

Just some home remedies, butin my experience I’ve found that some of them are quite effective.\"\n\"Rachel","385":"Well, we are ready to try anything.\"\n\"Dr. Long","386":"Okay, there’s an herbal tea you can drink.\"\n\"Rachel","387":"Okay.\"\n\"Dr. Long","388":"You can take some caster oil, there’s eating spicy foods…\"\n\"Rachel","389":"Great! We will do all of those.\"\n\"Dr. Long","390":"…taking a long walk, and then there’s the one that’sproved most effective: sex.\"\n\"Ross","391":"You’ve got to be kidding me!\"\n\"Chandler","392":"Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!\"\n\"Joey","393":"You liked it? You really liked it?\"\n\"Chandler","394":"Oh-ho-ho, yeah!\"\n\"Joey","395":"Which part exactly?\"\n\"Chandler","396":"The whole thing!

You can borrowChandler—Chandler is good!\"\n\"Ross","417":"Monica, what is the matter with you?\"\n\"Monica","418":"Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.\"\n\"Rachel","419":"Why?

(Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-shethinks we’re engaged! Why? Why?

And it seemed like shedidn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of thishappened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose,throw it on, and-and just start telling people?\"\n\"Phoebe","1172":"No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.\"\n\"Ross","1173":"Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose! (Pause) Unless uh… (Pause)Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I woulddo.\"\n\"Chandler","1174":"Look, we can’t stay in here forever.\"\n\"Monica","1175":"Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn’tmake it to\"\n\"Chandler","1176":"This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to beashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (Theydo so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)\"\n\"Monica","1177":"Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?\"\n\"Mr. Geller","1178":"Of course. I’ll always be your dad.\"\n\"Chandler","1179":"I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, thatwasn’t for fun.\"\n\"Monica","1180":"It wasn’t fun?!\"\n\"Chandler","1181":"(To Monica) Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why… (To Mr. Geller)Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever wewant.\"\n\"Mr. Geller","1182":"Oh, I don’t think that. Before today I never thought of you twohaving sex at all. It was a simpler time.\"\n\"Monica","1183":"The truth is, Dad, we’re-we’re trying.\"\n\"Mr. Geller","1184":"What?\"\n\"Monica","1185":"Yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant.\"\n\"Mr. Geller","1186":"Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! (Points tothe closet) I’ll guard the door!\"\n\"Monica","1187":"Well, that’s okay dad, we-we can wait until later.\"\n\"Mr. Geller","1188":"Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t think so! Aren’t you ovulating?\"\n\"Monica","1189":"Daddy?!\"\n\"Mr. Geller","1190":"Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I weretrying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That’s how I gotmy bad hip.\"\n\"Chandler","1191":"That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet holein my head.\"\n\"Mr. Geller","1192":"This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, shewas…\"\n\"Monica","1193":"Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positionsyou and mom had sex.\"\n\"Mr. Geller","1194":"You’re right, you’re right. This is about your positions.Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, althoughit might feel good.\"\n\"Monica","1195":"I don’t feel good right now.\"\n\"Mr. Geller","1196":"But pleasure is important, (To Chandler) and it helps if the womanhas an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?\"\n\"Chandler","1197":"Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.\"\n\"Monica","1198":"Hey.\"\n\"Rachel","1199":"Hey. I need to tell you something.\"\n\"Monica","1200":"Well, now’s a good time.

It’s wrong. It’s… It isbigger than mine! (Rachel’s engagement ring.)\"\n\"Rachel","1207":"I know.\"\n\"Monica","1208":"You can’t marry him!\"\n\"Rachel","1209":"Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweetguy and he loves me so much.\"\n\"Monica","1210":"Well do you love him?\"\n\"Rachel","1211":"Sure.\"\n\"Monica","1212":"Sure?\"\n\"Rachel","1213":"Yeah, I mean whatever.\"\n\"Monica","1214":"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?\"\n\"Rachel","1215":"No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?\"\n\"Chandler","1216":"You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?\"\n\"Joey","1217":"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took herbreast out.\"\n\"Chandler","1218":"Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it looklike?!\"\n\"Joey","1219":"I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.\"\n\"Chandler","1220":"Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.\"\n\"Joey","1221":"Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. Idon’t want to hurt her.\"\n\"Chandler","1222":"Okay, look, just do it gently.\"\n\"Joey","1223":"You’re right. You’re right. I-I’ll go tell her now beforeRoss finds out and I’ll be gentle.

Our holidays are pretty traditional...\"\n\"Phoebe","1606":"So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me.

This doesn't concern you.\"\n\"Rachel","1610":"We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.\"\n\"Chandler","1611":"What? That's terrible!\"\n\"Phoebe","1612":"No-no, we do it every year!\"\n\"Chandler","1613":"Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.\"\n\"Phoebe","1614":"No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.\"\n\"Rachel","1615":"Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?\"\n\"Chandler","1616":"No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!\"\n\"Phoebe","1617":"Oh no, we have to!\"\n\"Chandler","1618":"No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.\"\n\"Phoebe","1619":"Well then, you should look with us.\"\n\"Chandler","1620":"Why?\"\n\"Rachel","1621":"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?\"\n\"Chandler","1622":"No, I have a great idea for a present for her.\"\n\"Phoebe","1623":"Oh, that's it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea! Oh yeah.\"\n\"Rachel","1624":"Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?\"\n\"Chandler","1625":"If I help, we can find 'em faster!\"\n\"Rachel","1626":"That's right!\"\n\"Phoebe","1627":"Ooh ooh, we have a live one!\"\n\"Rachel","1628":"Oh, it's a Macy's bag!\"\n\"Rachel","1629":"Oh.\"\n\"Phoebe","1630":"Ooh, who's it for?\"\n\"Rachel","1631":"(Reading from a tag that's attached to the shoe) \"Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you.\"\n\"Joey","1632":"Rach, these are for you.\"\n\"Rachel","1633":"Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.\"\n\"Joey","1634":"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.\"\n\"Chandler","1635":"OK, Pheebs, your turn.\"\n\"Phoebe","1636":"Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?\"\n\"Joey","1637":"Uh-huh.\"\n\"Phoebe","1638":"You guuuyys.\"\n\"Joey","1639":"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.\"\n\"Ross","1640":"You got me a cola drink?\"\n\"Chandler","1641":"And, a lemon lime.\"\n\"Ross","1642":"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.\"\n\"Chandler","1643":"And last but not least.\"\n\"Joey","1644":"They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.\"\n\"Ross","1645":"Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?\"\n\"Ross","1646":"Yeah!\"\n\"Monica","1647":"Come on Ben.\"\n\"Ross","1648":"Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...\"\n\"Chandler","1649":"(entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!\"\n\"Chandler","1650":"Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)\"\n\"Ross","1651":"What are you doing here, Santa?\"\n\"Chandler","1652":"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?\"\n\"Ross","1653":"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?\"\n\"Chandler","1654":"What?\"\n\"Monica","1655":"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.\"\n\"Ross","1656":"(to Chandler) What are you doing?\"\n\"Chandler","1657":"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!\"\n\"Ross","1658":"Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.\"\n\"Chandler","1659":"Why?\"\n\"Ross","1660":"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.\"\n\"Chandler","1661":"But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.\"\n\"Ross","1662":"I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.\"\n\"Chandler","1663":"Fine, I'll give the suit back.\"\n\"Monica","1664":"(to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)\"\n\"Chandler","1665":"Santa? Really?\"\n\"Monica","1666":"Yeah, is that okay?\"\n\"Chandler","1667":"Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?\"\n\"Monica","1668":"No.\"\n\"Chandler","1669":"Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.)\"\n\"Chandler","1670":"You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.\"\n\"Chandler","1671":"Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.\"\n\"Chandler","1672":"Good, God's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees Wendy) You're not gonna go?\"\n\"Wendy","1673":"Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.\"\n\"Chandler","1674":"Ah. Thanks.\"\n\"Wendy","1675":"Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.\"\n\"Chandler","1676":"Ah. (The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing.\"\n\"Monica","1677":"Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.\"\n\"Others","1678":"(simultaneously) Merry Christmas! (except for Phoebe...)\"\n\"Phoebe","1679":"(simultaneous to the others) Ble-blah-blar Blargh!\"\n\"Chandler","1680":"Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!\"\n\"Monica","1681":"So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?\"\n\"Chandler","1682":"Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.\"\n\"Monica","1683":"Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.\"\n\"Chandler","1684":"It is. Did I... not tell you about her?\"\n\"Monica","1685":"Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?\"\n\"Chandler","1686":"I sent them home.\"\n\"Monica","1687":"Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?\"\n\"Chandler","1688":"Uhh, uh...\"\n\"Ross","1689":"(in a low voice) Answer faster, answer faster!\"\n\"Chandler","1690":"I don't know!\"\n\"Ross","1691":"(in the same low voice) Answer better, answer better!\"\n\"Chandler","1692":"I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.\"\n\"Monica","1693":"What does she do there?\"\n\"Chandler","1694":"Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.\"\n\"Monica","1695":"She did WHAT?\"\n\"Chandler","1696":"BE-LOW me!\"\n\"Joey","1697":"Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?\"\n\"Monica","1698":"*What*??\"\n\"Chandler","1699":"Well, she... she didn't win...\"\n\"Monica","1700":"Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.\"\n\"Chandler","1701":"Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...\"\n\"Rachel","1702":"(interrupting him) Oh Chandler, stop talking!\"\n\"Chandler","1703":"Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.\"\n\"Monica","1704":"Okay.\"\n\"Chandler","1705":"I'm serious!\"\n\"Monica","1706":"Okay!\"\n\"Chandler","1707":"Merry Christmas.\"\n\"Monica","1708":"Merry Christmas.\"\n\"Chandler","1709":"Merry Christmas, you guys!\"\n\"Others","1710":"(simultaneously) Yeah, Merry... Christmas. (again, Phoebe...)\"\n\"Phoebe","1711":"(simultaneous to the others) Blah blargah, blar-blab.\"\n\"Chandler","1712":"(hanging up the phone) The wife says \"Hi!\".\"\n\"Wendy","1713":"Ah. Fun conversation?\"\n\"Chandler","1714":"Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.\"\n\"Wendy","1715":"Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible? (She gets hold of Chandler's tie, slowly moving her hands upwards on the tie, getting closer and closer to him, seductive.)\"\n\"Chandler","1716":"This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.\"\n\"Chandler","1717":"Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! (He takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)\"\n\"Wendy","1718":"(laughs) ...Missy?\"\n\"Chandler","1719":"I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?\"\n\"Wendy","1720":"You are to me... (She gets closer again, putting her arms around his torso.)\"\n\"Chandler","1721":"(flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.) Look, I'm, I'm married!\"\n\"Wendy","1722":"So? I'm married. (Showing him the ring on her finger.)\"\n\"Chandler","1723":"I'm *happily* married.\"\n\"Wendy","1724":"Oh. - What's *that* like?\"\n\"Chandler","1725":"Right. So, I'm sorry...\"\n\"Wendy","1726":"Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?\"\n\"Chandler","1727":"Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.\"\n\"Wendy","1728":"Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?\"\n\"Chandler","1729":"I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!\"\n\"Monica","1730":"Really?\"\n\"Chandler","1731":"You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?\"\n\"Monica","1732":"Well, not anymore.\"\n\"Chandler","1733":"But we don't do that.\"\n\"Monica","1734":"I know, I just thought it would be fun.\"\n\"Chandler","1735":"How drunk are you?\"\n\"Monica","1736":"Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.\"\n\"Chandler","1737":"(thinks) That's the perfect amount!\"\n\"Monica","1738":"Okay!\"\n\"Monica","1739":"(breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?\"\n\"Chandler","1740":"What?\"\n\"Monica","1741":"This doesn't feel weird!\"\n\"Chandler","1742":"I know.\"\n\"Monica","1743":"You're a really good kisser.\"\n\"Chandler","1744":"Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?\"\n\"Monica","1745":"Hm-hmm!\"\n\"Chandler","1746":"Okay!\"\n\"Monica","1747":"Wow! You are really fast!\"\n\"Chandler","1748":"It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.\"\n\"Monica","1749":"We're gonna see each other naked.\"\n\"Chandler","1750":"Yep!\"\n\"Monica","1751":"Do you wanna do it at the same time?\"\n\"Chandler","1752":"Count of three?\"\n\"Monica","1753":"One!\"\n\"Chandler","1754":"Two!\"\n\"Monica","1755":"Two!\"\n\"Both","1756":"Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)\"\n\"Chandler","1757":"Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.\"\n\"Monica","1758":"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!\"\n\"Chandler","1759":"Eh! (They start making out again)\"\n\"Chandler","1760":"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?\"\n\"Monica","1761":"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.\"\n\"Chandler","1762":"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.\"\n\"Monica","1763":"I think you're better than you think you are.\"\n\"Chandler","1764":"Really? Okay, so...\"\n\"Monica","1765":"(interrupting) Know when to stop.\"\n\"Chandler","1766":"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?\"\n\"Monica","1767":"Yeah. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around:) Don't do the dance.\"\n\"Chandler","1768":"Right!\"\n\"Monica","1769":"I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.\"\n\"Chandler","1770":"Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.\"\n\"Monica","1771":"You're so efficient. I love you!\"\n\"Chandler","1772":"Let's go! (Starts to leave.)\"\n\"Monica","1773":"No-no-no, wait! We need something old!\"\n\"Chandler","1774":"Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.\"\n\"Monica","1775":"That'll work!\"\n\"Chandler","1776":"I don't think so.\"\n\"Monica","1777":"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!\"\n\"Chandler","1778":"(looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)\"\n\"Monica","1779":"That's stealing!\"\n\"Chandler","1780":"No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.\"\n\"Monica","1781":"Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)\"\n\"Chandler","1782":"Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)\"\n\"Monica","1783":"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.\"\n\"Chandler","1784":"Ehh.\"\n\"Monica","1785":"Eh, you work for that.\"\n\"Chandler","1786":"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.\"\n\"Monica","1787":"You do?!\"\n\"Chandler","1788":"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.\"\n\"Monica","1789":"Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?\"\n\"Chandler","1790":"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.\"\n\"Monica","1791":"You thought about that?\"\n\"Chandler","1792":"Yeah.\"\n\"Monica","1793":"How many kids were we gonna have?\"\n\"Chandler","1794":"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.\"\n\"Monica","1795":"What else did you think about?\"\n\"Chandler","1796":"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.\"\n\"Monica","1797":"(laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.\"\n\"Chandler","1798":"Sure you do.\"\n\"Monica","1799":"No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.\"\n\"Chandler","1800":"You sure?\"\n\"Monica","1801":"Uh-hmm.\"\n\"Chandler","1802":"I love you so much.\"\n\"Monica","1803":"I love you. (They kiss.)\"\n\"Rachel","1804":"(opens her present from Ross; it's a dark-red scarf) Oohh, I love it!\"\n\"Ross","1805":"Really? You're not gonna return it?\"\n\"Rachel","1806":"Well, not this second!\"\n\"Phoebe","1807":"(at the window) Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!\"\n\"Rachel","1808":"Oh wow, it's so beautiful...\"\n\"Ross","1809":"Wow, it really is!\"\n\"Monica","1810":"\"Wendy\" is a fat girl name.\"\n\"Phoebe","1811":"Aren't we done with that?\"\n\"Monica","1812":"Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?\"\n\"Chandler","1813":"Hey!\"\n\"Ross","1814":"Oh my god...\"\n\"Joey","1815":"Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!\"\n\"Monica","1816":"What are you doing here?\"\n\"Chandler","1817":"I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.\"\n\"Joey","1818":"Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?\"\n\"Chandler","1819":"Monica.\"\n\"Joey","1820":"Got ya. (blinks an eye)\"\n\"Chandler","1821":"I never want to leave you again!\"\n\"Monica","1822":"But I thought if you left, you get fired.\"\n\"Chandler","1823":"Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.\"\n\"Monica","1824":"What?\"\n\"Ross","1825":"What, you, you really quit your job?\"\n\"Chandler","1826":"Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?\"\n\"Rachel","1827":"What do you really want to do?\"\n\"Chandler","1828":"(realizing) I have *not* thought this through!\"\n\"Monica","1829":"Oh my god!\"\n\"Chandler","1830":"I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.\"\n\"Monica","1831":"No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!\"\n\"Chandler","1832":"Thanks!\"\n\"Phoebe","1833":"Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.\"\n\"Chandler","1834":"(flattered) Ahh...\"\n\"Phoebe","1835":"Now give me my real gift.\"\n\"Phoebe","1836":"(to Chandler) Thank you.\"\n\"Chandler","1837":"(to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya..

I can't return this.\"\n\"Chandler","1841":"I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.\"\n\"Joey","1842":"Mine's is to Lilian Myers.\"\n\"Chandler","1843":"I don't have a *job*!\"\n\"Chandler","1844":"Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica:) Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!\"\n\"Monica","1845":"You are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to Chandler) Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?\"\n\"Chandler","1846":"Hey\"\n\"Joey","1847":"Hey. So where's Mon?\"\n\"Chandler","1848":"Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.\"\n\"Joey","1849":"And you're not helping?\"\n\"Chandler","1850":"I tried, but apparantly singing \"I will survive\" in a helium voice   - not helping.\"\n\"Ross","1851":"Hey you guys!\"\n\"Joey and Chandler","1852":"(start to sing) Hey! Happy birthday ...\"\n\"Rachel","1853":"Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.\"\n\"Ross","1854":"Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly (points   to Molly). Molly, Chandler, Joey.\"\n\"Joey and Chandler","1855":"Hi.\"\n\"Molly","1856":"Hi.\"\n\"Ross","1857":"Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.\"\n\"Joey","1858":"You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.\"\n\"Rachel","1859":"Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.\"\n\"Molly","1860":"No, you stay, I'll do it (takes Emma from Rachel).\"\n\"Rachel","1861":"OK, thank you.\"\n\"Molly","1862":"Nice to meet you guys (to Chandler and Joey).\"\n\"Joey","1863":"Yeah, you too.\"\n\"Rachel","1864":"Oh, wow, Molly is just great!\"\n\"Ross","1865":"Yeah.\"\n\"Chandler","1866":"Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.\"\n\"Rachel","1867":"What? You really think she's hot?\"\n\"Chandler","1868":"Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.\"\n\"Rachel","1869":"And Joey?\"\n\"Joey","1870":"How do you think she's doing?\"\n\"Rachel","1871":"Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?\"\n\"Ross","1872":"Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....\"\n\"Rachel","1873":"Thank you! (goes to get coffee)\"\n\"Chandler","1874":"Now that Rachel's gone?\"\n\"Rachel","1875":"So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. (Joey and Chandler clap their   hands)\"\n\"Phoebe","1876":"Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?\"\n\"Mike","1877":"Lima.\"\n\"Phoebe","1878":"No. It starts with a \"v\" and ends with an \"x\". Helpfully   with a \"to\" in the middle.\"\n\"Mike","1879":"You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS \"vtox\".   (opens the kitchen cabinet) Oh god! Oh!\"\n\"Phoebe","1880":"What?\"\n\"Mike","1881":"OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a   rat in your cupboard.\"\n\"Phoebe","1882":"(relived) Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.\"\n\"Mike","1883":"What, is he your pet rat?\"\n\"Phoebe","1884":"Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who   I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on   the plate of cookies.\"\n\"Mike","1885":"You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary,   and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.\"\n\"Phoebe","1886":"What are those?\"\n\"Mike","1887":"I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get   rid of it!\"\n\"Phoebe","1888":"OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.\"\n\"Mike","1889":"Thank you.\"\n\"Phoebe","1890":"So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.   (Mike throws out everything in his mouth)\"\n\"Rachel","1891":"Hello.\"\n\"Gavin","1892":"Hello\"\n\"Rachel","1893":"Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma   yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.\"\n\"Gavin","1894":"For what?\"\n\"Rachel","1895":"Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous   and arrogant and obnoxious ...\"\n\"Gavin","1896":"Is this your first appology?\"\n\"Rachel","1897":"No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And   I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.\"\n\"Heather","1898":"Good morning!\"\n\"Rachel","1899":"Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf,   I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry,   obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait   'till it's finished.\"\n\"Gavin","1900":"What?\"\n\"Rachel","1901":"I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!\"\n\"Gavin","1902":"I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her   skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.\"\n\"Rachel","1903":"Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.\"\n\"Gavin","1904":"Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?\"\n\"Rachel","1905":"Oh yeah, I'm jealous. \"Oh Gavin, please, please look at   my ass\". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just   think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your   subordinate.\"\n\"Gavin","1906":"I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.\"\n\"Rachel","1907":"That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know   that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had   a deap meaningful relationship.\"\n\"Gavin","1908":"Huh. What's Tag's last name?\"\n\"Rachel","1909":"It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last   name. It was just \"Tag\". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.\"\n\"Gavin","1910":"But it was a deap meaningful relationship.\"\n\"Rachel","1911":"Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely   right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name   was Morgan! Huh!\"\n\"Gavin","1912":"It was Jones.\"\n\"Rachel","1913":"Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?\"\n\"Joey","1914":"Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.\"\n\"Molly","1915":"You mean, when you were a baby.\"\n\"Joey","1916":"Sure.\"\n\"Monica","1917":"Would you stop staring at her?\"\n\"Chandler","1918":"I wasn't staring. I was leering.\"\n\"Monica","1919":"What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind   of way.\"\n\"Ross","1920":"Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there   in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me   feel like I earned it.\"\n\"Chandler","1921":"Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.\"\n\"Monica","1922":"Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl   for once.\"\n\"Molly","1923":"(to Ross) I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.\"\n\"Ross","1924":"Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you   - wovyou dovyou ...\"\n\"Molly","1925":"Bye\"\n\"Monica","1926":"They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.\"\n\"Molly","1927":"I think it's sweet. (goes to leave)\"\n\"Ross, Joey and Chandler","1928":"Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.\"\n\"Rachel","1929":"(to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if   you didn't go after her.\"\n\"Joey","1930":"Why not?\"\n\"Rachel","1931":"Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything   to, you know, drive her away.\"\n\"Joey","1932":"So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call   her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds   about right.\"\n\"Ross","1933":"Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just   forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.\"\n\"Joey","1934":"Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told   me I can't have it makes me want her even more!\"\n\"Ross","1935":"What are you, a child?\"\n\"Joey","1936":"Yes!\"\n\"Ross","1937":"Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy   on someone else.\"\n\"Joey","1938":"Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)\"\n\"Monica","1939":"(to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)\"\n\"Phoebe","1940":"Hey Mikey\"\n\"Mike","1941":"Hey P\"\n\"Phoebe","1942":"What are you doing?\"\n\"Mike","1943":"Setting rat traps.\"\n\"Phoebe","1944":"To kill Bob??\"\n\"Mike","1945":"No, no, to test his neck strength.\"\n\"Phoebe","1946":"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna   capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can   maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.\"\n\"Mike","1947":"Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.\"\n\"Phoebe","1948":"I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! (looks at   cabinet under sink) Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies!   Bob's a mom!\"\n\"Mike","1949":"Better think of a new name for him.\"\n\"Phoebe","1950":"I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.\"\n\"Mike","1951":"I don't know, I mean I'm not sure (they hear cracking voice from   somewhere else in the kitchen, probably a rat caught in a trap) ...\"\n\"Phoebe","1952":"Oh my god, we killed Bob!\"\n\"Mike","1953":"Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.\"\n\"Phoebe","1954":"Suzie? (Runs over there to check)\"\n\"Ross","1955":"Whazzup??\"\n\"Chandler","1956":"Seriously dude, 3 years ago.\"\n\"Ross","1957":"Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep   an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?\"\n\"Chandler","1958":"You don't trust him?\"\n\"Ross","1959":"Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked   for her daughter, the \"hot nanny\".\"\n\"Chandler","1960":"Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference?   Because I could get a job any day now.\"\n\"Ross","1961":"You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm   sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do   this for me?\"\n\"Chandler","1962":"Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know   as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not,   he's going to have sex with it.\"\n\"Ross","1963":"Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. (pause)\"\n\"Chandler","1964":"Picturing that tree?\"\n\"Ross","1965":"I am, yes.\"\n\"Chandler","1966":"Where you going, Joe?\"\n\"Joey","1967":"For a walk.\"\n\"Chandler","1968":"Oh. You mind if I join you?\"\n\"Joey","1969":"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize   my thoughts.\"\n\"Chandler","1970":"Your thoughts? Plural?\"\n\"Joey","1971":"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta   see her!\"\n\"Chandler","1972":"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.\"\n\"Joey","1973":"Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me!   She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable   boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over   there?\"\n\"Chandler","1974":"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.\"\n\"Joey","1975":"Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the   world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.\"\n\"Chandler","1976":"Great novels?\"\n\"Joey","1977":"Fine ... mediocre porn\"\n\"Gavin","1978":"Gavin Mitchelle's office.\"\n\"Rachel","1979":"Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone)   Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll   pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)\"\n\"Gavin","1980":"Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary. (Rachel is upset)\"\n\"Rachel","1981":"Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.\"\n\"Gavin","1982":"Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah. (hangs up) (to Rachel) Yes?\"\n\"Rachel","1983":"If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?\"\n\"Gavin","1984":"Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your   pad three hours ago. (Rachel throws away that paper) Man, I really bug you,   don't I?\"\n\"Rachel","1985":"Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact,   from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to   you, you \"momma's boy\", starting right now.\"\n\"Monica","1986":"Hey Rach!\"\n\"Rachel","1987":"Hi!\"\n\"Monica","1988":"Ready for your birthday lunch?\"\n\"Rachel","1989":"Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce   you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin   Mitchelle.\"\n\"Gavin","1990":"Pleased to meet you.\"\n\"Monica","1991":"Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?\"\n\"Rachel","1992":"Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his   mother.\"\n\"Gavin","1993":"Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.   (leaves)\"\n\"Rachel","1994":"Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!\"\n\"Monica","1995":"You were just being so nice to him!\"\n\"Rachel","1996":"I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?\"\n\"Rachel","1997":"Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!\"\n\"Monica","1998":"Right there! That was so fake!\"\n\"Rachel","1999":"Shh!\"\n\"Rachel","2000":"(to Monica) I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the   last person I want to see.\"\n\"Monica","2001":"Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.\"\n\"Rachel","2002":"God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy   hates me.\"\n\"Monica","2003":"Does he?\"\n\"Rachel","2004":"What?\"\n\"Monica","2005":"Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first   grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly   had a crush on me?\"\n\"Rachel","2006":"Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet   to see if he can knock you over.\"\n\"Molly","2007":"(with Emma in a basinet) She's out, I'm gonna take her home.\"\n\"Rachel","2008":"Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what all the guys   see in her?\"\n\"Monica","2009":"Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! (put her glass down)\"\n\"Joey","2010":"Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?\"\n\"Rachel","2011":"Yeah, sure!\"\n\"Joey","2012":"Oh ... (Starts to sing) Happy birth ... (sees Molly leaving) oh, see you   later (runs after Molly)\"\n\"Monica","2013":"Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!\"\n\"Rachel","2014":"Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the   box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)\"\n\"Phoebe","2015":"Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!\"\n\"Mike","2016":"Yeah. We have rat babies now.\"\n\"Rachel","2017":"Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?\"\n\"Monica","2018":"So this is what a stroke feels like.\"\n\"Phoebe","2019":"I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility   now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're   a mother.\"\n\"Rachel","2020":"Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?\"\n\"Phoebe","2021":"No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed   them.\"\n\"Rachel","2022":"whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?\"\n\"Phoebe","2023":"Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone   can afford help. (she and Mike leave)\"\n\"Ross","2024":"Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.\"\n\"Chandler","2025":"(In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.\"\n\"Ross","2026":"We have to stop them before something happens!\"\n\"Chandler","2027":"(still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the   door)\"\n\"Joey","2028":"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline.   It takes a lot of hard work.\"\n\"Molly","2029":"So where did you study?\"\n\"Joey","2030":"Oh, I didn't go to college.\"\n\"Molly","2031":"No, where did you study acting?\"\n\"Joey","2032":"Molly ... people don't study acting ...\"\n\"Ross","2033":"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?\"\n\"Molly","2034":"Sure, I'll go check on Emma.\"\n\"Ross","2035":"Thanx.\"\n\"Joey","2036":"(upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess??\"\n\"Ross","2037":"What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?\"\n\"Joey","2038":"No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair.   What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?   Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,   and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this   way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.\"\n\"Ross and Chandler","2039":"Come on! Joe!\"\n\"Joey","2040":"Ok (admits)\"\n\"Woman","2041":"Hi, is Molly here?\"\n\"Ross","2042":"Yeah, come on in. Molly?\"\n\"Molly","2043":"(goes out of the room) Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha (they kiss on the lips   in a romantic way). (to Ross) I'll see you tomorrow.\"\n\"Ross","2044":"Ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have   no problem.\"\n\"Joey","2045":"It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at him) The   princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!\"\n\"Phoebe","2046":"Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing   the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.\"\n\"Mike","2047":"Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve   around their rats?\"\n\"Phoebe","2048":"Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.\"\n\"Mike","2049":"Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate   and there are hundreds of them?\"\n\"Phoebe","2050":"Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.\"\n\"Mike","2051":"Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a \"love   the one you're with\" kind of animals.\"\n\"Phoebe","2052":"No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what   are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then   each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... (starts counting with her fingers)   That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?\"\n\"Mike","2053":"Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let   the box of rats ruin our lives.\"\n\"Phoebe","2054":"Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away.   But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's   favorites.\"\n\"Mike","2055":"It's gonna be ok.\"\n\"Phoebe","2056":"You must think I'm crazy.\"\n\"Mike","2057":"No, I think you're sweet.\"\n\"Phoebe","2058":"Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go.   I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to   my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven't   told you about that yet, have I?\"\n\"Monica","2059":"Hey!\"\n\"Rachel","2060":"Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?\"\n\"Monica","2061":"No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?\"\n\"Rachel","2062":"Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.\"\n\"Monica","2063":"Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from   your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows).\"\n\"Rachel","2064":"Mmm hmm.\"\n\"Gavin","2065":"Yeah, hey. (comes in to the balcony)\"\n\"Monica","2066":"Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.\"\n\"Rachel","2067":"No.\"\n\"Gavin","2068":"Nice party.\"\n\"Rachel","2069":"Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at (looks   at his watch) ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...\"\n\"Monica","2070":"(from inside) Again, you're welcome.\"\n\"Gavin","2071":"Look, I'll just give you this and go.\"\n\"Rachel","2072":"Oh, you bought me a present! Why?\"\n\"Gavin","2073":"Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There   are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you   the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.\"\n\"Rachel","2074":"Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card (opens   the card). \"From Gavin\"\n\"Gavin","2075":"I really mean it.\"\n\"Rachel","2076":"(opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful.\"\n\"Gavin","2077":"You don't mind? (puts it around her neck) Well, what do you know, it fits!\"\n\"Rachel","2078":"See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such   a hard time?\"\n\"Gavin","2079":"I'm not sure.\"\n\"Rachel","2080":"Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.\"\n\"Gavin","2081":"I do have feelings for you.\"\n\"Rachel","2082":"You do?\"\n\"Gavin","2083":"Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.\"\n\"Rachel","2084":"See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion   of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)\"\n\"Chandler","2085":"(sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid, I was petrified (very happy)\"\n\"Phoebe","2086":"(walks in) Hey\"\n\"Chandler","2087":"(normal voice) Hi\"\n\"Phoebe","2088":"Listen, I think I've left something here.\"\n\"Chandler","2089":"Oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is yours?\"\n\"Phoebe","2090":"(likes the jacket) No, but I like it. I think I left one of   my rat babies.\"\n\"Chandler","2091":"Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.\"\n\"Monica","2092":"Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! (screams from another room)\"\n\"Phoebe","2093":"(realizes) Ooh, maybe that's him!\"\n\"Chandler","2094":": Hey!\"\n\"Ross","2095":"Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?\"\n\"Chandler","2096":": Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever\"\n\"Ross","2097":"OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?\"\n\"Chandler","2098":": No!\"\n\"Ross","2099":"OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.\"\n\"Chandler","2100":": Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said\"\n\"Ross","2101":"Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,\"\n\"Chandler","2102":": So are you gonna...talk to her?\"\n\"Ross","2103":"Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!\"\n\"Chandler","2104":": You know when \"That's fine\" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!\"\n\"Ross","2105":"No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know\"\n\"Chandler","2106":": No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?\"\n\"Ross","2107":"I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.\"\n\"Chandler","2108":": Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!\"\n\"Ross","2109":"Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental\"\n\"Chandler","2110":": Why did I get married?!\"\n\"Joey","2111":": Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I\"\n\"Phoebe","2112":": Well it depends.\"\n\"Joey","2113":": On...?\"\n\"Phoebe","2114":": On how far along he's in the sex change process!\"\n\"Monica","2115":": No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,\"\n\"Joey","2116":": Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!\"\n\"Phoebe","2117":": Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...\"\n\"Joey","2118":": Oh man! I have to get those done too?!\"\n\"Phoebe","2119":": Wow! Talking about high maintenance\"\n\"Joey","2120":": Hey hey! You dye your hair!\"\n\"Phoebe","2121":": I'm a woman!\"\n\"Joey","2122":": Arghhh! Double standards!\"\n\"Phoebe","2123":": Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?\"\n\"Monica","2124":": Only if I don't have to get up and sing.\"\n\"Phoebe","2125":": But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out\"\n\"Monica","2126":": It's just, I'm not good at singing.\"\n\"Phoebe","2127":": Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?\"\n\"Monica","2128":": No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!\"\n\"Phoebe","2129":": OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.\"\n\"Monica","2130":": So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?\"\n\"Phoebe","2131":": While drinking...\"\n\"Monica","2132":": I'm there!\"\n\"Rachel","2133":": Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.\"\n\"Phoebe","2134":": Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there\"\n\"Rachel","2135":": No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.\"\n\"Phoebe","2136":": Oh my god.\"\n\"Monica","2137":": You kissed him?\"\n\"Rachel","2138":": Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...\"\n\"Monica","2139":": Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?\"\n\"Phoebe","2140":": It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.\"\n\"Monica","2141":": Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?\"\n\"Rachel","2142":": You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...\"\n\"Monica","2143":": I thought you hated him?\"\n\"Rachel","2144":": You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!\"\n\"Monica","2145":": So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?\"\n\"Rachel","2146":": I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't\"\n\"Monica","2147":": Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross\"\n\"Rachel","2148":": Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...\"\n\"Phoebe","2149":": Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!\"\n\"Salon girl","2150":": Hi\"\n\"Joey","2151":": Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.\"\n\"Salon girl","2152":"Name?\"\n\"Joey","2153":"Chandler Bing.\"\n\"Salon girl","2154":"Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.\"\n\"Joey","2155":": OK Thanks.\"\n\"Sonia","2156":": I'll take care of it\"\n\"Joey","2157":": Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?\"\n\"Sonia","2158":": Oh absolutely.\"\n\"Joey","2159":": Oh good...\"\n\"Sonia","2160":": Are you looking to meet somebody?\"\n\"Joey","2161":": All right let's just do this.\"\n\"Sonia","2162":": We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...\"\n\"Joey","2163":": Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!\"\n\"Chandler","2164":": Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?\"\n\"Ross","2165":"Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.\"\n\"Chandler","2166":": Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,\"\n\"Ross","2167":"That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?\"\n\"Chandler","2168":": What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!\"\n\"Ross","2169":"I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me\"\n\"Chandler","2170":": Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing\"\n\"Ross","2171":"No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.\"\n\"Chandler","2172":": Did she go out with him?\"\n\"Ross","2173":"No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.\"\n\"Chandler","2174":": Ah! The high road...\"\n\"Ross","2175":"You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!\"\n\"Chandler","2176":": Are you trying to get everybody divorced?\"\n\"Ross","2177":": You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the\"\n\"Chandler","2178":": I thought I had to make the jokes!\"\n\"Ross","2179":"Don't you have to be at work?\"\n\"Chandler","2180":": Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it.\"\n\"Ross","2181":"Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here�s a question: \"Would you..."},

{"0":"Gavin","1":": I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick"},
{"0":"Gavin","1":": Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": Oh no no no"},
{"0":"Gavin","1":": So I had fun last night"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": So did I"},
{"0":"Gavin","1":": Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": It's just a cold"},
{"0":"Gavin","1":": Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum..."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": What? What's the matter?"},
{"0":"Gavin","1":": What's Ross doing to you on that picture?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny."},
{"0":"Gavin","1":": Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really."},
{"0":"Gavin","1":": Yeah! But you said not to worry about..."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!"},
{"0":"Molly","1":": Hi!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": Oh! Molly! You're not Ross."},

{"0":"Rachel","1":": Right, right, yes!"},
{"0":"Molly","1":": Don't panic!"},

{"0":"Rachel","1":": OK."},

{"0":"Rachel","1":": There isn't. There is totally isn't."},
{"0":"Gavin","1":": You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be a"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in"},
{"0":"Gavin","1":": It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a piece of advice?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": Yes"},
{"0":"Gavin","1":": I think you should talk to Ross about all this."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin"},
{"0":"Gavin","1":": Don't be. It's just bad timing."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": So seriously...rodeo clown?"},
{"0":"Gavin","1":": One of the best, ma'am, one of the best..."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":": \"No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!\" Thank you!"},

{"0":"Phoebe","1":": All the time when you're cooking."},
{"0":"Monica","1":": What?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":": Yeah you're always singing \"Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy\""},
{"0":"Monica","1":": Yeah I do rock that one."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":": OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":": Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing..."},
{"0":"Mike","1":": Well I've got a book around..."},
{"0":"Monica","1":": \"Delta Dawn\""},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace"},
{"0":"Woman","1":": You already hit on me an hour ago"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Right, so that's a firm \"no\". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": By drowning or...?!"},
{"0":"Michelle","1":": Why would he break up with me?"},
{"0":"Her friend","1":": I don't know sweetie."},
{"0":"Michelle","1":": All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. I mean, am I so unlovable?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": Well..."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"I know! (he stands)"},
{"0":"Mike","1":": All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of \"I touch myself\". Coming up next we've got Monica"},
{"0":"Monica","1":": Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":": Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone"},
{"0":"Monica","1":": Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing \"Delta Dawn\""},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":": Can you totally see through her shirt ?"},
{"0":"Mike","1":": Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra."},
{"0":"Monica","1":": \"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?\""},
{"0":"Joey","1":": Hey, I need your help."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":": Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":": You may be a sissy but I'll still (pound you out on ground). All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":": All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so"},

{"0":"Chandler","1":": All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you."},
{"0":"Joey","1":": What, what."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine"},
{"0":"Joey","1":": Oh my God!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": Yeah, well, I guess you don�t need my help Victor Victoria!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":": Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don�t know if I can take anymore"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch."},
{"0":"Monica","1":": \"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y\". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":": Every little bit of you!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":": I can�t believe I did this. I can�t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that"},
{"0":"Mike","1":": Sure."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":": Mon', not that you didn�t sound good, but..."},
{"0":"Monica","1":": Good? Didn�t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That�s is the best gift ever."},
{"0":"Mike","1":": Also a good gift? Underwear."},
{"0":"Michelle","1":": Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"But, what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it."},
{"0":"Michelle","1":": It�s so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with me, because it�s like you lose a boyfriend,"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Uh-ah!"},
{"0":"Michelle","1":": No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(pfew). Good choice Ross."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I�ve been looking for you everywhere!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o� clock. So I was hoping you and I could have a"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Oh, yeah, yeah that�s Michelle."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": Who?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Oh, just this woman I�ve been seeing."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": You�ve being seeing someone?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Yeah, didn�t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven�t being going out for too long, but rather there is this"},
{"0":"Michelle","1":": What are you taking amoxicillin for?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that�s"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":": Hi, and I am also Emma�s mother."},
{"0":"Michelle","1":": Ah, who is Emma?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"I told you about my daughter."},
{"0":"Michelle","1":": This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": And done!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":": Oh my God! I didn�t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":": Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about"},
{"0":"Joey","1":": Thank you so much."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": No problem."},
{"0":"Joey","1":": Listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": Yeah."},
{"0":"Joey","1":": Comb my eyelashes."},
{"0":"Monica","1":": Ok, for my next song I think I�ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":": Oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": I am sorry I am late. You�ll understand when you�ll see Joey."},
{"0":"Monica","1":": Honey, you�re just in time, I�m about to sing another song!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": Really? In front of all this people?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":": And they love me!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":": Oh my God!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":": Yes, she gives the people what they want."},
{"0":"Monica","1":": All right, watch!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":": \"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this\"\n\"Chandler","2":": Are those my wife�s nipples?\"\n\"Phoebe","3":": Oh? Isn�t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.\"\n\"Chandler","4":": I gotta stop this.\"\n\"Monica","5":": Oh, who cares, they still love me! \"I am so excited...\"\n\"Chandler","6":": You, touching yourself, out!\"\n\"Rachel","7":": Wow. She does that a lot!\"\n\"Michelle","8":": Ross, you didn�t tell me you were a doctor!\"\n\"Rachel","9":": What, what, wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like\"\n\"Michelle","10":": Actually about an hour and a half.\"\n\"Ross","11":"I told you it wasn�t long, but there is an amazing connection between us.\"\n\"Michelle","12":": You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!\"\n\"Ross","13":"Are you kidding?\"\n\"Michelle","14":": Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?\"\n\"Ross","15":"We�ll see.\"\n\"Rachel","16":": Ok, Ross, what�s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?\"\n\"Ross","17":"I don�t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?\"\n\"Rachel","18":": How do you know about that?\"\n\"Ross","19":"Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...\"\n\"Michelle","20":": Emma.\"\n\"Ross","21":"When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?\"\n\"Rachel","22":": Oh, that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?\"\n\"Michelle","23":": No, actually, see I had to pee, �cause I can�t use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites.\"\n\"Ross","24":"Ok, Michelle, it�s time to go.\"\n\"Michelle","25":": Well, call me!\"\n\"Ross","26":"Ok.\"\n\"Michelle","27":": No, wait, you don�t have my phone number!\"\n\"Ross","28":"You know, if it�s meant to be, I�ll guess it. Bye, bye.\"\n\"Rachel","29":": Score.\"\n\"Ross","30":"Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on\"\n\"Rachel","31":": Oh God, I can�t believe you�re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!\"\n\"Ross","32":"Oh, really!\"\n\"Rachel","33":": Yeah.\"\n\"Ross","34":"Oh, really!\"\n\"Rachel","35":": Oh yeah.\"\n\"Ross","36":": What about the guy from the bar?\"\n\"Rachel","37":": What? Who?\"\n\"Ross","38":"The guy you gave your number to.\"\n\"Rachel","39":": Whoa, how do you know about that?\"\n\"Ross","40":"Because he called here looking for you. So don�t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,\"\n\"Rachel","41":": Why didn�t I get that message?\"\n\"Ross","42":"What?\"\n\"Rachel","43":": From the guy in the bar, why didn�t I get that message?\"\n\"Ross","44":"Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?\"\n\"Rachel","45":": Ross?\"\n\"Ross","46":"I never gave it to you.\"\n\"Rachel","47":": Why?\"\n\"Ross","48":"I don�t know.\"\n\"Rachel","49":": Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?\"\n\"Ross","50":"Who am I?\"\n\"Rachel","51":": Yes.\"\n\"Ross","52":"I am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars meeting guys!\"\n\"Rachel","53":": Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you\"\n\"Ross","54":"None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That�s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one\"\n\"Rachel","55":": Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What�s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they\"\n\"Ross","56":"Uh, clearly.\"\n\"Rachel","57":": And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,\"\n\"Ross","58":"Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?\"\n\"Joey","59":": Hey!\"\n\"Rachel","60":": Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?\"\n\"Joey","61":": Ha, oh, of course.\"\n\"Rachel","62":": Thank you.\"\n\"Joey","63":": Your eyebrows look weird.\"\n\"Chandler","64":": �Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped him\"\n\"Joey","65":"Morning, roomie!\"\n\"Rachel","66":"Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.\"\n\"Joey","67":"Fifth day's a charm.\"\n\"Rachel","68":"Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're      making it so easy on me and Emma.\"\n\"Joey","69":"Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want,      and when does she stop crying all night?\"\n\"Ross","70":"Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you      tonight?\"\n\"Rachel","71":"Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's      in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep,      so...\"\n\"Joey","72":"She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did      last night.\"\n\"Rachel","73":"Bye!\"\n\"Ross","74":"Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.\"\n\"Joey","75":"No, hey, it's been great.\"\n\"Ross","76":"Yeah?\"\n\"Joey","77":"Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying      here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?      And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using      a breast pump...\"\n\"Ross","78":"Yeah, that'll do it.\"\n\"Joey","79":"Wow! So, how are you?\"\n\"Ross","80":"I'm, I'm okay.\"\n\"Joey","81":"Really?\"\n\"Ross","82":"Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have      worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's      a divorce.\"\n\"Joey","83":"Well, actually it...\"\n\"Ross","84":"No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel      and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing      other people.\"\n\"Joey","85":"Wow, really?\"\n\"Ross","86":"Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good      for me...\"\n\"Joey","87":"Sure, I know lots of girls.\"\n\"Ross","88":"Yeah? Any names come to mind?\"\n\"Joey","89":"Ooh, names?\"\n\"Phoebe","90":"Hey.\"\n\"Joey","91":"Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?\"\n\"Phoebe","92":"What you got?\"\n\"Joey","93":"(checks the refrigerator): Okay, let's see, we got strained peas,      strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.\"\n\"Phoebe","94":"Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart      from the great food.\"\n\"Joey","95":"I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with      her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.\"\n\"Phoebe","96":"Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.\"\n\"Joey","97":"Why are they doing this?\"\n\"Phoebe","98":"I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.\"\n\"Joey","99":"You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in      here?\"\n\"Phoebe","100":"I just wish they'd realise they should be together.\"\n\"Joey","101":"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know,      that's where things were headed.\"\n\"Phoebe","102":"I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have      more children.\"\n\"Joey","103":"Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have      kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.\"\n\"Phoebe","104":"You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's      out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.\"\n\"Joey","105":"Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck!      But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.\"\n\"Phoebe","106":"So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them      up with people?\"\n\"Joey","107":"I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.\"\n\"Phoebe","108":"Yeah. (BEAT) Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel      up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.\"\n\"Joey","109":"Ooh, that's a great plan!\"\n\"Phoebe","110":"Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my \"plan-laugh.\" (A      maniacal laugh follows.)\"\n\"Joey","111":"Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...\"\n\"Rachel","112":"Hey!\"\n\"Monica","113":"Hey!\"\n\"Rachel","114":"You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?\"\n\"Chandler","115":"See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married?      I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll      excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.\"\n\"Rachel","116":"I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.\"\n\"Monica","117":"Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?\"\n\"Rachel","118":"Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.\"\n\"Monica","119":"Oh my god.\"\n\"Chandler","120":"Wow.\"\n\"Rachel","121":"Why? What's the big deal?\"\n\"Monica","122":"Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...\"\n\"Rachel","123":"What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.\"\n\"Chandler","124":"Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I      mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!\"\n\"Monica","125":"You want a job? Turn off \"Oprah,\" and send out a resume!\"\n\"Rachel","126":"So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?\"\n\"Monica","127":"Oh, it's perfect.\"\n\"Rachel","128":"Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age.      Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around      the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And      oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody      murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!\"\n\"Chandler","129":"(reading the newspaper): Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.\"\n\"Phoebe","130":"Ooh, Joey.\"\n\"Joey","131":"Hey.\"\n\"Phoebe","132":"Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.\"\n\"Joey","133":"All right! Who is he?\"\n\"Phoebe","134":"Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold      down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.\"\n\"Joey","135":"(gives a thumbs up sign): Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got      for Ross.\"\n\"Phoebe","136":"Oh, yeah.\"\n\"Joey","137":"She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!\"\n\"Phoebe","138":"A teacher?\"\n\"Joey","139":"Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh,      oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?\"\n\"Phoebe","140":"Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey,      you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!\"\n\"Joey","141":"Oh my god, you're right!\"\n\"Phoebe","142":"Yeah.\"\n\"Joey","143":"She even reads for pleasure!\"\n\"Phoebe","144":"How do you even know a woman like that?\"\n\"Joey","145":"What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?\"\n\"Phoebe","146":"Joey.\"\n\"Joey","147":"I met her at the library. I went in to pee.\"\n\"Phoebe","148":"So now what do we do?\"\n\"Joey","149":"Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled,      and find him somebody else.\"\n\"Phoebe","150":"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the      date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets      stood up!\"\n\"Joey","151":"Ooh...I hear that's bad.\"\n\"Phoebe","152":"Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross      gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.\"\n\"Joey","153":"Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like      Santa Claus.)\"\n\"Phoebe","154":"It's not Santa's plan. No, it's... (Laughs the real \"plan-laugh.\")\"\n\"Joey","155":"Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.\"\n\"Phoebe","156":"No, I think we killed it.\"\n\"Chandler","157":"Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.\"\n\"Chandler","158":"No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go.      Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!\"\n\"Monica","159":"Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until      the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.\"\n\"Chandler","160":"I don't do that.\"\n\"Chandler","161":"I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?\"\n\"Monica","162":"Yeah.\"\n\"Chandler","163":"Today is the sixth.\"\n\"Monica","164":"No, it's not.\"\n\"Chandler","165":"Yes, it's also 2003.\"\n\"Monica","166":"Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have      also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.\"\n\"Chandler","167":"It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.\"\n\"Monica","168":"Okay.\"\n\"Chandler","169":"Tough crib.\"\n\"Monica","170":"Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.\"\n\"Chandler","171":"I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.\"\n\"Monica","172":"Chandler!\"\n\"Chandler","173":"I am not working. There's not much to do around here!\"\n\"Ross","174":"Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height,      dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?\"\n\"Waiter","175":"Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.\"\n\"Ross","176":"Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.\"\n\"Waiter","177":"Can I get you another glass of wine?\"\n\"Ross","178":"Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home      alone.\"\n\"Waiter","179":"Got stood up, huh?\"\n\"Ross","180":"Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.\"\n\"Waiter","181":"Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?\"\n\"Ross","182":"No!\"\n\"Monica","183":"We're okay. I'm still ovulating.\"\n\"Chandler","184":"Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.\"\n\"Monica","185":"So, let's do this.\"\n\"Chandler","186":"I - I don't think I can.\"\n\"Monica","187":"Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.\"\n\"Chandler","188":"Because of Emma.\"\n\"Monica","189":"Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're      right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.\"\n\"Chandler","190":"Sorry.\"\n\"Monica","191":"Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware      of at this age?\"\n\"Chandler","192":"Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start...      canoodling in it.\"\n\"Monica","193":"Canoodling?\"\n\"Chandler","194":"Well, I can't say \"hump\" or \"screw\" in front      of the B-A-B-Y.\"\n\"Monica","195":"I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't      so...\"\n\"Chandler","196":"Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?\"\n\"Monica","197":"I guess you're right.\"\n\"Chandler","198":"You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you      wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through      the window.\"\n\"Monica","199":"But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?\"\n\"Rachel","200":"Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.\"\n\"Steve","201":"(staring at Rachel): I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful.\"\n\"Rachel","202":"Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.\"\n\"Steve","203":"I'm kind of funny looking.\"\n\"Rachel","204":"What?\"\n\"Steve","205":"Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows      it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, \"ooh, why she out with      him? He must be rich!\" Well, I'm not!\"\n\"Rachel","206":"(feeling awkward): So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really      excited about that chicken.\"\n\"Steve","207":"I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, \"well, he's      not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs\"... That ain't      gonna happen.\"\n\"Rachel","208":"Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now      wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant.      That's impressive.\"\n\"Steve","209":"I lost it. To drugs.\"\n\"Steve","210":"I silk-screen t-shirts now.\"\n\"Rachel","211":"Really? What's that like?\"\n\"Steve","212":"It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's      right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with      two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.\"\n\"Rachel","213":"(awkward chuckle): Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something      that you like about yourself.\"\n\"Steve","214":"I do like my hair.\"\n\"Rachel","215":"Really?\"\n\"Phoebe","216":"Hello?\"\n\"Rachel","217":"Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!\"\n\"Phoebe","218":"Hey, Rach!\"\n\"Rachel","219":"This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?\"\n\"Phoebe","220":"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.\"\n\"Rachel","221":"I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!\"\n\"Phoebe","222":"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.\"\n\"Rachel","223":"He's not stoned.\"\n\"Phoebe","224":"Did he go out for a cigarette?\"\n\"Rachel","225":"Yeah, four times.\"\n\"Phoebe","226":"My dear, sweet Rach.\"\n\"Phoebe","227":"(to Joey): Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable      time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.\"\n\"Joey","228":"Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.\"\n\"Phoebe","229":"By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny      Mexico. (BEAT) Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.\"\n\"Monica","230":"She's asleep. Chandler?\"\n\"Monica","231":"What are you doing?\"\n\"Chandler","232":"Emma was doing it!\"\n\"Monica","233":"She's asleep.\"\n\"Chandler","234":"Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...\"\n\"Monica","235":"Yes, but we have to be fast.\"\n\"Chandler","236":"(laughs): Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.\"\n\"Monica","237":"(laughs): Okay, I'll try.\"\n\"Joey","238":"Hello?\"\n\"Joey","239":"Emma? Hey! Hi!\"\n\"Joey","240":"How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the      bedroom door closed?\"\n\"Joey","241":"You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!\"\n\"Waiter","242":"I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.\"\n\"Ross","243":"Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.\"\n\"Waiter","244":"Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time.      Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on      the house.\"\n\"Ross","245":"Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to      have sex tonight.\"\n\"Waiter","246":"Ooh...\"\n\"Ross","247":"Just the crab cakes.\"\n\"Waiter #2","248":"What are you      doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that.\"\n\"Waiter","249":"Just get out of here, okay?\"\n\"Ross","250":"What's - what's going on?\"\n\"Waiter","251":"Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on      how long it'll take before you give up and go home.\"\n\"Ross","252":"What? You - you're making money off my misery?\"\n\"Waiter","253":"Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.\"\n\"Ross","254":"This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life.      Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.\"\n\"Monica","255":"Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.\"\n\"Chandler","256":"I think we may have really done it this time.\"\n\"Monica","257":"Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.\"\n\"Chandler","258":"You may wanna get some more of those too.\"\n\"Chandler","259":"Where's Emma?\"\n\"Monica","260":"Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?\"\n\"Chandler","261":"Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!\"\n\"Monica","262":"Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma.      You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.\"\n\"Chandler","263":"Okay. (Runs out.)\"\n\"Monica","264":"Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another,      we're giving a baby back to Rachel.\"\n\"Steve","265":"(sobbing): I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must      think I'm so pathetic.\"\n\"Rachel","266":"No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.\"\n\"Steve","267":"Really?\"\n\"Rachel","268":"Don't touch my coat!\"\n\"Rachel","269":"Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?\"\n\"Monica","270":"(on phone): Hey, Rach, how's it going?\"\n\"Rachel","271":"Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!\"\n\"Rachel","272":"(to Steve): Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think      that this was going well? (To Monica.) What's up?\"\n\"Monica","273":"Hey, did you stop by here?\"\n\"Rachel","274":"No.\"\n\"Monica","275":"Oh my god, then...\"\n\"Monica","276":"Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!\"\n\"Rachel","277":"What? What do you mean, \"there you are\"? Where was she?\"\n\"Monica","278":"Oh, we were playing \"peek-a-boo.\" She just � she loves      it when I'm dramatic.\"\n\"Monica","279":"(to Joey): Why the hell did you take her?\"\n\"Joey","280":"Because you two were having sex!\"\n\"Monica","281":"No, we weren't!\"\n\"Joey","282":"Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. (To Chandler.)      You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?\"\n\"Chandler","283":"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's      ovulating.\"\n\"Joey","284":"Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in      the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.\"\n\"Chandler","285":"No, no, no.\"\n\"Monica","286":"No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!\"\n\"Joey","287":"Hey, I gotta! Unless...\"\n\"Monica","288":"Unless what?\"\n\"Joey","289":"Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.\"\n\"Chandler","290":"What? Why?\"\n\"Joey","291":"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family      name.\"\n\"Chandler","292":"Your family name is Tribbiani.\"\n\"Joey","293":"(BEAT) (Laughs.) You almost had me.\"\n\"Rachel","294":"Well, uh...\"\n\"Steve","295":"Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you      like to make love to me?\"\n\"Rachel","296":"Really, really not.\"\n\"Steve","297":"Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway.\"\n\"Rachel","298":"All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.\"\n\"Ross","299":"Hey, what's wrong?\"\n\"Rachel","300":"I just had a rough night.\"\n\"Ross","301":"Oh. Crab cake?\"\n\"Rachel","302":"Eww!\"\n\"Ross","303":"Well, what happened?\"\n\"Rachel","304":"Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...\"\n\"Ross","305":"Monica told me you had a blind date.\"\n\"Rachel","306":"Yeah.\"\n\"Ross","307":"I did, too.\"\n\"Rachel","308":"Oh.\"\n\"Ross","309":"But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?\"\n\"Rachel","310":"Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?\"\n\"Ross","311":"Why does everyone keep saying that?\"\n\"Rachel","312":"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown      up.\"\n\"Ross","313":"That bad?\"\n\"Rachel","314":"Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be      appropriate to give me this.\"\n\"Ross","315":"Female body inspector? What size is that?\"\n\"Phoebe","316":"Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?\"\n\"Joey","317":"Uh-huh.\"\n\"Phoebe","318":"How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?\"\n\"Joey","319":"It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.\"\n\"Phoebe","320":"Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.\"\n\"Phoebe","321":"Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.\"\n\"Phoebe","322":"Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.\"\n\"Ross","323":"The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.\"\n\"Rachel","324":"Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would      set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you      up on a date that didn't even show.\"\n\"Ross","325":"Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's      just stupid.\"\n\"Joey","326":"We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really      bonding.\"\n\"Phoebe","327":"Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.\"\n\"Phoebe","328":"Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out.      They're coming this way. Run!\"\n\"Joey","329":"Where?\"\n\"Phoebe","330":"Mexico!\"\n\"Joey","331":"Can you believe they're still not here?\"\n\"Ross","332":"I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the      chances?\"\n\"Joey","333":"I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?\"\n\"Waiter","334":"What?\"\n\"Joey","335":"We've been stood up. (sniffles) And we want our free crab cakes.\"\n\"Waiter","336":"Guys, give it a rest. Nobody's betting on you tonight. Although we      do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.\"\n\"Steve","337":"I have such fat hands!\"\n\"Chandler","338":"Chandler\"\n\"Chandler","339":"Hey! Ready to go?\"\n\"Ross","340":"Oh yeah, let me just finish this.\"\n\"Joey","341":"Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!\"\n\"Chandler","342":"What are you doin'?\"\n\"Ross","343":"Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.\"\n\"Chandler","344":"Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .\"\n\"Ross","345":"It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?\"\n\"Chandler","346":"The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?\"\n\"Ross","347":"Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...\"\n\"Chandler","348":"Bet she'd sleep with you now...\"\n\"Ross","349":"No... I already e-mailed her.\"\n\"Chandler","350":"Let me see what you wrote about yourself: \"Doctor Paleontology, two kids... \" (pause) You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!\"\n\"Ross","351":"You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.\"\n\"Joey","352":"Hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)\"\n\"Ross","353":"(he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)\"\n\"Chandler","354":"Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on Ross' computer) \"Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had\"... aaand SEND!\"\n\"Joey","355":"(he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!\"\n\"Ross","356":"(he comes back) Alright, let's go!\"\n\"Joey","357":"Dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands)\"\n\"Ross","358":"I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!\"\n\"Joey","359":"(after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button)\"\n\"Rachel","360":"Hey! How was basketball?\"\n\"Joey","361":"Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!\"\n\"Rachel","362":"Oh, no! Who did that?\"\n\"Joey","363":"Chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near Emma's cot) Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? (he looks puzzled)\"\n\"Rachel","364":"She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?\"\n\"Joey","365":"(still very puzzled) Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!\"\n\"Rachel","366":"Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!\"\n\"Joey","367":"Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...\"\n\"Rachel","368":"All right... Oh, Emma loves him!\"\n\"Joey","369":"Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!\"\n\"Phoebe","370":"Hi.\"\n\"Monica","371":"Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?\"\n\"Phoebe","372":"Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!\"\n\"Chandler","373":"Oh, I'm so sorry!\"\n\"Phoebe","374":"Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...\"\n\"Chandler","375":"You're not gonna need my help?\"\n\"Phoebe","376":"Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.\"\n\"Chandler","377":"Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)\"\n\"Phoebe","378":"Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.\"\n\"Monica","379":"Ok, you got it!\"\n\"Phoebe","380":"(after a pause) Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.\"\n\"Monica","381":"Really? If that's what you want...\"\n\"Phoebe","382":"That was a test and you just failed.\"\n\"Monica","383":"Damn it! Rookie mistake!\"\n\"Ross","384":"(yelling at Chandler) I have sex with dinosaurs??\"\n\"Chandler","385":"I believe I read that somewhere!\"\n\"Ross","386":"That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  (pause) It's not funny!!\"\n\"Chandler","387":"I respectfully disagree.\"\n\"Ross","388":"I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!\"\n\"Chandler","389":"Who cares? Nobody reads those things\"\n\"Ross","390":"You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.\"\n\"Chandler","391":"I don't have a page.\"\n\"Ross","392":"Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!\"\n\"Joey","393":"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...  with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up Hugsy) It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)\"\n\"Rachel","394":"(threatening Joey with a scrunchy): Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!\"\n\"Joey","395":"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.\"\n\"Rachel","396":"What are you doing?\"\n\"Joey","397":"Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.\"\n\"Rachel","398":"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.\"\n\"Joey","399":"(placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie...  (to Emma) This isn't over.\"\n\"Monica","400":"Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  (reads from the screen) \"gay as the day is long\"?\"\n\"Chandler","401":"Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.\"\n\"Monica","402":"But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. (Phone rings)\"\n\"Chandler","403":"Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.\"\n\"Monica","404":"(On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.\"\n\"Chandler","405":"Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something).\"\n\"Monica","406":"What are you doing?\"\n\"Chandler","407":"Oh, you'll see my friend.\"\n\"Ross","408":"(visibly upset) I'm dead?\"\n\"Chandler","409":"(faking sympathy) And so young.\"\n\"Ross","410":"Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.\"\n\"Chandler","411":"Well, how you died was funny.\"\n\"Ross","412":"Oh please, hit by a blimp?\"\n\"Chandler","413":"It kills over one americans every year.\"\n\"Ross","414":"Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.\"\n\"Chandler","415":"You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!\"\n\"Ross","416":"You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.\"\n\"Phoebe","417":"God, I wish Mike were here.\"\n\"Monica","418":"Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?\"\n\"Monica","419":"What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!\"\n\"Phoebe","420":"I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.\"\n\"Monica","421":"Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone.\"\n\"Phoebe","422":"Here.\"\n\"Monica","423":"And now your cell.\"\n\"Phoebe","424":"Okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)\"\n\"Monica","425":"This is your cellphone?\"\n\"Phoebe","426":"Yes.\"\n\"Monica","427":"This is your current cellphone?\"\n\"Phoebe","428":"Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.\"\n\"Monica","429":"Phoebe, where's your purse?\"\n\"Monica","430":"No, no! Give it to me!\"\n\"Phoebe","431":"You can't have it.\"\n\"Monica","432":"Give it to me!\"\n\"Phoebe","433":"No (tucks it in her pants)\"\n\"Monica","434":"I'll go in there.\"\n\"Phoebe","435":"(disbelievingly) Oh yeah.\"\n\"Monica","436":"Phoebe come here\"\n\"Monica","437":"Haha!\"\n\"Phoebe","438":"Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!\"\n\"Joey","439":"Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.\"\n\"Rachel","440":"Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.\"\n\"Joey","441":"No, no, it's not a girl, it's...  a brand new Hugsy!\"\n\"Rachel","442":"Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.\"\n\"Joey","443":"No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.\"\n\"Rachel","444":"Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...\"\n\"Joey","445":"Make the transfer! (She does so)\"\n\"Rachel","446":"Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?\"\n\"Joey","447":"Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.\"\n\"Rachel","448":"Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.\"\n\"Joey","449":"But he's the same.\"\n\"Rachel","450":"Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.\"\n\"Joey","451":"But he's the same.\"\n\"Rachel","452":"Joey, come on!\"\n\"Joey","453":"He's the same!\"\n\"Joey","454":"(to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!\"\n\"Monica","455":"Haha!\"\n\"Phoebe","456":"You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.\"\n\"Monica","457":"So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.\"\n\"Phoebe","458":"Those are my shoes.\"\n\"Monica","459":"Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.\"\n\"Phoebe","460":"Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.\"\n\"Monica","461":"Who's that? (goes to open door)\"\n\"Phoebe","462":"I ordered Chinese food.\"\n\"Phoebe","463":"What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?\"\n\"Monica","464":"(To Mike) What are you doing here?\"\n\"Mike","465":"Phoebe called me.\"\n\"Monica","466":"Phoebe!\"\n\"Phoebe","467":"I'm sorry, I broke down...  I wanted to see him.\"\n\"Monica","468":"Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?\"\n\"Phoebe","469":"There is a speakerphone on the base unit...\"\n\"Monica","470":"Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!\"\n\"Mike","471":"Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...\"\n\"Monica","472":"(to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!\"\n\"Mike","473":"Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!\"\n\"Monica","474":"Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.\"\n\"Phoebe","475":"Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?\"\n\"Monica","476":"Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical).\"\n\"Phoebe","477":"Sit down.\"\n\"Monica","478":"Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)\"\n\"Mike","479":"(to Phoebe) So how've you been?\"\n\"Monica","480":"I've been pretty good!\"\n\"Mike","481":"(to Phoebe) You look really beautiful.\"\n\"Phoebe","482":"Thanks, you look good too.\"\n\"Monica","483":"Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!\"\n\"Phoebe","484":"So how's the piano playing going?\"\n\"Mike","485":"Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.\"\n\"Phoebe","486":"I've missed you too.\"\n\"Monica","487":"You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!\"\n\"Chandler","488":"Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?\"\n\"Ross","489":"uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)\"\n\"Chandler","490":"Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?\"\n\"Ross","491":"Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little \"Ross is dead\" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?\"\n\"Chandler","492":"No, come on, you know that's not true.\"\n\"Ross","493":"What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!\"\n\"Chandler","494":"Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.\"\n\"Ross","495":"I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)\"\n\"Chandler","496":"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.\"\n\"Ross","497":"You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.\"\n\"Chandler","498":"Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.\"\n\"Ross","499":"Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)\"\n\"Chandler","500":"Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?\"\n\"Ross","501":"No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!\"\n\"Chandler","502":"Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !\"\n\"Ross","503":"oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...\"\n\"Rachel","504":"I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?\"\n\"Joey","505":"Original or crappy?\"\n\"Rachel","506":"Original.\"\n\"Joey","507":"No, sorry haven't seen him.\"\n\"Rachel","508":"Then what's that big lump under your covers?\"\n\"Joey","509":"It's Monica, ok?\"\n\"Rachel","510":"That's not Monica!\"\n\"Joey","511":"Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..\"\n\"Rachel","512":"(to herself) Oh God.\"\n\"Joey","513":"... she's being unreasonable!\"\n\"Rachel","514":"(yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!\"\n\"Joey","515":"It does?\"\n\"Rachel","516":"Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.\"\n\"Joey","517":"Really? She... she loves me?\"\n\"Rachel","518":"Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room).\"\n\"Joey","519":"Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then...  well she can have him.\"\n\"Rachel","520":"Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!\"\n\"Joey","521":"Look forget it forget it...  I can't do it.\"\n\"Rachel","522":"Are you gonna...  you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?\"\n\"Joey","523":"How do you think I got him in the first place?\"\n\"Monica","524":"Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.\"\n\"Mike","525":"I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.\"\n\"Phoebe","526":"I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?\"\n\"Mike","527":"It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time...  I never would have stopped.\"\n\"Monica","528":"(running back into the room) Kiss him, you fool!!\"\n\"Phoebe","529":"What?\"\n\"Monica","530":"Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!\"\n\"Phoebe","531":"Oh, I missed you so much! (she kisses Mike)\"\n\"Strange man","532":"(he bounds into the house) I knew you'd be here!\"\n\"Mike","533":"Oh, crap!\"\n\"Phoebe","534":"Who is this?\"\n\"Mike","535":"My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.\"\n\"Monica","536":"Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!\"\n\"Manny","537":"Well, you are not doing a very good job!\"\n\"Monica","538":"Excuse me?\"\n\"Manny","539":"What's with the kissing?\"\n\"Monica","540":"Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.\"\n\"Manny","541":"Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!\"\n\"Monica","542":"You didn't hear the speech!\"\n\"Manny","543":"I've heard the speech: (in a mocking voice) \"if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... \"\n\"Monica","544":"Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!\"\n\"Manny","545":"You're weak!\"\n\"Monica","546":"You're... weird!\"\n\"Manny","547":"Your pants are undone!\"\n\"Monica","548":"Oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!\"\n\"Manny","549":"(looking at the sofa) Where did they go?\"\n\"Monica","550":"Damn it!\"\n\"Manny","551":"Oh we blew it. I blame myself.\"\n\"Monica","552":"And I blame you too.\"\n\"Ross","553":"It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!\"\n\"Chandler","554":"There you go! Someone came!\"\n\"Ross","555":"Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)\"\n\"Monica","556":"Hi, glad you could come.\"\n\"Chandler","557":"(in a mournful voice) Please, come in.\"\n\"Tom","558":"Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.\"\n\"Chandler","559":"Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.\"\n\"Tom","560":"Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...\"\n\"Chandler","561":"At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)\"\n\"Ross","562":"Who is he?\"\n\"Chandler","563":"Some guy, Tom Gordon.\"\n\"Ross","564":"I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)\"\n\"Monica","565":"So, did you know Ross well?\"\n\"Tom","566":"Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?\"\n\"Monica","567":"(a bit surprised) Yes, he is. Me.\"\n\"Tom","568":"What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?\"\n\"Chandler","569":"(entering, very upset) Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)\"\n\"Tom","570":"(before leaving) Hey, listen. Call me.\"\n\"Chandler","571":"Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)\"\n\"Ross","572":"(coming in) I'm dead and no one cares?\"\n\"Monica","573":"I look like a man??\"\n\"Chandler","574":"Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!\"\n\"Ross","575":"It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!\"\n\"Chandler","576":"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!\"\n\"Ross","577":"Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?\"\n\"Chandler","578":"Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?\"\n\"Ross","579":"(sceptical) Yeah...\"\n\"Chandler","580":"I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)\"\n\"Kori","581":"Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.\"\n\"Chandler","582":"Kori? Kori Weston?\"\n\"Kori","583":"Yeah...\"\n\"Chandler","584":"Wow! You look amazing!\"\n\"Kori","585":"And you are...\"\n\"Chandler","586":"Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.\"\n\"Monica","587":"You are married though.\"\n\"Chandler","588":"Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)\"\n\"Kori","589":"I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.\"\n\"Chandler","590":"I didn't know Ross and you were so close.\"\n\"Kori","591":"We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.\"\n\"Chandler","592":"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.\"\n\"Kori","593":"I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.\"\n\"Ross","594":"(he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!\"\n\"Kori","595":"You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you! (she leaves and slams the door behind her)\"\n\"Ross","596":"Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!\"\n\"Ross","597":"(on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?\"\n\"Joey","598":"Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?\"\n\"Monica","599":"Ok.\"\n\"Joey","600":"Alright!\"\n\"Monica","601":"But ehm...what is it not?\"\n\"Joey","602":"(abashed) A place to entertain my lady friends.\"\n\"Monica","603":"And what else is it not?\"\n\"Joey","604":"(even more abashed) A place to eat spaghetti.\"\n\"Monica","605":"Very good! (Gives him the keys) What do you need itfor anyway?\"\n\"Joey","606":"Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million andthey don't sell tickets here in New York, so...\"\n\"Rachel","607":"Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?\"\n\"Joey","608":"(hesitates for a moment)Yeah Connecticut...Not WestVirginia.\"\n\"Monica","609":"Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buysome tickets myself!\"\n\"Joey","610":"Uh!\"\n\"Monica","611":"Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could reallyuse 300 million dollars.\"\n\"Chandler","612":"Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300million? No thank you!\"\n\"Phoebe","613":"Hey will you get me tickets too?\"\n\"Rachel","614":"Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we allpitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win,we'll split it!\"\n\"Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross","615":"yeah thats a greatidea!\"\n\"Ross","616":"No thanks!\"\n\"Phoebe","617":"You don't wanna win the lottery?\"\n\"Ross","618":"(in a  mocking voice)Uh...sure I do, and I also wannabe King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.\"\n\"Chandler","619":"Still on Amelia Earhart?\"\n\"Ross","620":"The woman just vanished!\"\n\"Joey","621":"Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?\"\n\"Ross","622":"No! Do you know what your odds are of winning thelottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck bylightning 42 times.\"\n\"Chandler","623":"Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to getstruck by lightning 7 times.\"\n\"Joey","624":"I like those odds!\"\n\"Ross","625":"Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going tospend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.\"\n\"Chandler","626":"(looking around at the others)I'll ask. (To Ross)Boohaki?\"\n\"Ross","627":"Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we'retrying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.\"\n\"Rachel","628":"Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki,goshdarnit and brotherpucker.\"\n\"Monica","629":"How do you know she's gonna start talking?\"\n\"Rachel","630":"Well when I talk to her I almost feel like sheunderstands what I'm saying.\"\n\"Chandler","631":"Kinda like Joey.\"\n\"Joey","632":"(who wasn't paying attention)What's that now?\"\n\"Monica","633":"God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! Youknow I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.\"\n\"Chandler","634":"Pie eating contest?\"\n\"Monica","635":"Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only wayI could win something?\"\n\"Chandler","636":"No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.\"\n\"Monica","637":"(smiling)That was a good day!\"\n\"Ross","638":"(yelling to Monica)They're towing your car, they'retowing your car!!\"\n\"Monica","639":"I'm parked in a garage on Morton!\"\n\"Ross","640":"(panting)They're towing\"\n\"Joey","641":"(sounding panicky)Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma!And Rachel you don't have Emma! (Starts yelling) Where's Emma? Who hasEmma!?\"\n\"Rachel","642":"Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. Youwere there!\"\n\"Joey","643":"(not yelling anymore)I was?\"\n\"Racel","644":"Yes and you talked to her...\"\n\"Joey","645":"I did?\"\n\"Rachel","646":"She dropped off a casserole?\"\n\"Joey","647":"Oh yeah! The casserole lady.\"\n\"Monica","648":"(to Ross)So, did you come by to watch us win the bigbucks?\"\n\"Ross","649":"Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we couldall go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancingon top of it!\"\n\"Chandler","650":"(hysterical)Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'llget it, I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)\"\n\"Ross","651":"(to Monica)Think he washed his hands?\"\n\"Chandler","652":"(into receiver)Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?\"\n\"Rachel","653":"(to Monica)What's going on?\"\n\"Monica","654":"Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting anassistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they areonly hiring three.\"\n\"Joey","655":"Ooh! Tough odds!\"\n\"Ross","656":"(mockingly)Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your24 state lottery!\"\n\"Joey","657":"(smiling)Look who's coming around!\"\n\"Chandler","658":"(still on the phone)Damnit.

Guys! Give someoneelse a chance!\"\n\"Monica","670":"Alright, who wants to do it?\"\n\"Phoebe","671":"Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.It's really not fair either!

(rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot) Ah!! That thinggets hot!!\"\n\"Rachel","686":"You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How areyou gonna feel if we actually do win?\"\n\"Ross","687":"Uh, you're not gonna win.\"\n\"Rachel","688":"Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, butsomebody has to win, and it could be us!

Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.\"\n\"Rachel","1050":"Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.\"\n\"Monica","1051":"Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?\"\n\"Rachel","1052":"Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.\"\n\"Monica","1053":"What do you think brought than on?\"\n\"Rachel","1054":"I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.\"\n\"Monica","1055":"A love scene? With who?\"\n\"Rachel","1056":"Olivia.\"\n\"Monica","1057":"Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important.\"\n\"Rachel","1058":"So do you think that my dream means anything?\"\n\"Monica","1059":"I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.\"\n\"Rachel","1060":"Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...\"\n\"Monica","1061":"Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.\"\n\"Rachel","1062":"You took the same class twice.\"\n\"Monica","1063":"It was hard!\"\n\"Phoebe","1064":"Hey!\"\n\"Rachel and Monica","1065":"Hi.\"\n\"Phoebe","1066":"Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.\"\n\"Monica","1067":"Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.\"\n\"Phoebe","1068":"Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.\"\n\"Monica","1069":"Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.\"\n\"Phoebe","1070":"Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).\"\n\"Rachel","1071":"Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...\"\n\"Phoebe","1072":"My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?\"\n\"Rachel","1073":"Ok, we're still on that.\"\n\"Monica","1074":"I didn't say your songs were not good enough.\"\n\"Phoebe","1075":"Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?\"\n\"Monica","1076":"Tiny portions?\"\n\"Phoebe","1077":"Yeah well, \"excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it\"!\"\n\"Monica","1078":"Phoebe, it's not about quantity.\"\n\"Phoebe","1079":"Well...it's not about quality.\"\n\"Monica","1080":"Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.\"\n\"Phoebe","1081":"Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.\"\n\"Monica","1082":"Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.\"\n\"Phoebe","1083":"Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?\"\n\"Monica","1084":"You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.\"\n\"Phoebe","1085":"What are people having, the garlic Martini?\"\n\"Receptionist","1086":"Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.\"\n\"Chandler","1087":"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.\"\n\"Chandler","1088":"Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.\"\n\"Ross","1089":"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.\"\n\"Ross","1090":"Oh my god.\"\n\"Chandler","1091":"What?\"\n\"Ross","1092":"There's something new in the bowl.\"\n\"Chandler","1093":"Look, we have enough, just walk away.\"\n\"Ross","1094":"No, but I want...I want the pinecones!\"\n\"Chandler","1095":"There's a forest right outside.\"\n\"Ross","1096":"It's not the same.\"\n\"Chandler","1097":"Ok, go quick!\"\n\"Ross","1098":"(to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay.\"\n\"Ross","1099":"Oh, my maple candy!\"\n\"Phoebe","1100":"(singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..\"\n\"Monica","1101":"Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.\"\n\"Phoebe","1102":"You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.\"\n\"Monica","1103":"Ok, you have to stop playing now.\"\n\"Phoebe","1104":"Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!\"\n\"Monica","1105":"Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!\"\n\"Phoebe","1106":"(while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!\"\n\"Monica","1107":"(to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)\"\n\"Phoebe","1108":"Ok, ok, how many of you\"\n\"Monica","1109":"Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again).\"\n\"Phoebe","1110":"Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?\"\n\"Monica","1111":"Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)\"\n\"Phoebe","1112":"Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).\"\n\"Monica","1113":"Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand)\"\n\"Phoebe","1114":"Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)\"\n\"Monica","1115":"I'm sorry...\"\n\"Phoebe","1116":"I'm sorry too... (they hug)\"\n\"Monica","1117":"ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?\"\n\"Phoebe","1118":"Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...\"\n\"Phoebe","1119":"(smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?\"\n\"Rachel","1120":"Hey!\"\n\"Joey","1121":"Hey!\"\n\"Rachel","1122":"Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?\"\n\"Joey","1123":"(Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all!\"\n\"Rachel","1124":"(looks puzzled) How...how...?\"\n\"Joey","1125":"I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?\"\n\"Rachel","1126":"uh-huh\"\n\"Joey","1127":"And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!\"\n\"Rachel","1128":"(to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake...\"\n\"Joey","1129":"What?\"\n\"Rachel","1130":"What...how is it going with Drake?\"\n\"Joey","1131":"Oh...I don't think it's going very well...\"\n\"Rachel","1132":"What...that scene I saw was so good!\"\n\"Joey","1133":"Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...\"\n\"Rachel","1134":"Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?\"\n\"Joey","1135":"A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.\"\n\"Rachel","1136":"So?\"\n\"Joey","1137":"So...I've never played that!\"\n\"Rachel","1138":"Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?\"\n\"Joey","1139":"Uh...well...just once...with you...\"\n\"Rachel","1140":"Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?\"\n\"Joey","1141":"(looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about??\"\n\"Rachel","1142":"(shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.\"\n\"Joey","1143":"(approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.\"\n\"Rachel","1144":"(looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...\"\n\"Joey","1145":"Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.\"\n\"Joey","1146":"(excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)\"\n\"Chandler","1147":"I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table)\"\n\"Monica","1148":"(without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty!\"\n\"Ross","1149":"(sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?\"\n\"Joey","1150":"(enters the room) Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?\"\n\"Chandler","1151":"(browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.\"\n\"Joey","1152":"Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.\"\n\"Chandler","1153":"I could fall asleep at a play.\"\n\"Phoebe","1154":"What is it?\"\n\"Joey","1155":"It's a one-woman play called \"Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life\".\"\n\"Monica","1156":"It sounds interesting!\"\n\"Ross","1157":"Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett... (Ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep)\"\n\"Phoebe","1158":"I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?\"\n\"Joey","1159":"You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!\"\n\"Ross","1160":"What?

Oops, sorry.\"\n\"Joey","1164":"(lifts Rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) Hey, here you go.\"\n\"Rachel","1165":"Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?\"\n\"Monica","1166":"Yeah.\"\n\"Rachel","1167":"Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?\"\n\"Monica","1168":"No, I don't think it ever works. Why?\"\n\"Rachel","1169":"No reason.\"\n\"Monica","1170":"No, no, Rachel?\"\n\"Rachel","1171":"Yeah\"\n\"Monica","1172":"Who do you wanna fool around with?\"\n\"Rachel","1173":"(with high pitched voice) Nobody, forget it!\"\n\"Rachel","1174":"(giggling and whispering) Maybe.\"\n\"Monica","1175":"(whispering) You can't!\"\n\"Rachel","1176":"(whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with \"because\") Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.\"\n\"Monica","1177":"In the hall.\"\n\"Monica","1178":"You wanna fool around with Joey?\"\n\"Rachel","1179":"Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!\"\n\"Monica","1180":"Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?\"\n\"Rachel","1181":"Ok, off the top of my head...

(realizing how she's behaving) And it's out of my system!\"\n\"Professor Spafford","1249":"(speaking very slowly) And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.\"\n\"Ross","1250":"(very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?\"\n\"Professor Spafford","1251":"And that's not all I'm allergic to.\"\n\"Ross","1252":"(to Charlie) Oh, it's not over!\"\n\"Professor Spafford","1253":"I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...\"\n\"Ross","1254":"So basically all nuts?\"\n\"Professor Spafford","1255":"Interestingly... no.\"\n\"Charlie","1256":"Kinda playing fast and loose with the word \"interesting\".\"\n\"Professor Spafford","1257":"If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom. (he goes away)\"\n\"Charlie","1258":"Oh my God!!\"\n\"Ross","1259":"I've lost the will to live.\"\n\"Charlie","1260":"Let's ditch him!\"\n\"Ross","1261":"What?\"\n\"Charlie","1262":"Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!\"\n\"Ross","1263":"Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...\"\n\"Charlie","1264":"Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!! (they run outside)\"\n\"Ross","1265":"(entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.\"\n\"Phoebe","1266":"Hi!\"\n\"Ross","1267":"Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.\"\n\"Phoebe","1268":"Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?\"\n\"Charlie","1269":"Well, I think he's a little out there, but he\"\n\"Phoebe","1270":"Ah, ah.\"\n\"Charlie","1271":"(her mobile phone rings) Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. (she cuts herself off for a moment)\"\n\"Ross","1272":"(to Phoebe) Ranion's theory of species variegation?\"\n\"Phoebe","1273":"Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!\"\n\"Monica","1274":"(to Ross) So, did you two have fun?\"\n\"Ross","1275":"Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...\"\n\"Monica","1276":"And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud)\"\n\"Rachel","1277":"(she enters wearing a bath-robe) Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.\"\n\"Ross","1278":"Really? Wh-what's wrong?\"\n\"Rachel","1279":"I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!\"\n\"Charlie","1280":"Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.\"\n\"Rachel","1281":"... Ok, who is this?\"\n\"Ross","1282":"I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.\"\n\"Rachel","1283":"Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!\"\n\"Monica","1284":"Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?\"\n\"Rachel","1285":"Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh...\"\n\"Monica","1286":"You're not sick!\"\n\"Rachel","1287":"What? Yes, I am!\"\n\"Monica","1288":"Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??\"\n\"Rachel","1289":"When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)\"\n\"Monica","1290":"You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!\"\n\"Rachel","1291":"Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!\"\n\"Monica","1292":"Ok, what is this?\"\n\"Rachel","1293":"Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!\"\n\"Monica","1294":"(aloud) WHAT?\"\n\"Ross","1295":"(looking at them) Wh-what's going on?\"\n\"Monica","1296":"Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!\"\n\"Rachel","1297":"And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!\"\n\"Charlie","1298":"I thought you came to say you were sick.\"\n\"Rachel","1299":"Ok professor or detective?\"\n\"Phoebe","1300":"Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?\"\n\"Rachel","1301":"Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that\"\n\"Phoebe","1302":"And that horrible museum tour!\"\n\"Ross","1303":"No, I arranged that...\"\n\"Joey","1304":"(sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.\"\n\"Phoebe","1305":"We know about your party Joey.\"\n\"Joey","1306":"What party?\"\n\"Monica","1307":"The game's over! Take off your robe!\"\n\"Joey","1308":"(looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean...\"\n\"Everyone","1309":"No!! Cover it up!!\"\n\"Joey","1310":"(to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves)\"\n\"Joey","1311":"(To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming.\"\n\"Monica","1312":"Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!\"\n\"Kyle Lowder","1313":"(to Monica) Hi. (walks on)\"\n\"Monica","1314":"(Yells after him) I love you!\"\n\"Joey","1315":"Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...\"\n\"Monica","1316":"Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.\"\n\"Phoebe","1317":"Hey!\"\n\"Monica","1318":"(Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.\"\n\"Phoebe","1319":"Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where\"\n\"Monica","1320":"(Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler!\"\n\"Chandler","1321":"Where the hell\"\n\"Bitter lady","1322":"(yelling) Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.\"\n\"Monica","1323":"(to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this \"best wishes\" crap. I want \"love\".\"\n\"Rachel","1324":"Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.\"\n\"Monica","1325":"Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!\"\n\"Matthew Ashford","1326":"It was nice to meet you Rachel.\"\n\"Rachel","1327":"Nice to meet you.\"\n\"Matthew Ashford","1328":"Call me.\"\n\"Rachel","1329":"Ok\"\n\"Monica","1330":"(yelling after him) We will!!\"\n\"Monica","1331":"(to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys!\"\n\"Rachel","1332":"Yeah!\"\n\"Monica","1333":"I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?\"\n\"Rachel","1334":"Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!\"\n\"Monica","1335":"Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather)\"\n\"Ross","1336":"(to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?\"\n\"Charlie","1337":"Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.\"\n\"Ross","1338":"Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?\"\n\"Charlie","1339":"Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.\"\n\"Ross","1340":"You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?\"\n\"Charlie","1341":"Yeah...\"\n\"Ross","1342":"... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...\"\n\"Charlie","1343":"Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.\"\n\"Ross","1344":"Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!\"\n\"Charlie","1345":"Yes! And while that\"\n\"Ross","1346":"(very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch \"Access Hollywood\".\"\n\"Charlie","1347":"Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was\"\n\"Ross","1348":"Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?\"\n\"Charlie","1349":"A guy who won two.\"\n\"Ross","1350":"(a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart\"\n\"Charlie","1351":"Yeah... for three years.\"\n\"Ross","1352":"Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who\"\n\"Charlie","1353":"(smiling and thinks for a moment)... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.\"\n\"Ross","1354":"Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?\"\n\"Charlie","1355":"No, but he\"\n\"Ross","1356":"Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)\"\n\"Phoebe","1357":"Hey Ross!\"\n\"Rache","1358":"How is it going with Charlie?\"\n\"Ross","1359":"(sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.\"\n\"Phoebe","1360":"Oh, What's the matter?\"\n\"Ross","1361":"She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.\"\n\"Rachel","1362":"I always loved that!!\"\n\"Ross","1363":"Of course\"\n\"Phoebe","1364":"Worse?\"\n\"Ross","1365":"Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) \"Can we walk\"? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that?\"\n\"Phoebe","1366":"(still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)\"\n\"Ross","1367":"What? (turns around to look at Rachel)\"\n\"Rachel","1368":"Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves)\"\n\"Bitter lady","1369":"Well, I bet you are all thinkin' \"Now would be a really great time for an intermission\", huh?\"\n\"Chandler","1370":"(To himself) oh yes, God yes!!\"\n\"Bitter lady","1371":"(now yelling) Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. (Now standing right in front of Chandler and bending down almost to his level as if speaking to him, yelling even louder)\"\n\"Chandler","1372":"I... I don't know... you seem lovely.\"\n\"Joey","1373":"Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)\"\n\"Ross","1374":"Nice to meet you.\"\n\"Dirk","1375":"Hey! So what show are you on?\"\n\"Ross","1376":"Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.\"\n\"Joey","1377":"It's a science.\"\n\"Dirk","1378":"Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on \"Days\". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.\"\n\"Joey","1379":"Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...\"\n\"Ross","1380":"Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.\"\n\"Dirk","1381":"Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.\"\n\"Ross","1382":"I'd lead with that.\"\n\"Monica","1383":"That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so).\"\n\"Joey","1384":"Monica!\"\n\"Monica","1385":"Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!\"\n\"Joey","1386":"(To Rachel) What have you got there?\"\n\"Ross","1387":"Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.\"\n\"Joey","1388":"Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?\"\n\"Rachel","1389":"(drunken voice) I think I am.\"\n\"Joey","1390":"(browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.\"\n\"Joey","1391":"(discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...\"\n\"Rachel","1392":"(picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with\"\n\"Joey","1393":"Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.\"\n\"Rachel","1394":"Joey, you're so sweet.\"\n\"Joey","1395":"That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.\"\n\"Rachel","1396":"Who (looks around)?\"\n\"Joey","1397":"Me.\"\n\"Rachel","1398":"(surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really?\"\n\"Joey","1399":"Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!\"\n\"Rachel","1400":"Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five)\"\n\"Joey","1401":"Gotcha.\"\n\"Rachel","1402":"Oh, Very funny... Joey.\"\n\"Chandler","1403":"(to Monica) So, how did\"\n\"Monica","1404":"Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.\"\n\"Chandler","1405":"Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.\"\n\"Monica","1406":"You really liked it?\"\n\"Chandler","1407":"Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone)\"\n\"Monica","1408":"Oh really!\"\n\"Chandler","1409":"Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!\"\n\"Monica","1410":"No!\"\n\"Chandler","1411":"Did somebody sign your bra?\"\n\"Monica","1412":"So I got it when I was 13...\"\n\"Phoebe","1413":"Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?\"\n\"Ross","1414":"It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.\"\n\"Phoebe","1415":"Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.\"\n\"Ross","1416":"Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.\"\n\"Phoebe","1417":"You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...\"\n\"Ross","1418":"And sexy.\"\n\"Phoebe","1419":"Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!\"\n\"Ross","1420":"Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.\"\n\"Phoebe","1421":"Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!\"\n\"Ross","1422":"Stop going through my stuff (walks away)!\"\n\"Rachel","1423":"(to Monica) Hey!\"\n\"Monica","1424":"Hey!\"\n\"Rachel","1425":"I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.\"\n\"Monica","1426":"No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.\"\n\"Rachel","1427":"Please, what about you and Chandler?\"\n\"Monica","1428":"That's different! I was drunk and stupid!\"\n\"Rachel","1429":"Well hello (points to herself)!\"\n\"Monica","1430":"What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?\"\n\"Rachel","1431":"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!\"\n\"Monica","1432":"Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.\"\n\"Rachel","1433":"(pause) I'm gonna do it.\"\n\"Monica","1434":"And I can't stop you.\"\n\"Rachel","1435":"No.\"\n\"Ross","1436":"(to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?\"\n\"Ross","1437":"I'm smarter than\"\n\"Phoebe","1438":"Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.\"\n\"Chandler","1439":"Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.\"\n\"Monica","1440":"Oh, you're so wonderful.\"\n\"Bitter woman","1441":"Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.\"\n\"Chandler","1442":"Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away).\"\n\"Monica","1443":"It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?   I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.\"\n\"Ross","1444":"Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But\"\n\"Chandler","1445":"I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?\"\n\"Ross","1446":"Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did\"\n\"Rachel","1447":"I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls   at the party, GOD!\"\n\"Ross","1448":"Why do you care so much?\"\n\"Monica","1449":"Yes Rachel, why\"\n\"Rachel","1450":"(worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know...   and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying   is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.\"\n\"Ross","1451":"Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each   other's tonsils...\"\n\"Phoebe","1452":"Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids   and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh,   those nerds will get\"\n\"Rachel","1453":"All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...\"\n\"Ross","1454":"Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with   it...\"\n\"Ross","1455":"Oh, God. I forgot how\"\n\"Joey","1456":"Hey!\"\n\"All","1457":"Hi!\"\n\"Ross","1458":"I'm gonna get some more coffee.\"\n\"Charlie","1459":"Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!\"\n\"Ross","1460":"Ok. (they both go)\"\n\"Chandler","1461":"(to Joey) So, a professor, uh?\"\n\"Joey","1462":"Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious   (which, being Joey, he mispronounces \"amonious\"). (pause) That's not   how she used it...?\"\n\"Charlie","1463":"(talking to Ross) I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't   ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed.   I really hope you don't think less of me.\"\n\"Ross","1464":"Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean,   you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like   someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.\"\n\"Charlie","1465":"You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean,   Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors,   and intellectuals, and\"\n\"Ross","1466":"Yeah, I know the type.\"\n\"Joey","1467":"Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious.   No? Am I getting close?\"\n\"Phoebe","1468":"(entering) Hey!\"\n\"Monica","1469":"Hey!\"\n\"Phoebe","1470":"Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of   slippers)\"\n\"Rachel","1471":"Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?\"\n\"Phoebe","1472":"I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania   Twain.\"\n\"Rachel","1473":"(after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!\"\n\"Phoebe","1474":"Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)\"\n\"Monica","1475":"Hey, what's this?\"\n\"Rachel","1476":"Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.\"\n\"Monica","1477":"Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage   chains.\"\n\"Rachel","1478":"Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things   that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...\"\n\"Monica","1479":"Do you wanna go hunting?\"\n\"Rachel","1480":"Well, I would like to have the option!!\"\n\"Phoebe","1481":"(coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift   certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!\"\n\"Rachel","1482":"Oh!\"\n\"Phoebe","1483":"No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these \"big   massage places\"! They're putting people like me out of business!\"\n\"Monica","1484":"And she wants to go hunting, too!!\"\n\"Rachel","1485":"Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing   away a hundred bucks!\"\n\"Phoebe","1486":"Ok, this is not about the\"\n\"Rachel","1487":"I don't care about any of that!!\"\n\"Phoebe","1488":"Well, do you care about friendship?\"\n\"Rachel","1489":"Oh!\"\n\"Phoebe","1490":"I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use   this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.\"\n\"Rachel","1491":"Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!\"\n\"Phoebe","1492":"Promise?\"\n\"Rachel","1493":"I promise.\"\n\"Phoebe","1494":"Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)\"\n\"Rachel","1495":"But I am going hunting!!\"\n\"Monica","1496":"(entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!\"\n\"Chandler","1497":"Oh, yeah?\"\n\"Monica","1498":"Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight?\"\n\"Chandler","1499":"Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the   table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)\"\n\"Monica","1500":"Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience!   Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need   to keep your tadpoles in the tank.\"\n\"Chandler","1501":"We really need to take those tests?\"\n\"Monica","1502":"Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think   it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.\"\n\"Chandler","1503":"But I don't wanna do it in a cup!\"\n\"Monica","1504":"What is the big deal?\"\n\"Chandler","1505":"It's weird! In a doctor's office?\"\n\"Monica","1506":"It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do   it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?\"\n\"Chandler","1507":"(embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause)   And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!\"\n\"Monica","1508":"Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think   it's a good idea!\"\n\"Chandler","1509":"Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than   on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!\"\n\"Monica","1510":"(really embarrassed) OH!\"\n\"Chandler","1511":"Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!\"\n\"Joey","1512":"(sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost   more than milk!\"\n\"Joey","1513":"Heeey!\"\n\"Charlie","1514":"Hi!\"\n\"Joey","1515":"Come on in, how are ya?\"\n\"Charlie","1516":"I'm good!\"\n\"Joey","1517":"Can I offer you a drink?\"\n\"Joey","1518":"Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to   open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!\"\n\"Charlie","1519":"So I am just so excited to be   here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!\"\n\"Joey","1520":"Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)\"\n\"Charlie","1521":"Oh, you mean it? That would be so\"\n\"Joey","1522":"Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?\"\n\"Charlie","1523":"Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher   Hall.\"\n\"Joey","1524":"(looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!\"\n\"Charlie","1525":"And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display   at the public library.\"\n\"Joey","1526":"I know, yeah!\"\n\"Charlie","1527":"And first, I have to see the MET!\"\n\"Joey","1528":"Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna   see the Yankees.\"\n\"Charlie","1529":"No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!\"\n\"Joey","1530":"Which one, they all suck!\"\n\"Charlie","1531":"The museum!\"\n\"Joey","1532":"(looking puzzled) I don't think so.\"\n\"Rachel","1533":"(to the receptionist) Hi there!\"\n\"Receptionist","1534":"(in an affected tone) Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa   SPA. How may I help you?\"\n\"Rachel","1535":"Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and   here is my gift certificate.\"\n\"Receptionist","1536":"This has been torn up.\"\n\"Rachel","1537":"And... taped back together.\"\n\"Receptionist","1538":"Ok well, I'll call you as   soon as your massage therapist is ready.\"\n\"Rachel","1539":"Ok\"\n\"Receptionist","1540":"Have a seat through the glass doors.\"\n\"Rachel","1541":"(imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors.\"\n\"Receptionist","1542":"Through the glass doors.\"\n\"Rachel","1543":"Alright-y then.\"\n\"Receptionist","1544":"Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.\"\n\"Phoebe","1545":"Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She   sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone   who can fill in for me?\"\n\"Receptionist","1546":"Sorry, everyone is booked!\"\n\"Phoebe","1547":"But that woman can't know I work   here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this   massage chains are.\"\n\"Receptionist","1548":"Then why you work here?\"\n\"Phoebe","1549":"'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that   this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!\"\n\"Receptionist","1550":"Well, I think this is a great place to work!\"\n\"Phoebe","1551":"(watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?\"\n\"Joey","1552":"Ross!\"\n\"Ross","1553":"Hi!\"\n\"Joey","1554":"I need to talk to you about Charlie.\"\n\"Ross","1555":"(annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really?\"\n\"Joey","1556":"Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.\"\n\"Ross","1557":"Look, if you don't know what the word \"acrimonious\"   means, just don't use it!\"\n\"Joey","1558":"No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her   body is soo...\"\n\"Ross","1559":"Get to the problem!\"\n\"Joey","1560":"Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've   ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!\"\n\"Ross","1561":"(looking down) Are you wearing two belts?\"\n\"Joey","1562":"(checking) EH, what do you know!\"\n\"Ross","1563":"You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.\"\n\"Joey","1564":"Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural   places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!\"\n\"Ross","1565":"You know, I really don't want to   get involved in you guy's relationship.\"\n\"Joey","1566":"Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really   like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.\"\n\"Ross","1567":"(after a short hesitation) Fine.\"\n\"Joey","1568":"Thanks.\"\n\"Ross","1569":"Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!\"\n\"Joey","1570":"The Metsss!\"\n\"Ross","1571":"Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.\"\n\"Joey","1572":"(realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're   gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum,   and avoid all the confusion!\"\n\"Ross","1573":"Yeah, most of it it's a place\"\n\"Joey","1574":"Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.\"\n\"Ross","1575":"Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore   on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture,   you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the   Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that   she'd love.\"\n\"Joey","1576":"Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!\"\n\"Ross","1577":"But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for   Thai food...\"\n\"Joey","1578":"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go\"\n\"Ross","1579":"Ok.\"\n\"Joey","1580":"You got to tell me exactly what to do there.\"\n\"Ross","1581":"Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities   wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.\"\n\"Joey","1582":"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make   the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the   right and Joey nods)\"\n\"Chandler","1583":"I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I   know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.\"\n\"Monica","1584":"Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody   is gonna wanna watch that.\"\n\"Nurse","1585":"Mr. Bing? (Chandler jumps up) Here you are! You'll go into that   room and deposit your specimen into the container.\"\n\"Chandler","1586":"Deposit my specimen? You know,   usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind   of talk. Thanks, got it.\"\n\"Monica","1587":"Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going   to be ok?\"\n\"Chandler","1588":"Yeah, I guess!\"\n\"Monica","1589":"I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even   knows you!\"\n\"Janice","1590":"OH MY GOD!!\"\n\"Chandler","1591":"Oh, Come on!\"\n\"Janice","1592":"Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!\"\n\"Monica","1593":"Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!\"\n\"Chandler","1594":"Why are you here?\"\n\"Janice","1595":"Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time   because apparently we...\"\n\"Chandler","1596":"(to Heaven) No no no... I mean,\"\n\"Janice","1597":"Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz   they have to do it in a cup! (laughs) Oh! They gave you the kiddy size (looking   at the cup in his hand).\"\n\"Chandler","1598":"What!?\"\n\"Monica","1599":"This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!   (leaves)\"\n\"Chandler","1600":"I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got   a hot date... (starts to leave)\"\n\"Janice","1601":"Please... go! (Then shouts after him) Just let me know if you   need a hand!\"\n\"Chandler","1602":"(disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)\"\n\"Phoebe","1603":"(In a strange heavy accent) Hello \"ja\", it's time   for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.\"\n\"Rachel","1604":"Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her   head in the hole and Phoebe enters)\"\n\"Phoebe","1605":"Okay, then I'm Swedish...\"\n\"Monica","1606":"So, what's your name?\"\n\"Phoebe","1607":"It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...\"\n\"Rachel","1608":"Oh... what an interesting name.\"\n\"Phoebe","1609":"Ja!\"\n\"Rachel","1610":"You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's   direction)\"\n\"Phoebe","1611":"(pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!\"\n\"Rachel","1612":"(Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love   your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)\"\n\"Phoebe","1613":"Is something wrong?\"\n\"Rachel","1614":"No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause)   Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?\"\n\"Phoebe","1615":"(Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.\"\n\"Rachel","1616":"Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!\"\n\"Joey","1617":"(gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly   lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors   as his elusive subject was light itself.\"\n\"Ross","1618":"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?\"\n\"Joey","1619":"(shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth   says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!\"\n\"Ross","1620":"Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt   M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.\"\n\"Joey","1621":"Phonetically? (Looks confused)\"\n\"Ross","1622":"Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time   for this.\"\n\"Joey","1623":"Ok.\"\n\"Ross","1624":"Ok, but you know what? I gotta say,   I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!\"\n\"Joey","1625":"Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on \"Days\"   I had to say \"Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy\".\"\n\"Ross","1626":"Wow. What does\"\n\"Joey","1627":"No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I   guess it means \"you're gonna get eaten by a bear\".\"\n\"Ross","1628":"Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?\"\n\"Joey","1629":"Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish   of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the   imaginary painting).\"\n\"Ross","1630":"Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing   and dude, you can't\"\n\"Joey","1631":"Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)\"\n\"Ross","1632":"No! (Slaps his hand)\"\n\"Chandler","1633":"(To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the   room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.   Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees   Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?\"\n\"Janice","1634":"Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so   this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?\"\n\"Chandler","1635":"Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!\"\n\"Janice","1636":"That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes   next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?\"\n\"Chandler","1637":"I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...   I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.\"\n\"Janice","1638":"Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.\"\n\"Chandler","1639":"(Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there   is a reason why we can't have a baby?\"\n\"Janice","1640":"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.   I am sure it's gonna be just fine.\"\n\"Chandler","1641":"(smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe   I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to...   come here and do... 'that'...\"\n\"Janice","1642":"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you   can't do it at a doctor's office?\"\n\"Chandler","1643":"(stares at her intently, then yells) It was a \"Wendy's!!   \"\n\"Phoebe","1644":"(Singing) \"Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! \" And that is   the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)\"\n\"Rachel","1645":"Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have   a friend who is a masseuse.\"\n\"Phoebe","1646":"Oh, Ja! Ja!\"\n\"Rachel","1647":"Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated)\"\n\"Phoebe","1648":"Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?\"\n\"Rachel","1649":"I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy   fingers from playing crummy guitar...\"\n\"Phoebe","1650":"Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're   such a high maintenance tight ass!\"\n\"Rachel","1651":"(now lifts her head) Phoebe!!\"\n\"Phoebe","1652":"You know it's me?\"\n\"Rachel","1653":"For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!\"\n\"Phoebe","1654":"How can you come here?\"\n\"Rachel","1655":"How could you not tell me you worked here?\"\n\"Phoebe","1656":"I don't have to tell you everything!\"\n\"Rachel","1657":"Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting   a free massage!\"\n\"Phoebe","1658":"Tips not included.\"\n\"Rachel","1659":"Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?\"\n\"Phoebe","1660":"Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then   they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know...   you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and\"\n\"Rachel","1661":"Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there   right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles   and I\"\n\"Phoebe","1662":"You know what? You are right. I\"\n\"Rachel","1663":"Good for you Pheebs!\"\n\"Phoebe","1664":"Ok.\"\n\"Phoebe","1665":"Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and   whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean\"\n\"Ross","1666":"Haha! Got ya! Die, die,\"\n\"Ross","1667":"(recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor   R. Geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the   sofa) Hey!\"\n\"Charlie","1668":"Hi!\"\n\"Ross","1669":"Hey, how was the Met?\"\n\"Charlie","1670":"The museum was amazing!\"\n\"Ross","1671":"Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?\"\n\"Charlie","1672":"Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to   say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.\"\n\"Ross","1673":"What do you mean?\"\n\"Charlie","1674":"Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere   around.\"\n\"Ross","1675":"(perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked   into the Met, did you go to the right?\"\n\"Charlie","1676":"No, we went to the left.\"\n\"Ross","1677":"(shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like   you guys are having a great time together.\"\n\"Charlie","1678":"Yeah, it's fun (hesitating).\"\n\"Ross","1679":"What?\"\n\"Charlie","1680":"Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really   know me that well; it would be weird.\"\n\"Ross","1681":"What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.\"\n\"Charlie","1682":"Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy   to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common   with. You know what I mean?\"\n\"Ross","1683":"(slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey   a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about   art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.\"\n\"Charlie","1684":"Yeah, I guess that's true.\"\n\"Ross","1685":"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all   that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You   know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.\"\n\"Charlie","1686":"He is very sweet. Plus he's\"\n\"Ross","1687":"That was going to be my next argument.\"\n\"Joey","1688":"Hey!\"\n\"Ross","1689":"Hey!\"\n\"Charlie","1690":"Hey!\"\n\"Joey","1691":"(to Charlie) You're ready?\"\n\"Charlie","1692":"Yeah, let's go. (stands up and kisses Joey) (to Ross) Thanks   Ross.\"\n\"Joey","1693":"(aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me   up.\"\n\"Ross","1694":"Glad I could help man.\"\n\"Joey","1695":"Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna   be, but... (confidently) I made it work.\"\n\"Chandler","1696":"(picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited   his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.\"\n\"Chandler","1697":"Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here   but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile   fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause)   Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)\"\n\"Monica","1698":"Hey sweetie.\"\n\"Chandler","1699":"Doctor Connelly just called.\"\n\"Monica","1700":"With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course   it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) \"Doctor Connelly just called\".   If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) \"Doctor Connelly just   called! \" But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem   with me or with you?\"\n\"Chandler","1701":"Actually it's both of us.\"\n\"Monica","1702":"What?\"\n\"Chandler","1703":"Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable   environment.\"\n\"Monica","1704":"Oh... what does that mean?\"\n\"Chandler","1705":"It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers   and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It   means...\"\n\"Monica","1706":"Chandler?\"\n\"Chandler","1707":"(seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's   a good chance this may never happen for us.\"\n\"Monica","1708":"(weeping) Oh my God!\"\n\"Chandler","1709":"I'm sorry.\"\n\"Monica","1710":"I'm sorry too.\"\n\"Chandler","1711":"Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.\"\n\"Monica","1712":"(still weeping) I know.\"\n\"Receptionist","1713":"Good morning Phoebe.\"\n\"Phoebe","1714":"(imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist.\"\n\"Receptionist","1715":"Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is   in room No. 1.\"\n\"Phoebe","1716":"Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back?\"\n\"Phoebe","1717":"(through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for   your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.\"\n\"Charlie","1718":"(while Joey's giving her a massage) Oh! That feels sooo good!\"\n\"Rachel","1719":"(speaking to herself and reading Cosmopolitan) Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!\"\n\"Charlie","1720":"I'm sorry, what?\"\n\"Rachel","1721":"Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.\"\n\"Charlie","1722":"From... Cosmo??\"\n\"Rachel","1723":"Yeah, yeah... It's... \"climax your way to better skin\".\"\n\"Charlie","1724":"(to Joey) So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!\"\n\"Joey","1725":"So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.\"\n\"Rachel","1726":"(hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!\"\n\"Joey","1727":"Oh hey Rach!\"\n\"Rachel","1728":"Yeah...\"\n\"Joey","1729":"Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.\"\n\"Rachel","1730":"Oh, well...\"\n\"Charlie","1731":"I'm sure you have better things to do.\"\n\"Joey","1732":"Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.\"\n\"Charlie","1733":"If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.\"\n\"Rachel","1734":"Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!\"\n\"Joey","1735":"(to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!\"\n\"Phoebe","1736":"(entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok, great! All right, bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) That's off, right?\"\n\"Joey","1737":"What's the matter, Pheebs?\"\n\"Phoebe","1738":"Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like \"Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!\". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!\"\n\"Rachel","1739":"Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!\"\n\"Phoebe","1740":"Exactly!\"\n\"Rachel","1741":"And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!\"\n\"Phoebe","1742":"(after a short pause) I didn't even think about that! (pause) Aaargh,\"\n\"Rachel","1743":"Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.\"\n\"Phoebe","1744":"Ok, that'll be great!\"\n\"Joey","1745":"Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.\"\n\"Rachel","1746":"That's not what we're gonna do!\"\n\"Joey","1747":"Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?\"\n\"Chandler","1748":"(looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a\"\n\"Monica","1749":"Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!\"\n\"Chandler","1750":"Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!\"\n\"Doctor Connelly","1751":"(entering) Hi there.\"\n\"Chandler","1752":"Hi.\"\n\"Monica","1753":"Hi.\"\n\"Doctor Connelly","1754":"I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.\"\n\"Monica","1755":"Ok.\"\n\"Doctor Connelly","1756":"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.\"\n\"Chandler","1757":"Oh, DAMN IT!\"\n\"Monica","1758":"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.\"\n\"Doctor Connelly","1759":"Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.\"\n\"Monica","1760":"(long pause) Ok.\"\n\"Doctor Connelly","1761":"And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.\"\n\"Chandler","1762":"Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!\"\n\"Rachel","1763":"Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?\"\n\"Charlie","1764":"Oh, yeah! Let's do it!\"\n\"Joey","1765":"(to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)\"\n\"Rachel","1766":"Not gonna find any clothes in there!\"\n\"Ross","1767":"(entering) Hey, you guys!\"\n\"Rachel","1768":"Hi.\"\n\"Ross","1769":"Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?\"\n\"Charlie","1770":"Umh... Kurts Baley?\"\n\"Ross","1771":"Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh, then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well, why are you laughing?\"\n\"Joey","1772":"Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!\"\n\"Charlie","1773":"So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?\"\n\"Ross","1774":"Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.\"\n\"Charlie","1775":"He's a pretty tough guy to impress.\"\n\"Ross","1776":"Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.\"\n\"Rachel","1777":"Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?\"\n\"Ross","1778":"Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).\"\n\"Chandler","1779":"(entering) Hey guys!\"\n\"Ross","1780":"Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.\"\n\"Chandler","1781":"I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.\"\n\"Ross","1782":"It's in Barbados.\"\n\"Chandler","1783":"But you come first!\"\n\"Rachel","1784":"I'm there!\"\n\"Charlie","1785":"We'll see you, guys! (she goes)\"\n\"Joey","1786":"Bye.\"\n\"Rachel","1787":"Bye, see ya. (she goes)\"\n\"Chandler","1788":"(sitting down on the couch) Ok.\"\n\"Joey","1789":"All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?\"\n\"Chandler","1790":"Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.\"\n\"Ross","1791":"So-so what did the doctor say?\"\n\"Chandler","1792":"Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.\"\n\"Joey","1793":"So you're ruling out surrogacy?\"\n\"Chandler","1794":"Yeah.\"\n\"Joey","1795":"So, I don't have to learn what that means?\"\n\"Chandler","1796":"Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.\"\n\"Joey","1797":"Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?\"\n\"Chandler","1798":"(stopping Joey) ah-ha!\"\n\"Ross","1799":"How do you feel about all this?\"\n\"Chandler","1800":"I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.\"\n\"Joey","1801":"Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!\"\n\"Ross","1802":"(puzzled) What?\"\n\"Ross","1803":"(looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!\"\n\"Ross","1804":"The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.\"\n\"Professor Sherman","1805":"Mmm-mm.\"\n\"Ross","1806":"(reading from a notepad) I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!\"\n\"Ross","1807":"Oh, that's not what you want...\"\n\"Shop assistant","1808":"(to a girl) Incentive For Men?\"\n\"Phoebe","1809":"Oh, I'll take some of that.\"\n\"Rachel","1810":"Pheebs, that's for men!\"\n\"Phoebe","1811":"No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah.\"\n\"Phoebe","1812":"Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!\"\n\"Charlie","1813":"(to Rachel) So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?\"\n\"Rachel","1814":"On Melanie Griffith in \"Working girl\". I think what you want is over here.\"\n\"Charlie","1815":"See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a \"thank you\", I would really love to take you out.\"\n\"Rachel","1816":"Really?\"\n\"Charlie","1817":"Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?\"\n\"Rachel","1818":"Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.\"\n\"Charlie","1819":"You've seen\"\n\"Rachel","1820":"Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!\"\n\"Phoebe","1821":"(picks up a dress) Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?\"\n\"Rachel","1822":"Sure!\"\n\"Phoebe","1823":"Ok!\"\n\"Charlie","1824":"Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!\"\n\"Rachel","1825":"You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.\"\n\"Phoebe","1826":"So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?\"\n\"Rachel","1827":"She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!\"\n\"Phoebe","1828":"Why?\"\n\"Rachel","1829":"I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!\"\n\"Phoebe","1830":"Who else?\"\n\"Rachel","1831":"Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...\"\n\"Phoebe","1832":"You like Joey?\"\n\"Rachel","1833":"Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.\"\n\"Phoebe","1834":"(whispering) Oh my God!\"\n\"Rachel","1835":"It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!\"\n\"Phoebe","1836":"Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?\"\n\"Rachel","1837":"(annoyed) Oh, I get it!\"\n\"Phoebe","1838":"Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.\"\n\"Rachel","1839":"I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.\"\n\"Phoebe","1840":"Yeah.\"\n\"Rachel","1841":"So can we keep this between us?\"\n\"Phoebe","1842":"Sure!\"\n\"Rachel","1843":"Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!\"\n\"Phoebe","1844":"Oh.\"\n\"Phoebe","1845":"Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?\"\n\"Monica","1846":"Hi honey!\"\n\"Chandler","1847":"Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!\"\n\"Monica","1848":"Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!\"\n\"Zack","1849":"(shaking Monica's hand) You too.\"\n\"Chandler","1850":"You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.\"\n\"Monica","1851":"I got it.\"\n\"Zack","1852":"Thanks.\"\n\"Chandler","1853":"(to Mon) So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?\"\n\"Monica","1854":"Yeah, I guess.\"\n\"Chandler","1855":"So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!\"\n\"Monica","1856":"(turns around and she's quite shocked) Excuse me?\"\n\"Chandler","1857":"Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is \"spermtastic\"!\"\n\"Monica","1858":"Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! \"Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm\"!\"\n\"Chandler","1859":"No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.\"\n\"Monica","1860":"Chandler!\"\n\"Chandler","1861":"I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!\"\n\"Monica","1862":"I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!\"\n\"Chandler","1863":"Ok!\"\n\"Monica","1864":"Uh!\"\n\"Chandler","1865":"(bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!\"\n\"Zack","1866":"Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.\"\n\"very","1867":"very\"\n\"Monica","1868":"Tell me about yourself, Zack!\"\n\"Rachel","1869":"Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!\"\n\"Phoebe","1870":"Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.\"\n\"Rachel","1871":"Ok, great!\"\n\"Rachel","1872":"Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!\"\n\"Phoebe","1873":"(sticks her head out) I didn't say anything yet!\"\n\"Rachel","1874":"(sticks her head out too) Well, get back in there and talk!\"\n\"Phoebe","1875":"(goes back in) I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.\"\n\"Rachel","1876":"(comes out again) What!?\"\n\"Phoebe","1877":"(comes out too) Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.\"\n\"Rachel","1878":"Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!\"\n\"Phoebe","1879":"Ooh! We have a problem.\"\n\"Rachel","1880":"Oh! What are we gonna do?\"\n\"Stranger","1881":"Just be honest with her.\"\n\"Rachel","1882":"Oh my God!\"\n\"Stranger","1883":"And it\"\n\"Rachel","1884":"(yelling at the stranger) Alright! Enough out of you!\"\n\"Joey","1885":"Hello?\"\n\"Ross","1886":"Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?\"\n\"Joey","1887":"No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?\"\n\"Ross","1888":"I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...\"\n\"Joey","1889":"Oh! How's it going?\"\n\"Ross","1890":"It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!\"\n\"Joey","1891":"What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!\"\n\"Ross","1892":"Barbados.\"\n\"Joey","1893":"Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!\"\n\"Ross","1894":"What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.\"\n\"Joey","1895":"Well, just wake him up!\"\n\"Ross","1896":"I can't! If he realizes that\"\n\"Joey","1897":"Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was\"\n\"Monica","1898":"Hey guys! Dinner's ready!\"\n\"Zack","1899":"Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. (Chandler points him the bathroom) Thanks!\"\n\"Chandler","1900":"So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!\"\n\"Monica","1901":"Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain\"\n\"Chandler","1902":"You don't like him.\"\n\"Monica","1903":"I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything\"\n\"Chandler","1904":"Alright! Just follow my lead!\"\n\"Zack","1905":"You guys have such a great place here.\"\n\"Chandler","1906":"Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?\"\n\"Zack","1907":"Uhm... no. Although I\"\n\"Chandler","1908":"(very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.\"\n\"Zack","1909":"(looking very puzzled) Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.\"\n\"Monica","1910":"Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?\"\n\"Zack","1911":"(after a pause, very confused) No...\"\n\"Monica","1912":"Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?\"\n\"Zack","1913":"You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?\"\n\"Monica","1914":"We're just making conversation. (Chandler makes an agreeing-sound)\"\n\"Zack","1915":"Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...\"\n\"Chandler","1916":"You know what's\"\n\"Zack","1917":"Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?\"\n\"Monica & Chandler","1918":"Sure! Alright...\"\n\"Zack","1919":"Ravioli's delicious!\"\n\"Chandler","1920":"I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?\"\n\"Zack","1921":"No I didn't.\"\n\"Monica","1922":"Yess!! (M & C high-five and Zack looks confused again)\"\n\"Chandler","1923":"(Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!\"\n\"Rachel","1924":"Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.\"\n\"Phoebe","1925":"Good plan.\"\n\"Rachel","1926":"Ok. (Phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. Rachel sees and follows her) Wha...? where? Where are you going?\"\n\"Phoebe","1927":"Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at \"who's more over who\"! (at which she walks away)\"\n\"Rachel","1928":"(to Charlie) Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?\"\n\"Charlie","1929":"Oh! trying on clothes.\"\n\"Rachel","1930":"(pretends to be stunned) Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!\"\n\"Charlie","1931":"(smiling) Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.\"\n\"Rachel","1932":"Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.\"\n\"Charlie","1933":"No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.\"\n\"Rachel","1934":"(after a pause) Yeah.\"\n\"Charlie","1935":"It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?\"\n\"Rachel","1936":"Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!\"\n\"Charlie","1937":"Wow!\"\n\"Rachel","1938":"Yeah...\"\n\"Charlie","1939":"You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person.\"\n\"Rachel","1940":"(Looks ashamed) I try...\"\n\"Ross","1941":"(To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want\"\n\"Prof. Sherman","1942":"(confused) You're welcome. (Ross hugs him again)\"\n\"Joey","1943":"(impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! Which is like the\"\n\"Phoebe","1944":"Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.\"\n\"Joey","1945":"Then don't go!\"\n\"Phoebe","1946":"Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.\"\n\"Joey","1947":"Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!\"\n\"Phoebe","1948":"You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.\"\n\"Phoebe","1949":"David?\"\n\"David","1950":"Phoebe! Hi!\"\n\"Phoebe","1951":"Oh my God! (they hug)\"\n\"David","1952":"Wow, you look unbelievable.\"\n\"Phoebe","1953":"Yeah. What-what are you doing here?\"\n\"David","1954":"Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.\"\n\"Phoebe","1955":"What happened?\"\n\"David","1956":"Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?\"\n\"Phoebe","1957":"Yeah?\"\n\"David","1958":"Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.\"\n\"Phoebe","1959":"Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?\"\n\"David","1960":"Good, good, life is good...\"\n\"Phoebe","1961":"Good!\"\n\"David","1962":"Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.\"\n\"Phoebe","1963":"(disappointed) Oh, good for you.\"\n\"David","1964":"She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said \"Boy, I want that\".\"\n\"Phoebe","1965":"Mike and I broke up.\"\n\"David","1966":"You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up.\"\n\"Phoebe","1967":"Really?\"\n\"David","1968":"Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face.\"\n\"Phoebe","1969":"I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!\"\n\"David","1970":"Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?\"\n\"Phoebe","1971":"Well... (pause) no.\"\n\"David","1972":"Do you wanna get a drink?\"\n\"Phoebe","1973":"I'd love to.\"\n\"David","1974":"Great.\"\n\"Phoebe","1975":"Ok. (they walk away together)\"\n\"David","1976":"Do you smell beets?\"\n\"Phoebe","1977":"Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.\"\n\"Charlie","1978":"Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?\"\n\"Rachel","1979":"No, that's David.\"\n\"Charlie","1980":"There's a third guy?\"\n\"Rachel","1981":"(disapprovingly) Tip of the iceberg.\"\n\"Zack","1982":"I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?\"\n\"Chandler","1983":"You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?\"\n\"Zack","1984":"No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.\"\n\"Chandler","1985":"Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.\"\n\"Zack","1986":"No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.\"\n\"Chandler","1987":"Ok.\"\n\"Chandler","1988":"I think we've found our sperm!\"\n\"Monica","1989":"Does seem pretty perfect.\"\n\"Chandler","1990":"Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?\"\n\"Monica","1991":"(pause) No.\"\n\"Chandler","1992":"Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!\"\n\"Monica","1993":"No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.\"\n\"Chandler","1994":"Yeah, he's better!\"\n\"Monica","1995":"No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.\"\n\"Chandler","1996":"Really? Are you sure?\"\n\"Monica","1997":"Yeah, I'm sure.\"\n\"Chandler","1998":"(sighs with relief) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.\"\n\"Monica","1999":"That is so sweet. I love you. (they kiss)\"\n\"Chandler","2000":"So you know this leaves us with...\"\n\"Monica","2001":"Adoption.\"\n\"Chandler","2002":"How do you feel about that?\"\n\"Monica","2003":"I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.\"\n\"Chandler","2004":"Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.\"\n\"Monica","2005":"So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?\"\n\"Chandler","2006":"(smiling) Yeah.\"\n\"Monica","2007":"(excitedly) Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!\"\n\"Chandler","2008":"We are gonna be\"\n\"Monica","2009":"And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there (they go look through the window) our baby could be being conceived.\"\n\"Chandler","2010":"Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!\"\n\"Chandler","2011":"Hey, Zack!\"\n\"Zack","2012":"(hardly enthusiastic) Hey Chandler.\"\n\"Chandler","2013":"Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.\"\n\"Zack","2014":"No you didn't.\"\n\"Chandler","2015":"Really?\"\n\"Zack","2016":"No you did.\"\n\"Chandler","2017":"My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.\"\n\"Jeanette","2018":"(to Zack) Here are the boards for Friday's pitch (hands him something).\"\n\"Zack","2019":"Oh, thank you.\"\n\"Chandler","2020":"You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?\"\n\"Joey","2021":"(entering) Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!\"\n\"Ross","2022":"Oh, that's right! (to Emma) Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?\"\n\"Joey","2023":"Mmh-mmh.\"\n\"Ross","2024":"(to Emma) Can you say Barbados?\"\n\"Joey","2025":"Barbados!\"\n\"Ross","2026":"Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the\"\n\"Rachel","2027":"Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?\"\n\"Chandler","2028":"Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, \"island's stuff\".\"\n\"Phoebe","2029":"I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.\"\n\"Ross","2030":"Oh, right, because he's a scientist!\"\n\"Phoebe","2031":"No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.\"\n\"Ross","2032":"Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.\"\n\"Joey","2033":"All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.\"\n\"Ross","2034":"It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!\"\n\"Charlie","2035":"Wow! This place is beautiful!\"\n\"Ross","2036":"(very excited) Look at all these paleontologists!!\"\n\"Joey","2037":"I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (A woman goes towards them)\"\n\"Woman","2038":"Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!\"\n\"Joey","2039":"(to Charlie) I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!\"\n\"Woman","2040":"Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!\"\n\"Joey","2041":"That... never happens...\"\n\"Woman","2042":"I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech.\"\n\"Ross","2043":"Wow! This is very flattering, uh...\"\n\"Woman","2044":"I would love your autograph. (hands him a notepad)\"\n\"Ross","2045":"Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... \"Dear...\" (he takes the notepad)\"\n\"Woman","2046":"Sarah.\"\n\"Ross","2047":"\"... Sarah. I"},

{"0":"Monica","1":"(to Chandler) See?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Yeah, that's the same as \"it has something to do with wind\"."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip."},

{"0":"David","1":"Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."},

{"0":"David","1":"That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!"},

{"0":"Monica","1":"Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"I"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say \"No\", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Man, that's some"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Hey! Hey what's going on?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in (Joey, Chandler and David leave)"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(to Chandler) Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"(shouts after David) Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(shouts to Chandler) And make sure our room isn't next to theirs (points to Phoebe)."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could (looks at Joey who is at the check in desk) share that with a guy."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Yeah, right!"},
{"0":"David","1":"So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight. (Removes a ring box from his pocket and opens it to show Chandler the ring)"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Tonight?! (looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) Oh, there it is!"},
{"0":"David","1":"Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica)"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? (Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Ok!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"David is going to propose to Phoebe"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"That would be advice!!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Ok fine. I'll handle this. (goes to Phoebe who's talking to Rachel) Phoebe?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Yeah?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(looking very serious) I need to talk to you."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Are you leaving \"The Supremes\"? (Monica and Phoebe go to one side)"},
{"0":"MOnica","1":"Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Wow? Really? That's fantastic!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike..."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (Someone knocks on the door, Ross goes to open and it's Joey, Rachel and Chandler)."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Hey guys!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"The chocolates aren't here yet."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Damnit!"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"If you want to check your email, just ask! (Chandler tries to look offended)"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(offended) What? (pause) May I?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"(looking out the window) What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Actually the wet season is June to December."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"It's not the time Charlie."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(at the laptop) Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (Chandler looks annoyed at him and Joey leans in to him) Oh!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Wha... what do you mean? (Goes to the laptop)"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"What, oh my God. What did you do?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Why, why would you open it?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Well, it didn't say \"This is a virus\"!!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"What"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Nude... (Ross looks at him)... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"It's not"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"NO! I don't!!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"It's really gone?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"I just feel awful."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... (Ross glares at him) you know, you and Monica have the same \"I'm gonna kill you\" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Get out! (Chandler runs out)"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Well, what do"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Wha... what you really think we can do that?"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner (Looks at Joey)."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Ugh."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Alright, ok, let's do it. (Ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! (Rachel and Joey look confused) And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a \"Galaxy far, far away\"? (Ross turns aroud and glares at him. Joey and Rachel decide to leave)."},
{"0":"Mike","1":"Hello?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole \"I never want to get married\" thing and step up!"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"Who is this?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say \"yes\" but I know she really wants to be with you!"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"(sounds shocked and sits down) He... he's gonna propose?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair! (Tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"You don't tell me what to do! I tell"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(sarcastically) Well, I hope you're happy!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(pretending not to sense the tone) Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Phoebe is going to say \"Yes\" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Phoebe is going to say \"yes\"? That's, that's great!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"And there's not chance that will work?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"No, I called him. It's not gonna happen."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(pointing at her) Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"This vacation sucks!!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Well, I've brought some books. We could read."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Hey, it hasn't come to that yet."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(stopping the waiter) Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!"},
{"0":"Waiter","1":"I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention (walks away)"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"We can't. We're not pharmacists!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(walking to a table with many badges on it) I know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) Frank Medeio and... (picks up another badge) Eva Trorro... womba..."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"(picking up another random badge) Kate Miller?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Kate Miller it is. (he picks up the Kate Miller badge and sticks it on Rachel's breast)"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"In that case should I make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Thank you. (they walk away)"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Yeah, that's it?"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Yeah."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Oh my God, we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Actually"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. (he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) That's a pretty necklace."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Thank you."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Oh my God, I love you."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"That's Ben, my son from my first marriage."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Your first marriage?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Yeah."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"You're married more than once?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"No. (they clink glasses and drink)"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"So, why did you break up?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(embarassed) Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Oh my God, this is so cool!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Ok, odd thing to get excited about!"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Hey! High-five! (they high-five)"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Right and then everybody finds out and they're like: \"Oh, I knew all along\""},
{"0":"Ross","1":"I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: \"Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay\""},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"I know!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"I didn't do that."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(embarassed) Me neither."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts..."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"(takes a sip from her drink, embarassed) No."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"There it is, you're blushing!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"No, I'm not"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? (tickles her a little)"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"No."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Tell me who it is."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Joey! (she walks away; Joey goes after her teasing and tickling her)"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"What? Why not? Rach, who can"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Oh! (pause) Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(eagerly) Yeah, who is that?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Do ya?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Yeah."},
{"0":"Ross and Charlie","1":"Hey!"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"(to Joey) I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Yep, we got it, we got it. (To Charlie) Thank you so much."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"I had a great time."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who..."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Later! La..."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"So, shall we?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Yeah. (they leave)"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Ok. See you, bye."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Bye."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Good night."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Night."},
{"0":"Ross and Rachel","1":"Ok, good night!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that."},
{"0":"David","1":"Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? (doing David) \"Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh...\" Spit it out, David!"},
{"0":"David","1":"Uh, Phoebe, uh... (Chandler hits his own head) you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Sure, ok, yeah."},
{"0":"David","1":"But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end..."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Oh my God, Mike!"},
{"0":"David","1":"It's David, actually!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"No, Mike's here."},
{"0":"David","1":"(turns around) Hi Mike!"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"Hi David. Chandler. Monica... (Looks at Monica, checking her big hair, aghast) Oh!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"IT'S THE HUMIDITY!"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"Hi Phoebe."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"What are you, what are you doing here?"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"I have a question I need to ask you."},
{"0":"David","1":"I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself."},
{"0":"Mike","1":"Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this."},
{"0":"David","1":"(annoyed) Ok, would you care for my seat as well?"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"Actually yeah, that'll be great."},
{"0":"David","1":"That's fair, you've had a long trip. (he leaves his seat to Mike, and stands there looking for a chair. He finally goes to Monica and Chandler's table)"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you."},
{"0":"David","1":"Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say."},
{"0":"Mike","1":"Sorry David, but she really has to know this."},
{"0":"David","1":"Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? (Phoebe looks very flattered) Now, I don't actually have a ring..."},
{"0":"David","1":"I have a ring."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy."},
{"0":"David","1":"Phoebe, will you marry me?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"(smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!"},
{"0":"David","1":"Uhm... Ha ha!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future."},
{"0":"Mike","1":"We can have any future you want."},
{"0":"David","1":"Ok, I'm gonna take off."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry."},
{"0":"David","1":"Just so I know, if I had asked first..."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong."},
{"0":"David","1":"Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip! (he leaves)"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"Is it ok if I hug you now?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Yes! (they hug)"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(to everybody) BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"I know (she snuggles to him)"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"(walking in hurriedly) Open your drapes! Open your drapes!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"The sun is out!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Hey! Remember when I had corneas?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Nooo!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Damn it!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(from across the wall) Walls are pretty thin, guys!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating."},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus..."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(to a paleontologist sitting next to him) Not to mention the cold sores."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(to the one sitting next to him) Really?"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"What?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"He said \"erectus\"!"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"You're... you're kidding, right?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"No, he really said it."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus..."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Erectus?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Homo."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) Thank you!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Oh, thanks guys!"},
{"0":"Man with a bow tie","1":"(shaking hands with Ross) I thought... it was wonderful!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Oh!"},
{"0":"Man with a bow tie","1":"Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. (sighs) I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so..."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something's wrong with Jarvis) Ok... now... now we're just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"All right! Well, uh... (to Monica) we're gonna hit the beach?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Yeah!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"(to Ross, in a flattering tone) It was really... great!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Oh, thank you so much!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Yeah, and"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Oh!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(puzzled) Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! (to Phoebe) Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"(popping by, smiling) You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"Oh... I'm back!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(skating over, embarrassed) Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?"},
{"0":"Phoebe & Mike","1":"Yeah! (they leave)"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Hey! (she turns to him) Well...? (in expectation)"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"You were incredible!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Yeah?"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"You blew them away!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"(smiling broadly) I was"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Oh my God! (pauses) I'm your"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(joking) I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling) Look, I took it too far!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(her hair bigger then before) I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (Grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) Not you guys. You got it going on!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"So, what are we gonna do today?"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(pleasantly surprised) Ping pong? (to Chandler) Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"I don't think so!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(disappointed) Why not?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"I'm not always that bad!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Oh,"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(hesitatingly) I punched you...?"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"And...?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"... Phoebe...?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"... and...?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"I clunked your heads together!"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"(walking in) Hey! There you are!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Hey! (stands up) As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(disappointed) Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you..."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"You know... I feel so"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(interrupting her) Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... (pulls a face)"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(bewildered) Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Yeah..."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"... is it weird that it's not with each other?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Yeah! A little bit, yeah..."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"(sitting down on the bed) I think we need to talk...!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Yeah... I think we do... (sighs, with folded arms)... about what?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"C'mon guys, it'll be fun!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"But then how do we know who wins?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Nobody wins!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"So, we're just four losers... SUPER!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"I'm not playing with you."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Yeah, I'm out."},

{"0":"Monica","1":"(angry) Ow, what are the chances!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Ha! My point!"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point."},

{"0":"Rachel","1":"(pretending to be offended) What, hey!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(laughing sarcastically) Ok, Rach!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"W-What are you, what are you talking about?"},

{"0":"Rachel","1":"Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl..."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(sitting up again) I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Yeah, I'm not talking about her..."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? (gives her a meaningful look)"},

{"0":"Rachel","1":"(nearly whispering) Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(shocked) That's a"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts (pauses) musings, if you will!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"What... for how long?"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Only like a month!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(outraged) A MONTH??"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"What the... DIAL IT DOWN! (Joey goes to sit on the bed) Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know,"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(stands up) I just have one question!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"Shoot!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(desperate) What the hell are you doin'???"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... (insinuating) what that would be like?..."},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"(puzzled) Who...?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"CURIOUS GEORGE ("},

{"0":"Joey","1":"No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"But can it... just... happen a little bit?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"(charmed, but then recoiling) NO, NO! It can't happen at all!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"But why, why not?"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? (in a trembling voice) I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"But that wasn't gonna stop you before!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... (painfully) I'm sorry...!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"(regretful) I'm sorry, too! (they look at each other sadly, then she recollects, and puts her hands over her eyes) OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!"},
{"0":"Rachel","1":"It's not a big deal!"},
{"0":"Joey","1":"NO BIG DEAL!"},

{"0":"Chandler","1":"I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one."},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Oh, damn it!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"(pointing at Mike and shouting) I sleep with him!"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"(boasting) Game, point!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(threatening) Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"NO, NO, NOOO!"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"And that's how it's done! (Phoebe kisses him)"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Best out of three?"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"That's what I'm thinking."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?"},

{"0":"Charlie","1":"Uh, well... Joey and I broke up."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Oh my God, wh-what happened?"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"I knew that was him!"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(holding her hand) Hey, you ok?"},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"I guess. There was hum... (she breathes deeply) there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone (pause) else."},
{"0":"Paleontologist","1":"(merrily) Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?"},
{"0":"Professore Clerk","1":"Or we could throw you both in"},
{"0":"Ross","1":"(standing) Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with Charlie). GO, GO, GO! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)"},

{"0":"Chandler","1":"But..."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"What about the obsessive cleaning?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"That's just good sense!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(in pain) Aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream)"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"You ok?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! (she shakes the wrist and it's more painful) Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! (pause) Oh my God! I can't play!"},
{"0":"Mike","1":"So you forfeit?"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"Mike wins?"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"I can't believe it! (pause) I lost!"},

{"0":"Monica","1":"(to Chandler) Honey, you don't have to do this."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(In a loving voice) Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you."},
{"0":"Monica","1":"But... you"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"(Still in a loving voice) You're welcome, sweetheart."},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins."},
{"0":"Mike","1":"Ok!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"Oh my God! You're good!"},
{"0":"Phoebe","1":"It's like watching porn!"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"And that's... how... it's done!"},
{"0":"Monica","1":"(to Chandler) Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you (pause) Hold on! I almost forgot (she turns to Mike)"},
{"0":"Chandler","1":"I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!"},

{"0":"Ross","1":"I don't think they saw us."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"I don't think they did."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum... (pause) There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else."},

{"0":"Charlie","1":"I think you know."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so..."},
{"0":"Ross","1":"I'm sorry... we... we can't."},
{"0":"Charlie","1":"All right, all right."},
