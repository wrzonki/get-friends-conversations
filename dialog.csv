"Frannie";"Hey, Monica!"
"Monica";"Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?"
"Frannie";"You had sex, didn't you?"
"Frannie";"So? Who?"
"Monica";"You know Paul?"
"Frannie";"Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul."
"Monica";"You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?"
"Frannie";"Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was nosnap in his turtle for two years."
"Joey";"(sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line!"
"Monica";"Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?"
"Ross";"I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get youinto bed'."
"Phoebe";"All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)"
"Monica";"I just thought he was nice, y'know?"
"Joey";"(bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!"
"Rachel";"Guess what?"
"Ross";"You got a job?"
"Rachel";"Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelveinterviews today."
"Chandler";"And yet you're surprisingly upbeat."
"Rachel";"You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fiftypercent off!"
"Chandler";"Oh, how well you know me..."
"Rachel";"They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've gotgreat boots' boots!"
"Monica";"How'd you pay for them?"
"Rachel";"Uh, credit card."
"Monica";"And who pays for that?"
"Rachel";"Um... my... father."
"Monica";"C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life."
"Rachel";"I know that. That's why I was getting married."
"Phoebe";"Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time."
"Rachel";"Thank you."
"Phoebe";"You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I wasfourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I gothere, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like,cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I foundaromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel."
"Ross";"The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'..."
"Ross";"C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,..."
"Monica";"Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch?"
"Ross";"No. No, I gotta go home sometime."
"Monica";"You be okay?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?"
"Ross";"Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no-"
"Rachel";"Sorry-"
"Ross";"No no no, go-"
"Rachel";"No, you have it, really, I don't want it-"
"Ross";"Split it?"
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Ross";"Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back inhigh school, I had a, um, major crush on you."
"Rachel";"I knew."
"Ross";"You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geekyolder brother."
"Rachel";"I did."
"Ross";"Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerabilitybecome any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?Sometime? Maybe?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, maybe..."
"Ross";"Okay... okay, maybe I will..."
"Rachel";"Goodnight."
"Ross";"Goodnight."
"Monica";"See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?"
"Ross";"I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what thatmeans.)"
"Joey";"I can't believe what I'm hearing here."
"Phoebe";"(sings)"
"Monica";"What? I-I said you had a-"
"Phoebe";"(sings)"
"Monica";"(to Phoebe) Would you stop?"
"Rachel";"(walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee?"
"Chandler";"Did you make it, or are you just serving it?"
"Rachel";"I'm just serving it."
"All";"Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee."
"Joey";"Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, yeah!"
"Rachel";"Everything you need to know is in that first kiss."
"Monica";"Absolutely."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act,y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floydcomes out."
"Ross";"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that...that's not why we bought the ticket."
"Chandler";"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how greatthe show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we'rein the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake."
"Rachel";"Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next timeyou're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone."
"Ross";"No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a littleangry?"
"Marsha";"Well, she has issues."
"Ross";"Does she."
"Marsha";"He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sitsat home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!"
"Ross";"Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, thatglacier's getting kinda close.' See?"
"Marsha";"Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?"
"Ross";"(trying to ignore her) No. No."
"Marsha";"Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!"
"Ross";"Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you inthe Ice Age."
"Ross";"Hi."
"Carol";"So."
"Ross";"You look great. I, uh... I hate that."
"Carol";"Sorry. You look good too."
"Ross";"Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still,uh..."
"Carol";"A lesbian?"
"Ross";"Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?"
"Carol";"Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-"
"Ross";"Why- why are you here, Carol?"
"Carol";"I'm pregnant."
"Ross";"Pregnant?!"
"Phoebe";"...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)"
"Monica";"(taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?"
"Joey";"Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down."
"Monica";"Whose little ball of paper is this?!"
"Chandler";"Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then Irealised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him)...now I wish I was dead."
"Phoebe";"She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've alreadyfluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine!"
"Monica";"Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunitionthan they already have."
"Chandler";"Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of achild's pillow."
"Phoebe";"Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you'relike all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way."
"Joey";"Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly everytime they come."
"Monica";"That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong.Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born."
"Chandler";"(looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!"
"Monica";"What?"
"Chandler";"Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!"
"All";"Eeaagh!"
"Rachel";"Has anybody seen my engagement ring?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, it's beautiful."
"Rachel";"Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look underthe couch cushions.)"
"Phoebe";"No, look, don't touch that!"
"Rachel";"Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back tohim... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in frontof your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without thering, which makes it so much harder..."
"Monica";"Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we!"
"Chandler";"You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days..."
"Rachel";"I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in thekitchen with..."
"Chandler";"...Dinah?"
"Rachel";"(looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad..."
"Monica";"You didn't."
"Rachel";"Oh, I am sorry..."
"Monica";"I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom ofthe glass pan.)"
"Rachel";"Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!"
"Chandler";"Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ringin a lasagne..."
"Monica";"(puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it."
"Chandler";"Boys? We're going in."
"Monica";"Wow. That is not a happy hi."
"Ross";"Carol's pregnant."
"Phoebe";"(while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it!"
"Monica";"W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-..."
"Ross";"Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right aboutnow. (He enters.)"
"Chandler";"Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?"
"Rachel";"Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?"
"Ross";"Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm notcomfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me."
"Phoebe";"She is so great! I miss her."
"Monica";"What does she mean by 'involved'?"
"Chandler";"I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done."
"Ross";"Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with themtomorrow."
"Rachel";"So what are you gonna do?"
"Ross";"I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father."
"Mrs. Geller";"Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack)Mmm! What's that curry taste?"
"Monica";"Curry."
"Mrs. Geller";"Mmmm!"
"Ross";"I- I think they're great! I, I really do."
"Mr. Geller";"(To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing foryou, didn't she?"
"Mrs. Geller";"They all had a thing for him."
"Ross";"Aw, Mom..."
"Monica";"I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?"
"Mrs. Geller";"Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking,or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-"
"Monica";"No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant."
"Mrs. Geller";"Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the samepillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)"
"Monica";"Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?"
"Ross";"Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)"
"Mrs. Geller";"Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy."
"Monica";"I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were youplanning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take someof the heat off me."
"Mrs. Geller";"What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at theclub, they were not playing very well."
"Mr. Geller";"I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but fortythousand dollars is a lot of money!"
"Mrs. Geller";"Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar..."
"Monica";"What's that supposed to mean?"
"Mrs. Geller";"Nothing! It's an expression."
"Monica";"No it's not."
"Mr. Geller";"Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always havebeen! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you werejust fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles..."
"Mr. Geller";"...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thankGod 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem."
"Monica";"(trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going onwith you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes toshare with the folks?"
"Ross";"(pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realiseyou guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well,here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnantwith my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby."
"Mrs. Geller";"(To Monica) And you knew about this?!"
"Joey";"Your folks are really that bad, huh?"
"Ross";"Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, theytake their time, they get the job done."
"Monica";"Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if youcould- (To Ross) -I'd want yours."
"Ross";"Must pee. (Goes to pee.)"
"Phoebe";"Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins."
"Rachel";"You're twins?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type."
"Chandler";"What does she do?"
"Phoebe";"She's a waitress."
"Rachel";"All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start toleave.)"
"Monica";"Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this."
"Chandler";"Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parentsactually preferred."
"Rachel";"The lights, please.."
"Ross";"...How long was I in there?"
"Rachel";"I'm just cleaning up."
"Ross";"D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?"
"Rachel";"Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)"
"Ross";"Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barrytomorrow?"
"Rachel";"Oh.. a little.."
"Ross";"Mm-hmm.."
"Rachel";"A lot."
"Ross";"Mm."
"Rachel";"So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?"
"Ross";"Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he'sgonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look tooterrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll giveBarry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN..."
"Rachel";"Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?"
"Ross";"Got me."
"Rachel";"Remember when we were in high school together?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love-and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross?"
"Ross";"Yes, yes!"
"Rachel";"Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)"
"Ross";"Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move hishand.)"
"Ross";"(entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this bigdinosaur.. thing.. anyway."
"Susan";"Hi."
"Carol";"Ross, you remember Susan."
"Ross";"How could I forget?"
"Susan";"Ross."
"Ross";"(they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So,uh, we're just waiting for...?"
"Carol";"Dr. Oberman."
"Ross";"..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-"
"Susan";"She."
"Ross";"-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?"
"Carol";"Yes, and she's very supportive."
"Ross";"Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh."
"Carol";"Thanks."
"Ross";"(picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.."
"Carol";"Ross? That opens my cervix. (He drops it in horror.)"
"Rachel";"Barry?"
"Barry";"C'mon in."
"Rachel";"(hesitates) Are you sure?"
"Barry";"Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours."
"Robbie";"Huh?!"
"Barry";"So, how ya doin?"
"Rachel";"I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!"
"Barry";"Yeah, well.."
"Barry";"(answering the intercom) Be right there. (To Robbie and Rachel) Be backin a sec."
"Rachel";"I dumped him."
"Robbie";"Okay."
"Ross";"So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know,when, like, important decisions have to be made?"
"Carol";"Give me a 'for instance'."
"Ross";"Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with thebaby's name?"
"Carol";"Marlon-"
"Ross";"Marlon?!"
"Carol";"-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl."
"Ross";"...As in Mouse?"
"Carol";"As in my grandmother."
"Ross";"Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how aboutJulia?"
"Carol";"Julia.."
"Susan";"We agreed on Minnie."
"Ross";"'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together.Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?"
"Barry";"Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?"
"Rachel";"Oh, not much. I-I got a job."
"Barry";"Oh, that's great."
"Rachel";"Why are- why are you so tanned?"
"Barry";"Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba."
"Rachel";"Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?"
"Barry";"No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt."
"Robbie";"Me?!"
"Barry";"No! (To Rachel) I went with Mindy."
"Rachel";"Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!"
"Barry";"Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now."
"Rachel";"Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You've got plugs!"
"Barry";"Careful! They haven't quite taken yet."
"Rachel";"And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!"
"Barry";"Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you."
"Rachel";"Okay.."
"Barry";"See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wantedto hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist."
"Rachel";"Wow."
"Barry";"You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren'thappy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Robbie";"Me. (Spits.)"
"Rachel";"Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs toyou. And thank you for giving it to me."
"Barry";"Well, thank you for giving it back."
"Robbie";"Hello?!"
"Susan";"Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?"
"Ross";"Helen Geller? I don't think so."
"Carol";"Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller."
"Ross";"Thank you!"
"Carol";"No, I mean it's not Geller."
"Ross";"What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?"
"Carol";"No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch."
"Ross";"Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?"
"Susan";"It's my baby too."
"Ross";"Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm."
"Susan";"Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!"
"Carol";"All right, you two, stop it!"
"Ross";"No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too."
"Carol";"Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause Ithink that borders on child abuse."
"Ross";"Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch."
"Susan";"Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna sayall those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!"
"Ross";"My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I everimagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this istoo hard. I'm not, I can't do-"
"Dr. Oberman";"(entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?"
"All";"Yeah. Yeah. A little."
"Dr. Oberman";"Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks forsharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.."
"Ross";"You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can beinvolved in this particular thing right now."
"Ross";"Oh my God."
"Susan";"Look at that."
"Carol";"I know."
"Ross";"Well? Isn't that amazing?"
"Joey";"What are we supposed to be seeing here?"
"Chandler";"I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise."
"Phoebe";"You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, itkinda looks like an old potato."
"Ross";"Then don't do that, alright?"
"Phoebe";"Okay!"
"Ross";"(walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think?"
"Monica";"(welling up) Mm-hmm."
"Ross";"Wh- are you welling up?"
"Monica";"No."
"Ross";"You are, you're welling up."
"Monica";"Am not!"
"Ross";"You're gonna be an aunt."
"Monica";"(pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hi guys!"
"All";"Hey, Pheebs! Hi!"
"Ross";"Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?"
"Phoebe";"Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do thisagain!'"
"All";"Ohh. Ouch."
"Rachel";"What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?"
"Monica";"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You willnever see me naked'."
"Rachel";"Since when?"
"Joey";"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means'It is you'."
"Chandler";"Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearingalcoholics and complaining about them to you'."
"Phoebe";"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha,I already am'."
"Rachel";"And everybody knows this?"
"Joey";"Yeah. Cushions the blow."
"Chandler";"Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog tosleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm."
"Ross";"That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, sendour dog off to live on a farm."
"Monica";"Uh, Ross."
"Ross";"What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they hadthis unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was-it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!"
"Chandler";""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?""
"Joey";""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have tolive with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.""
"Chandler";"Hey, that was really good!"
"Joey";"Thanks! Let's keep going."
"Chandler";"Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?""
"Joey";""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I cansmoke.""
"Chandler";""Smoke away.""
"Chandler";"I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone."
"Joey";"What?"
"Chandler";"Relax your hand!"
"Chandler";"Not so much!"
"Joey";"Whoah!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Alright, now try taking a puff."
"Chandler";"Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me."
"Joey";"No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette."
"Chandler";"It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here."
"Chandler";"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's beenmissing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete."
"Joey";"Y'miss it?"
"Chandler";"Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my..God. (He continues to smoke.)"
"Monica";"No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of aguy's thumb to the tip of his index finger."
"Joey";"That's ridiculous!"
"Ross";"Can I use.. either thumb?"
"Rachel";"(carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!(Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an icedtea. I'm getting pretty good at this!"
"All";"Yeah. Yeah, excellent."
"Rachel";"(leaving to serve others) Good for me!"
"Joey";"Y'okay, Phoebe?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank."
"Monica";"What did they do to you?"
"Phoebe";"It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open uptheir monthly, you know, STATEMENT-"
"Ross";"Easy."
"Phoebe";"- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account."
"Chandler";"Oh, Satan's minions at work again..."
"Phoebe";"Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them."
"Joey";"What are you talking about? Keep it!"
"Phoebe";"It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be likestealing."
"Rachel";"Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!"
"Phoebe";"Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you knowwhat I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I washappy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine,not-not-mine'..."
"Monica";"We're with you. We got it."
"Phoebe";"Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like thisgiant karmic debt."
"Rachel";"Chandler, what are you doing?"
"Monica";"(puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?"
"All";"Oh! Oh, God!"
"Ross";"What is this?!"
"Chandler";"I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!"
"Chandler";"And this- is my reward!"
"Ross";"Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the lasttime you quit."
"Chandler";"Okay, so this time I won't quit!"
"All";"Ohhh! Put it out!"
"Chandler";"All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it inPhoebe's coffee.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!"
"Monica";"Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date."
"Rachel";"This Alan again? How's it goin'?"
"Monica";"'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun."
"Joey";"So when do we get to meet the guy?"
"Monica";"Let's see, today's Monday... Never."
"All";"Oh, come on! Come on!"
"Monica";"No. Not after what happened with Steve."
"Chandler";"What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!..Sorry."
"Monica";"Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chanceto figure that out."
"Rachel";"Well, then can we meet him?"
"Monica";"Nope. Schhorry."
"Monica";"I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, andwithin five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off theweak members of the herd."
"Paula";"Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'lltell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're justlooking out after you."
"Monica";"I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actuallyliked."
"Paula";"Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer ifthey never get to meet the guy.."
"Joey";"Let it go, Ross."
"Ross";"Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi."
"Monica";"Do you all promise?"
"All";"Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!"
"Monica";"(shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?"
"Joey";"You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!"
"Ross";"Hey, Pheebs."
"Phoebe";"'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We havecredited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, andhope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -"
"Rachel";"What bank is this?"
"Monica";"Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it?"
"Joey";"(shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here!"
"Monica";"(to all) Okay, please be good,"
"Monica";"Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan."
"Alan";"Hi."
"All";"Hi, Alan."
"Alan";"I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!"
"Monica";"(to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay.Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?"
"Monica";"C'mon!"
"Ross";"...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, Ican't do this, can't do this. We loved him."
"All";"Loved him! Yeah! He's great!"
"Monica";"Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that"
"All";"Yeah!"
"Rachel";"And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.)"
"Joey";"Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked."
"Phoebe";"Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!"
"Ross";"...What shoe?"
"Phoebe";"From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crookedsmile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'"
"Ross";"...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all futureboyfriends will be measured."
"Rachel";"What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it."
"Monica";"Really!"
"Chandler";"Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone.You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)"
"Ross";"You know what I like most about him, though?"
"All";"What?"
"Ross";"The way he makes me feel about myself."
"All";"Yeah..."
"Monica";"Hi.. how was the game?"
"Ross";"Well.."
"All";"WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!"
"Monica";"Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?"
"Joey";"Alan."
"Ross";"He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon whereBugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,second base-Alan, third base-..."
"Rachel";"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team."
"Chandler";"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two aboutsoftball.."
"Monica";"Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe..sometimes.."
"Ross";"What?"
"Monica";"..I dunno, a little too Alan?"
"Rachel";"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan."
"Ross";"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore."
"Chandler";"I personally could have a gallon of Alan."
"Phoebe";"Hey, Lizzie."
"Lizzie";"Hey, Weird Girl."
"Phoebe";"I brought you alphabet soup."
"Lizzie";"Did you pick out the vowels?"
"Phoebe";"Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh,I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.)"
"Lizzie";"Saltines?"
"Phoebe";"No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?"
"Lizzie";"What? (She opens the envelope Phoebe has given her.) Oh my God, there'sreally money in here."
"Phoebe";"I know."
"Lizzie";"Weird Girl, what are you doing?"
"Phoebe";"No, I want you to have it. I don't want it."
"Lizzie";"No, no, I ha-I have to give you something."
"Phoebe";"Oh, that's fine, no."
"Lizzie";"Would you like my tin-foil hat?"
"Phoebe";"No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks."
"Lizzie";"Please, let me do something."
"Phoebe";"Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?"
"Lizzie";"Okay."
"Phoebe";"Okay."
"Lizzie";"Keep the change. (To Phoebe) Sure you don't wanna pretzel?"
"Phoebe";"No, I'm fine."
"Lizzie";"(leaves) See ya."
"Phoebe";"Huh!"
"Ross";"A"
"All";"Eww!"
"Phoebe";"I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there,like this tiny little hitch-hiker!"
"Chandler";"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?"
"Phoebe";"Does, um, anyone wanna see?"
"All";"Nooo!"
"All";"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!"
"Rachel";"It's worse than the thumb!"
"Chandler";"Hey, this is so unfair!"
"Monica";"Oh, why is it unfair?"
"Chandler";"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-crackingisn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, withthat snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all thoseflaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
"Joey";"...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?"
"Rachel";"Well, I-I could live without it."
"Joey";"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews herhair?"
"Ross";"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
"Joey";"Oh, (Imitating Ross) "you do, do you"?"
"Ross";"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly."
"Rachel";""Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered."
"Rachel";"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on."
"Monica";"Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?"
"Paula";"No."
"Monica";"Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like."
"Paula";"Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow gotthrough!"
"Monica";"Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel"
"Paula";"Honey.. you should always feel"
"Monica";"I know.. it's gonna be really hard."
"Paula";"Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it."
"Monica";"No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about."
"Joey";"Do you have any respect for your body?"
"Ross";"Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?"
"Chandler";"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and youremphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
"Rachel";"(holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants tospeak to you."
"Chandler";"Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, shetold you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it'snot that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like thatbefore. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)"
"Rachel";"(to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good."
"Ross";"If only he were a woman."
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand forthirty years it'd be talking too."
"Ross";"Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.)"
"Monica";"(entering) Hey. Where's Joey?"
"Chandler";"Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that waswrong?"
"Rachel";"I think he's across the hall."
"Monica";"Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.)"
"Ross";"(finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go."
"Chandler";"(deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now."
"Ross";"Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?"
"Phoebe";"Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?"
"Ross";"Hey, I might!"
"Phoebe";"Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollarsfor the thumb."
"All";"You're kidding. Oh my God."
"Phoebe";"And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with theuniverse?!"
"Joey";"(dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's goingon?"
"Monica";"Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together."
"Joey";"Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.."
"Rachel";"Uh, Joey.."
"Joey";"Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.)"
"Monica";"(turns off the TV) Okay.."
"All";"Oh! That was Lambchop!"
"Monica";"Please, guys, we have to talk."
"Phoebe";"Wait, wait, I'm getting a"
"Monica";"Alright, we have to talk."
"Phoebe";"There it is!"
"Monica";"Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. Imean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan."
"Ross";"Is there somebody else?"
"Monica";"No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change."
"Rachel";"We didn't change.."
"Joey";"So that's it? It's over? Just like that?"
"Phoebe";"You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care aboutsomeone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair)"
"Monica";"Look, I- I could go on pretending-"
"Joey";"Okay!"
"Monica";"-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- Itwouldn't be fair to you!"
"Ross";"Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way theywere."
"Monica";"I'm sorry.."
"Chandler";"(sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!"
"Rachel";"(tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays comingup- I wanted him to meet my family-"
"Monica";"I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans."
"All";"Oh, yeah! Right!"
"Monica";"Are you guys gonna be okay?"
"Ross";"Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time."
"Monica";"(dubious) I understand."
"Alan";"Wow."
"Monica";"I'm, I'm really sorry."
"Alan";"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved."
"Monica";"Relieved?"
"Alan";"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends."
"Rachel";"Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun."
"Ross";"Yeah. He could row like a viking."
"Monica";"(entering) Hi."
"All";"Mmm."
"Ross";"So how'd it go?"
"Monica";"Oh, y'know.."
"Phoebe";"Did he mention us?"
"Monica";"He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look)"
"Ross";"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes herforehead.)"
"Chandler";"...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes."
"All";"No no no!"
"Chandler";"(leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I'vegotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!"
"Phoebe";"(shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seventhousand dollars!"
"Monica";"Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal."
"Ross";"Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there'sone little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'mconcerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?"
"Rachel";"Come on! You guys can pee standing up."
"Chandler";"We can? All right, I'm tryin' that."
"Joey";"Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want.You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me."
"Phoebe";"Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many meanthings, and then not even care."
"Ross";"Multiple orgasms!"
"Chandler";"So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night,Sat-ur-day night!"
"Joey";"No plans, huh?"
"Chandler";"Not a one."
"Ross";"Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?"
"Chandler";"Oh, right, right, shut up."
"Monica";"Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it."
"Chandler";"No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sittingthere with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courageto do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."
"Joey";"Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling."
"Phoebe";"You know, if you want, I'll do it with you."
"Chandler";"Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her."
"Phoebe";"No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony."
"Ross";"Tony?"
"Monica";"Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? Idon't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know."
"Rachel";"(waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?"
"Ross";"Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakeypie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine."
"Phoebe";"(to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?"
"Rachel";"It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible."
"Ross";"That guy, he burns me up."
"Rachel";"Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. Hecalled me"
"Chandler";"Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that."
"Monica";"Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thingagain?"
"Rachel";"Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with threechoruses of "You'll never make it on your own"."
"Phoebe";"(rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh."
"Angela";"Hi, Joey."
"Joey";"My god, Angela."
"Monica";"Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her."
"Phoebe";"Are you gonna go over there?"
"Joey";"No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. OneMississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over toher) Hey, Angela."
"Angela";"(casually) Joey."
"Joey";"You look good."
"Angela";"That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs."
"Joey";"You don't say."
"Ross";"So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?"
"Rachel";"Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama."
"Ross";"Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundrythere too?"
"Rachel";"Who?"
"Ross";"Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join youboth, here?"
"Rachel";"Don't you have a laundry room in your building?"
"Ross";"Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... ratproblem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, butthey're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?"
"Rachel";"Sure."
"Angela";"Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now."
"Joey";"Bob? Who the hell's Bob?"
"Angela";"Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job.You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob..."
"Joey";"Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like,talking too."
"Angela";"Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?"
"Joey";"What?"
"Angela";"We're just friends."
"Joey";"Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner togethertonight? You know, as friends?"
"Angela";"What four of us?"
"Joey";"You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica."
"Joey";"Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you."
"Monica";"Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet."
"Joey";"Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He'ssmart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month andcall myself an actor, but Bob is..."
"Monica";"(looking out window) Oh, god help us."
"Joey";"What?"
"Monica";"Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!"
"Joey";"Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybeAngela will come back to me."
"Monica";"What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls."
"Joey";"(proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken upwith her. Will you help me? Please?"
"Ross";"(on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonnabe me and Rachel."
"Chandler";"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thingthrough?"
"Ross";"It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal."
"Chandler";"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You'regoing on a date."
"Ross";"Nuh-uh."
"Chandler";"Yuh-huh."
"Ross";"So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"
"Chandler";"Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically thefirst time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?"
"Ross";"(sheepish) No."
"Chandler";"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?"
"Ross";"Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my"
"Chandler";"There you go."
"Monica";"Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?"
"Joey";"Yep."
"Monica";"Which?"
"Joey";"Which what?"
"Monica";"You've never met Bob, have you?"
"Joey";"No, but he's..."
"Monica";"Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly..."
"Angela";"Hey, Joey."
"Monica";"...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now."
"Chandler";"Where are they? Where are they?"
"Phoebe";"This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us."
"Chandler";"It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over somepuppies."
"Phoebe";"Eww, I don't wanna do that."
"Chandler";"Here we go."
"Phoebe";"Ok, have a good break-up."
"Chandler";"Hey, Janice."
"Janice";"Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awfulday."
"Chandler";"Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here,please?"
"Janice";"We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with thelittle vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day,and I went shopping...(looks through her bags)... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking,I'm looking, I got you..."
"Chandler";"What?"
"Janice";"What?"
"Chandler";"(covering) What... did you get me there?"
"Janice";"I got you...these. (pulls out a pair of socks)"
"Chandler";"Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet."
"Janice";"Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you canwear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match,moose and squirrel. Whatever you want."
"Chandler";"That's great."
"Chandler";"Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"
"Janice";"(holding the full cup) No, no, I'm still working on mine."
"Chandler";"That's it?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, it was really hard."
"Chandler";"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
"Phoebe";"Ok, you weren't there."
"Woman";"Comin' through. Move, move."
"Rachel";"Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine."
"Woman";"Yeah, well, now you're kinda not."
"Rachel";"But I saved it. I put my basket on top."
"Woman";"Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, Idon't see suds."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Woman";"No suds, no save. Ok?"
"Ross";"What's goin' on?"
"Rachel";"Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine."
"Ross";"Was your basket on top?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, but, there were no suds."
"Ross";"So?"
"Rachel";"Well, you know, no suds, no save."
"Ross";"No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend'smachine."
"Woman";"Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it."
"Ross";"Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it."
"Ross";"(to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to seehere. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry."
"Rachel";"That was amazing. I can't even send back soup."
"Ross";"Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, doyou...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent."
"Rachel";"What's that?"
"Ross";"Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?"
"Rachel";"Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposedto use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?"
"Ross";"Rach, have you never done this before?"
"Rachel";"Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me.I'm a laundry virgin."
"Ross";"Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically youwanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a thirdfor your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things."
"Rachel";"(holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about theseare white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?"
"Ross";"(visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call."
"Monica";"(to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys growup?"
"Angela";"Brooklyn Heights."
"Bob";"Cleveland."
"Monica";"How, how did that happen?"
"Joey";"Oh my god."
"Monica";"What?"
"Joey";"I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not."
"Joey";"So, you and Angela, huh?"
"Bob";"Yep. Pretty much."
"Joey";"You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cutenibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."
"Bob";"Huh, I never really noticed."
"Joey";"Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it."
"Bob";"Monica, Monica is great."
"Joey";"Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually."
"Monica";"I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific."
"Angela";"Yeah, isn't he?"
"Monica";"It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has anemotional age beyond, like eight."
"Angela";"You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed."
"Monica";"Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity."
"Angela";"Huh. That's nice."
"Phoebe";"Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do itreally fast, and then the wound is exposed."
"Chandler";"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go outanymore. Janice."
"Janice";"All right. Well, there you go. (she gets extremely wound up, and beginsto try and calm herself down) Stop it, stop it, stop it."
"Rachel";"Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I cando this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do."
"Ross";"That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I hadto make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'msorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh."
"Rachel";"What uh-oh?"
"Ross";"(not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it'sa song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
"Rachel";"Ross, what's the matter?"
"Ross";"Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done."
"Rachel";"Come on, show me."
"Ross";"All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all yourwhites, and now, everything's kinda pink."
"Rachel";"Oh, everything's pink."
"Ross";"Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, pleasedon't be upset, it could happen to anyone."
"Rachel";"Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a bigmarshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on myown! I can't even do laundry!"
"Monica";"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head toinflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm justthinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, couldwe check it in the light, please?"
"Monica";"Oh my god."
"Joey";"What?"
"Monica";"Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia."
"Joey";"Come on, they're close."
"Monica";"Close? She's got her tongue in his ear."
"Joey";"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."
"Monica";"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, isit?"
"Joey";"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."
"Monica";"Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
"Joey";"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
"Monica";"(hits him lightly) Oh!"
"Joey";"Ow!"
"Monica";"(leaving) I'm outta here."
"Joey";"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you."
"Monica";"Really?"
"Joey";"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us,we can break them up."
"Monica";"I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughingat your Norman Mailer story."
"Joey";"Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here."
"Chandler";"Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different.I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand outand hits Janice in the eye)... boom."
"Janice";"Ow!"
"Chandler";"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
"Janice";"Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back."
"Chandler";"(to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is theworst break-up in the history of the world."
"Phoebe";"Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have youhad?"
"Chandler";"Oh, I don't know, a million?"
"Phoebe";"Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la."
"Chandler";"I'm fine."
"Phoebe";"All right."
"Chandler";"I'm not fine. Here she comes."
"Phoebe";"Wait here. Breathe."
"Chandler";"How do you do that?"
"Phoebe";"It's like a gift."
"Chandler";"We should always always break up together."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I'd like that."
"Ross";"You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part."
"Rachel";"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now."
"Rachel";"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart."
"Woman";"Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, getoutta my way."
"Rachel";"I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart."
"Woman";"Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it."
"Rachel";"Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!"
"Woman";"Let go!"
"Rachel";"All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have totake me with it!"
"Rachel";"(to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?"
"Ross";"You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
"Rachel";"I could not have done this without you."
"Ross";"Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head onan open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine."
"Rachel";"Are you sure?"
"Ross";"No."
"Rachel";"Oh, are you sure you're ok?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Does it still hurt?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"(seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'mgonna do this."
"Monica";"Hi."
"Phoebe";"Hey, how'd it go?"
"Joey";"Excellent."
"Monica";"We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves."
"Ross";"What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way."
"Monica";"(notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry."
"Rachel";"Where's Chandler?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, he needed some time to grieve."
"Chandler";"I'm free! I'm free!"
"Phoebe";"That oughta do it."
"Rachel";"(reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey'spicture! This is so exciting!"
"Chandler";"You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before.Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom..."
"Phoebe";"The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it'snot just"
"Ross";"Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen."
"Joey";"Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say,your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)"
"Rachel";"God. I feel violated."
"Monica";"Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body,to have something else to do?"
"Chandler";"(staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock."
"Ross";"Is it? Feels like two."
"Chandler";"No,"
"Ross";"What?"
"Chandler";"(sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight,nine, ten o'clock!"
"Ross";"Oh. Hel-lo!"
"Chandler";"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short,fat, bald men!"
"Monica";"Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone."
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me.Blarrglarrghh.'"
"Rachel";"Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!"
"Chandler";"Oh please, could she"
"Ross";"He could never get a woman like that in a million years."
"Chandler";"Thank you, buddy."
"Phoebe";"Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women withthese really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys."
"Monica";"You could do that!"
"Chandler";"Y'think?"
"All";"Yeah!"
"Chandler";"Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very veryaware of my tongue..."
"Ross";"C'mon! C'mon!"
"Chandler";"Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)"
"Aurora";"...Yes?"
"Chandler";"Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is myname, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi."
"Aurora";"Yes, you said that."
"Chandler";"Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say,what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou,goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.)"
"Aurora";"Chandler?"
"All";"Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!"
"Joey";"Whadja think?"
"All";"...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!"
"Joey";"C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I didwith the trolls, at least you got to see my head."
"All";"(admitting) Saw your head. Saw your head."
"Chandler";"(running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play,man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, theusher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)"
"Rachel";"What is it?"
"Joey";"The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybethey wanna sign me!"
"Phoebe";"Based on"
"Chandler";"Hey, kids."
"All";"Hey."
"Phoebe";"(reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is...just a line."
"Chandler";"Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and youhaven't asked me how my date went."
"Monica";"Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?"
"Chandler";"It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had themost amazing life! She was in the Israeli army..."
"Chandler";"Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and Irode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it."
"Chandler";"Chandler:"
"Chandler";"Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?"
"Aurora";"'We' would be me and Rick."
"Joey";"Joey:"
"Aurora";"My husband."
"All";"All:"
"Aurora";"No."
"Chandler";"Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?"
"Aurora";"No, I'm still married."
"Chandler";"So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about yousitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the changein my pocket?"
"Aurora";"Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okaywith Ethan."
"Chandler";"Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?"
"Aurora";"Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend."
"All";"All:"
"Aurora";"I suppose mainly sexual."
"Chandler";"...Hm."
"Monica";"Monica:"
"Chandler";"What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't youlisten to the story?"
"Monica";"Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could youget involved with a woman like this?"
"Chandler";"Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way Ilook at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and"
"Phoebe";"Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?"
"Ross";"No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is."
"Monica";"What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going outwith someone else?"
"Joey";"I couldn't do it."
"Monica";"Good for you, Joey."
"Joey";"When I'm with a woman, I need to"
"Ross";"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean,anthropologically speaking-"
"Ross";"Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know."
"Monica";"We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!"
"All";"Yeah! C'mon!"
"Ross";"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-"
"Rachel";"Tah-daaah!"
"Chandler";"Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that."
"Rachel";"Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used allthe attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don'tknow what that's for."
"Ross";"Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask."
"Rachel";"Well, whaddya think?"
"All";"Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!"
"Monica";"...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman."
"All";"Uh-oh..."
"Monica";"How-how did that happen?"
"Rachel";"I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's anextra seat around the coffee table."
"Monica";"Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's seewhat it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see.Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while."
"Phoebe";"(to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman."
"Chandler";"Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'llscratch your eyes right out."
"Monica";"You guys, I am not that bad!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, alittle, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!"
"Monica";"That is so unfair!"
"Ross";"Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll thatwasn't raggedy!"
"Monica";"Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook."
"Ross";"Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, butyou don't pay it right away."
"Monica";"Why not?"
"Ross";"Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice."
"Monica";"I could do that."
"Rachel";"Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent,but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout."
"Monica";"Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder."
"Chandler";"Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's acold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer andcloser to the surface of the wood..."
"Monica";"STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?"
"Ross";"Monica? You're Mom."
"Phoebe";"Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!"
"Joey";"(on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (Hehangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent hasjust gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!"
"All";"Oh my God! Whoah!"
"Monica";"Well, what's the part?"
"Joey";"Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor!"I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out oforder!""
"Phoebe";"Seriously, what-what's the part?"
"Joey";""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!""
"Ross";"C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?"
"Joey";"...I'm his (mumbles)"
"Rachel";"..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?"
"Joey";"...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goesinto the shower, and then- I'm his butt."
"Monica";"(trying not to laugh) Oh my God."
"Joey";"C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that'sbig!"
"Chandler";"Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, afterall your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way intoshowbusiness."
"Joey";"Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!"
"Ross";"You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the bigopening?"
"Monica";"Alright, alright, alright..."
"Joey";"Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer."
"Monica";"For what?"
"Joey";"Whaddya think? Today's the big day!"
"Monica";"Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don'tever tell me what you did in there."
"Joey";"Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)"
"Chandler";"Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone."
"Monica";"He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!"
"Chandler";"C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runsback out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!"
"Monica";"I warned you..."
"Rachel";"Who is being loud?"
"Chandler";"Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things,Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast."
"Monica";"Oh, you got the whole night, huh?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (Hestarts to raid the fridge.)"
"Rachel";"Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?"
"Chandler";"No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in arelationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of yourlife? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted aboutthirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?(He has armloads of stuff.)"
"Monica";"Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remindyou to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that."
"Joey";"Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity."
"Director";"Lose the robe."
"Joey";"Me?"
"Director";"That would work."
"Joey";"Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe islost."
"Director";"Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's rollit.. water's working (The shower starts).. and... action."
"Director";"And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?"
"Joey";"Well, I'm- I'm showering."
"Director";"No, that was clenching."
"Joey";"Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, hiswife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here."
"Director";"I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again,rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?"
"Joey";"I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask..."
"Chandler";"God, I love these fingers..."
"Aurora";"Thank you."
"Chandler";"No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy theyare."
"Aurora";"(moves Chandler's arm and look at his watch.) Oh my God, I'm late. (Shestarts to get up.)"
"Chandler";"Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls herback down.)"
"Aurora";"Okay."
"Chandler";"Don't go."
"Aurora";"Okay. Oh no, I have to."
"Chandler";"(to himself) Too bad, she's leaving."
"Aurora";"(getting up and dressing) I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me."
"Chandler";"Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick."
"Aurora";"It's not Rick."
"Chandler";"What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!"
"Aurora";"No, it's-it's Andrew."
"Chandler";"I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regretasking the following question, but- And Andrew is?"
"Aurora";"He's... new."
"Chandler";"Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick,Ethan and myself?"
"Aurora";"No, that's not exactly what I was.."
"Chandler";"Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us."
"Aurora";"So what do you want?"
"Chandler";"You."
"Aurora";"You have me!"
"Chandler";"Nono, just you."
"Aurora";"Whaddyou mean?"
"Chandler";"Lose the other guys."
"Aurora";"...Like, ...all of them?"
"Chandler";"C'mon, we're great together, why not?"
"Aurora";"Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, andlaugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight Ithought that's what you wanted too."
"Chandler";"...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys,y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy.Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizesand breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out!Get out!'"
"Aurora";"So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?"
"Chandler";"I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactlylet each other finish..."
"Aurora";"Which one?"
"Chandler";"...The second guy."
"Aurora";"(gets up to leave) Well, call me if you change your mind."
"Chandler";"Sorry, the first guy runs the lips."
"Ross";"Look at it this way:"
"All";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new AlPacino movie?"
"Joey";"Nope."
"Ross";"No? What happened, big guy?"
"Chandler";"(to Ross) "Big guy?""
"Ross";"It felt like a 'big guy' moment."
"Joey";"I got fired."
"All";"Oh!"
"Joey";"Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Noweverybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and..."
"Rachel";"Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell."
"Joey";"My mom will."
"Chandler";"Something so sweet and...disturbing about that."
"Joey";"Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finallyget my shot, and I blow it!"
"Monica";"Maybe this wasn't your shot."
"Ross";"Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it'syour shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?"
"Joey";"Hard to tell, I was naked."
"Phoebe";"No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think youjust get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You'vegotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'."
"Joey";"Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)"
"Monica";"I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys."
"All";"Night."
"Rachel";"Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?"
"Monica";"(determined) Uh-huh!"
"Rachel";"Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?"
"Monica";"Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to herroom.)"
"Ross";"She"
"Rachel";"Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the musicof Miss Phoebe Buffay."
"Phoebe";"Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when yousuddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lightsgo out) OK, thank you very much."
"Chandler";"Oh,"
"Rachel";"Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!"
"Monica";"Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and theyhave no idea when it's coming back on."
"Rachel";"Wow, you guys, this is big."
"Monica";"(into phone) Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in ablackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. (hangsup)"
"Phoebe";"Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on mygrandma. (to Monica) What's my number?"
"Phoebe";"Well, I never call"
"Jill";"Jill:"
"Jill";"(on phone) Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATMvestibule."
"Jill";"(on phone) I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy."
"Joey";"Hi everyone."
"Ross";"And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani."
"Joey";"Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles wehave, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone."
"Phoebe";"(at window) Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles."
"Rachel";"That had to hurt!"
"Jill";"(awkwardly) Would you like to call somebody? (offering phone)"
"Monica";"Hello?"
"Chandler";"Hey, it's me."
"Monica";"(to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in anATM vstbl wth"
"Monica";"What?"
"Chandler";"I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth"
"Monica";"I have no idea what you just said."
"Chandler";"(angry) Put Joey on the phone."
"Joey";"What's up man?"
"Chandler";"I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth"
"Joey";"(to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with JillGoodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)"
"Chandler";"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind."
"Rachel";"Alright, somebody."
"Monica";"OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table."
"All";"Whoooaa!"
"Ross";"That's my sister."
"Joey";"OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the secondfloor of the New York CIty public library."
"Monica";"Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?"
"Ross";"Pheebs, what about you?"
"Phoebe";"Oh... Milwaukee."
"Rachel";"Um... Ross?"
"Ross";"Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'"
"All";"No way!"
"Ross";"The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of thosemechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to returnto the Magic Kingdom."
"Phoebe";"Oh, Rachel."
"Rachel";"Oh come on, I already went."
"Monica";"You did not go!"
"All";"Come on."
"Rachel";"Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, thefoot of the bed."
"Ross";"Step back."
"Joey";"We have a winner!"
"Rachel";"I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know,where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park."
"Ross";"Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line."
"Rachel";"There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golfcourse."
"Ross";"Come on."
"Rachel";"No, he said we were holding up the people behind us."
"Ross";"(sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?"
"Rachel";"I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never havingthat kind of..."
"Ross";"Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated."
"Rachel";"Yeah right."
"Ross";"It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you'releft with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So,you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all thatother good stuff."
"Rachel";"(sigh) OK."
"Ross";"But, um... I don't think that's going to be you."
"Rachel";"You don't."
"Ross";"Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future."
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Ross";"Mmmm."
"Rachel";"You do?"
"Ross";"I do."
"Rachel";"Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)"
"Joey";"It's never gonna happen."
"Ross";"(innocently) What?"
"Joey";"You and Rachel."
"Ross";"(acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?"
"Joey";"Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the"
"Ross";"No, no, no. I'm not in the zone."
"Joey";"Ross, you're mayor of the zone."
"Ross";"I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean,every day I get just a little bit closer to..."
"Joey";"Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you'rethinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever."
"Ross";"I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him)What? What, now?"
"Joey";"Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight?You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into theroom behind them)"
"Ross";"Shhhh!"
"Rachel";"What are you shushing?"
"Ross";"We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.(everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?"
"Rachel";"Ahhhh!"
"Ross";"See?"
"Rachel";"Huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)"
"Jill";"Would you like some gum?"
"Chandler";"Um, is it sugarless?"
"Jill";"(checks) Sorry, it's not."
"Chandler";"Oh, then no thanks."
"Phoebe";"(singing) New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. Butto me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (shewrites the lyrics down)"
"Ross";"(to Joey) OK, here goes."
"Joey";"Are you going to do it?"
"Ross";"I'm going to do it."
"Joey";"Do you want any help?"
"Ross";"You come out there, you're a dead man."
"Joey";"Good luck, man."
"Ross";"Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK."
"Joey";"OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel)"
"Joey";"Hey, where are you going?"
"Monica";"Outside."
"Joey";"You can't go out there."
"Monica";"Why not?"
"Joey";"Because of... the reason."
"Monica";"And that would be?"
"Joey";"I, um, can't tell you."
"Monica";"Joey, what's going on?"
"Joey";"OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I toldyou."
"Monica";"About what?"
"Joey";"He's planning your birthday party."
"Monica";"Oh my God! I love him!"
"Joey";"(as Phoebe enters) You'd better act surprised."
"Phoebe";"About what?"
"Monica";"My surprise party!"
"Phoebe";"What surprise party?"
"Monica";"Oh stop it. Joey already told me."
"Phoebe";"Well, he didn't tell me."
"Joey";"Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing."
"Phoebe";"This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything."
"Monica";"No, you are not. We tell you stuff."
"Phoebe";"Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by thepeacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he wasmoving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Lookslike I was second to last."
"Rachel";"Hmmm... this is so nice."
"Ross";"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..more of a general wondering... ment."
"Rachel";"OK."
"Ross";"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
"Rachel";"Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)"
"Ross";"Yes, yes, that's right..."
"Rachel";"Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)"
"Ross";"What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!"
"Monica";"(to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt."
"Joey";"Sorry, that was wax."
"Phoebe";"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner."
"Ross";"Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?"
"Rachel";"During a blackout? He'd get trampled!"
"Ross";"(nonchalantly) Yeah?"
"Chandler";"You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives hima stick of gum, and a strange look)"
"Phoebe";"(stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things,right?"
"Rachel";"Oh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just foundthis cat and we're looking for the owner."
"Mr. Heckles";"Er, yeah, it's mine."
"Phoebe";"(trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are yousure?"
"Mr. Heckles";"Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat."
"Phoebe";"Wait a minute. What's his name?"
"Mr. Heckles";"Ehhhh... B-Buttons."
"Rachel";"Bob Buttons?"
"Mr. Heckles";"Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons."
"Phoebe";"(the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man!"
"Mr. Heckles";"(as Phoebe and Rachel leave) You owe me a cat."
"Rachel";"Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, littlekitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty..."
"Rachel";"Wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)"
"Ross";"(rolling) Lucky sixes...."
"Rachel";"(entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, Iwant you to meet my friends. This is Monica."
"Monica";"(smitten) Hi!"
"Rachel";"And Joey...."
"Monica";"Hi!"
"Rachel";"And Ross."
"Monica";"Hi!"
"Rachel";"(proudly) He doesn't speak much English."
"Rachel";"Look at that!"
"Ross";"(jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?"
"Rachel";"Oh... Italy, I think."
"Ross";"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives."
"Rachel";"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!"
"Ross";"That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him."
"Phoebe";"Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kittyanywhere."
"Rachel";"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat."
"Phoebe";"Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... sincenobody told me... this is Paolo."
"Rachel";"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe."
"Phoebe";"(smiling) You betcha!"
"Chandler";"(chewing gum)"
"Jill";"Are you alright?"
"Jill";"My God, you're choking! (she runs over and gives him the Heimlich, the gumflies from his mouth) That better?"
"Chandler";"(gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was...."
"Jill";"Perfection?"
"Ross";"(mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah...."
"Ross";"Wha-What did he say that was so funny?"
"Rachel";"I have absolutely no idea."
"Ross";"That's... that's classic."
"Rachel";"(to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am Idoing? This is so un-me!"
"Monica";"If you want, I'll do it."
"Phoebe";"I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But Iwon't."
"Rachel";"God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were moreexciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry."
"Phoebe";"You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... (they stare ather)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK."
"Rachel";"Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothingin common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd...."
"Ross";"Paolo. Hi."
"Ross";"Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I...we're kind of a thing."
"Ross";"Thing, yes. Thing."
"Ross";"No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see,that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together.You know, and if you get in the.... um..."
"Ross";"No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the..."
"Ross";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"So you do know a little English."
"Ross";"Do you know the word"
"Ross";"That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!"
"Jill";"Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy."
"Chandler";"OK."
"Jill";"Ready? (she swings the pen around her head in a circle)"
"Jill";"No, you've got to whip it."
"Phoebe";"Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...(time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... (someone blows it out, the roomgets completely dark)"
"Ross";"Thank you."
"Phoebe";"Thanks."
"Ross";"Kinda... spooky without any lights."
"Joey";"(does a maniacal laugh) Bwah-hah-hah!"
"Ross";"OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah..."
"Ross";"Oh.. oh... oh."
"Joey";"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you haveto throw a party for Monica."
"Jill";"Well, this has been fun."
"Chandler";"Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving mylife."
"Jill";"Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. (she kisses him on thecheek) See ya."
"Chandler";"Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you gotany of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape."
"Chandler";"Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it"
"Shelley";"Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebodywho would be perfect for you."
"Chandler";"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or'self-destructive'..."
"Shelley";"Do you want a date Saturday?"
"Chandler";"Yes please."
"Shelley";"Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-"
"Chandler";"He's a he?"
"Shelley";"Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonnago flush myself down the toilet now...(backs out of the room) Okay, goodbye..."
"Chandler";"...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is thatridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?"
"Rachel";"Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe,possibly, you might be..."
"Chandler";"You did?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to mybreasts, so then I figured maybe not."
"Chandler";"Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you firstmet me?"
"Monica";"I did."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I think so, yeah."
"Joey";"Not me."
"Ross";"Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidordid."
"Chandler";"You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?"
"Ross";"No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so Itold her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so..."
"Chandler";"Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?"
"Phoebe";"I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny..."
"Chandler";"Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"
"All";"Yeah! Right!"
"Chandler";"WHAT IS IT?!"
"Monica";"Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality."
"All";"Yes. Absolutely. A quality."
"Chandler";"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna bevague about this."
"Monica";"Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone)"
"Ross";"(to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go toRome."
"Rachel";"Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking toRome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome."
"Monica";"Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana."
"Ross";"So, uh, how's she doing?"
"Aunt Lillian";"The doctor says it's a matter of hours."
"Monica";"How-how are you, Mom?"
"Mrs. Geller";"Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?"
"Monica";"What?"
"Mrs. Geller";"What's different?"
"Monica";"Nothing."
"Mrs. Geller";"Oh, maybe that's it."
"Monica";"She is unbelievable, our mother is..."
"Ross";"Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, andwe still have boyfriends and your career to cover."
"Monica";"Oh God!"
"Monica";"The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse."
"Ross";"Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n'Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants."
"Mr. Geller";"Not just restaurants, from our house."
"Nurse";"Mrs. Geller?"
"Ross";"She looks so small."
"Monica";"I know."
"Ross";"Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now."
"Monica";"G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)"
"Ross";"Bye, Nana."
"Monica";"Ross!"
"Mrs. Geller";"What is going on?!"
"Ross";"Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not,quite.."
"Mrs. Geller";"What?"
"Ross";"She's not- past, she's present, she's back."
"Aunt Lillian";"(reentering) What's going on?"
"Mr. Geller";"She may have died."
"Aunt Lillian";"She"
"Mr. Geller";"We're looking into it."
"Ross";"I, uh, I'll go see. (He goes in)"
"Nurse";"This almost never happens!"
"Chandler";"I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?"
"Rachel";"(exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, you have homosexual hair."
"Rachel";"So, um, did she..."
"Ross";"Twice."
"Joey";"Twice?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, that sucks!"
"Joey";"You guys okay?"
"Ross";"I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel,uh..."
"Phoebe";"Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone."
"Ross";"Nono, she's gone."
"Monica";"We checked. A lot."
"Phoebe";"Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, everynow and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her handaround her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! AndDebbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golfcourse- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those littleyellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her."
"Rachel";"Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)"
"Phoebe";"Thanks!"
"Rachel";"Sure. I just sharpened her this morning."
"Joey";"Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you'redead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay,huh?"
"Phoebe";"Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back thepencil)"
"Ross";"I thought it was gonna be a closed casket."
"Mrs. Geller";"Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!"
"Mrs. Geller";"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?"
"Ross";"(sarcastic) I don't see why not."
"Ross";"Here's my retainer!"
"Mr. Geller";"I was just thinking. When my time comes-"
"Monica";"Dad!"
"Mr. Geller";"Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea."
"Monica";"You what?"
"Mr. Geller";"I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun."
"Monica";"Define fun."
"Mr. Geller";"C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch..."
"Monica";"...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun."
"Mr. Geller";"Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, sopredictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'."
"Monica";"That's probably what they'll say."
"Mr. Geller";"I'd like that."
"Chandler";"Hey, gorgeous."
"Shelley";"(sheepish) Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-"
"Chandler";"No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently otherpeople have made the same mistake."
"Shelley";"Oh! Okay! Phew!"
"Chandler";"So, uh... what do you think it is about me?"
"Shelley";"I dunno, uh... you just have a-a..."
"Chandler";"...Quality, right, great."
"Shelley";"Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a greatcouple."
"Chandler";"Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?"
"Shelley";"What? He's cute!"
"Chandler";"Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll."
"Shelley";"Is Brian...?"
"Chandler";"No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up withsomeone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him."
"Shelley";"Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league."
"Chandler";"Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could"
"Ross";"(holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?"
"Aunt Lillian";"No."
"Ross";"I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spendeternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy."
"Aunt Lillian";"You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrongone."
"Mrs. Geller";"You're right. We'll go with the burgundy."
"Ross";"Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)"
"Aunt Lillian";"Wait! We need shoes!"
"Ross";"Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)"
"Mrs. Geller";"That's really a day shoe."
"Ross";"And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?"
"Aunt Lillian";"Could we see something in a slimmer heel?"
"Ross";"(forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.I can show you something in a silver that may work."
"Aunt Lillian";"No, it really should be burgundy."
"Mrs. Geller";"Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?"
"Ross";"No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back."
"Ross";"Oh my God.."
"Mrs. Geller";"Is everything all right, dear?"
"Ross";"Yeah, just... just Nana stuff."
"Ross";"(entering) How we doing, you guys ready?"
"Monica";"Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Didyou know my ears are not my best feature?"
"Ross";"Some days it's all I can think about."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings."
"Rachel";"Oh, you-you mean your earrings?"
"Phoebe";"What'd I say?"
"Rachel";"(sticking her foot out) Hm-m."
"Monica";"Are these the shoes?"
"Rachel";"Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy."
"Ross";"What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?"
"Joey";"(entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?"
"Chandler";"Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn'tit?"
"Monica";"It was a really beautiful service."
"Mrs. Geller";"It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. (Hugs her) Y'know, I thinkit might be time for you to start using night cream."
"Joey";"What?"
"Chandler";"Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger."
"Joey";"Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)"
"Chandler";"You're watching a football game at a funeral?"
"Joey";"No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception."
"Chandler";"You are a frightening, frightening man."
"Rachel";"Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!"
"Ross";"Oh, I hope they're not ruined."
"Phoebe";"God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!"
"Ross";"I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's,there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going hefalls into an open grave)"
"All";"God! Ross!"
"Ross";"I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised..."
"Phoebe";"Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's inspasm...huh."
"Ross";"What, what is it?"
"Phoebe";"You missed a belt loop."
"Ross";"Oh! No-n-"
"Phoebe";"Okay, it's in spasm."
"Mrs. Geller";"Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.(Hands Ross a bottle of pills. Then turns to Monica and pats her hair over her ears)"
"Chandler";"Oh, no-"
"Andrea";"Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter."
"Chandler";"Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is."
"Phoebe";"Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?"
"Ross";"I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great."
"Monica";"Wow, those pills really worked, huh?"
"Ross";"Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guysare the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)"
"Phoebe";"Ooh! That's so nice..."
"Ross";"...Chandler!"
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Ross";"(hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter tome."
"Andrea";"(turns to a friend) You were right. (They walk off and leave Chandler.)"
"Ross";"Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most."
"Rachel";"(humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?"
"Ross";"No."
"Rachel";"You!"
"Ross";"Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)"
"Mr. Geller";"Whaddya got there?"
"Joey";"(hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearingdisability."
"Mr. Geller";"What's the score?"
"Joey";"Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third."
"Mr. Geller";"Beautiful! (Turns to watch with him)"
"Rachel";"(still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?"
"Mrs. Geller";"(to Monica) Your grandmother would have hated this."
"Monica";"Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all."
"Mrs. Geller";"No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?',I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wastingyour money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'."
"Monica";"That sounds like Nana."
"Mrs. Geller";"Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is criticalof every single thing you say?"
"Monica";"...I can imagine."
"Mrs. Geller";"I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be thepositive, life-affirming person that she is."
"Monica";"That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it allover again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?"
"Mrs. Geller";"Tell her what?"
"Monica";"How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like yourhair... for example."
"Mrs. Geller";"I'm not sure I know what you're getting at."
"Monica";"Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her thetruth?"
"Mrs. Geller";"...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it'snicer when people just get along."
"Monica";"Huh."
"Mrs. Geller";"More wine, dear?"
"Monica";"Oh, I think so."
"Mrs. Geller";"(reaches out to fiddle with Monica's hair again, and realises)Those earrings look really lovely on you."
"Monica";"Thank you. They're yours."
"Mrs. Geller";"Actually they were Nana's."
"Mr. Geller";"Now I'm depressed! ...(To everyone) Even more than I was."
"Rachel";"Hey, who's this little naked guy?"
"Ross";"That little naked guy would be me."
"Rachel";"Aww, look at the little thing."
"Ross";"Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?"
"Chandler";"Who are those people?"
"Ross";"Got me."
"Monica";"Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and thegang at Java Joe's'."
"Rachel";"Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?"
"Monica";"Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
"Ross";"Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)"
"Joey";"Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!"
"Ross";"(looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something."
"Chandler";"Hey, Lowell."
"Lowell";"Hey, Chandler."
"Chandler";"So how's it going there in Financial Services?"
"Lowell";"It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?"
"Chandler";"Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but,uh... I'm not."
"Lowell";"I know. That's what I told her."
"Chandler";"Really."
"Lowell";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"So- you can tell?"
"Lowell";"Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar."
"Chandler";"So you don't think I have a, a quality?"
"Lowell";"Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friendBrian from Payroll, he is."
"Chandler";"He"
"Lowell";"Yup, and waaay out of your league. (Exits)"
"Rachel";"Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I waswondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?"
"Terry";"An advance?"
"Rachel";"It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year wego skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started thewhole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job."
"Terry";"Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really,really awful."
"Rachel";"Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'mtrying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?(everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that."
"Rachel";"Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, doyou think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?"
"Rachel";"Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.(picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go."
"Monica";"Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico forThanksgiving?"
"Ross";"No, they're not."
"Monica";"Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them."
"Ross";"You're wrong."
"Monica";"I am not wrong."
"Ross";"You're wrong."
"Monica";"No, I just talked to them."
"Ross";"(getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom."
"Joey";"Hey, hey."
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Phoebe";"Hey."
"Chandler";"And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?"
"Joey";"Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model."
"Chandler";"That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like JoeyTribbiani, man slash woman."
"Phoebe";"What were you modeling for?"
"Joey";"You know those posters for the city free clinic?"
"Monica";"Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthyguys"?"
"Phoebe";"You know, the asthma guy was really cute."
"Chandler";"Do you know which one you're gonna be?"
"Joey";"No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)"
"Chandler";"Good luck, man. I hope you get it."
"Joey";"Thanks."
"Ross";"(to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It'sThanksgiving."
"Monica";"Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll makeit just like Mom's."
"Ross";"Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?"
"Monica";"You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at hersheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Monica";"And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrimholidays."
"Chandler";"Yes, every single one of them."
"Monica";"Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?"
"Phoebe";"Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December'cause he is lunar."
"Monica";"So you're free Thursday, then."
"Phoebe";"Yeah. Oh, can I come?"
"Monica";"Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?"
"Rachel";"Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go."
"Chandler";"I thought it was $98.50."
"Rachel";"Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup."
"Ross";"Well, I'm off to Carol's."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?"
"Ross";"(mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want tobring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner."
"Ross";"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?"
"Susan";"No, she's at a faculty meeting."
"Ross";"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but..."
"Ross";"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back tothe museum."
"Susan";"What's it look like?"
"Ross";"Kinda like a big face without skin."
"Susan";"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it."
"Ross";"Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books aboutbein' a lesbian."
"Susan";"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let youdo it."
"Ross";"(picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic."
"Susan";"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby."
"Ross";"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're...crazy?"
"Susan";"What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?"
"Ross";"You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?"
"Susan";"Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice."
"Ross";"Do you uh, do you talk about me?"
"Susan";"Yeah, yeah, all the time."
"Ross";"Really?"
"Susan";"But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy."
"Ross";"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some bellytime too. Not that I believe any of this."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I canshow you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey,and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."
"Chandler";"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact,I'd very much like to butter your head."
"Monica";"Hey, Rach, did you make your money?"
"Rachel";"No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop,shoop, shoop."
"Monica";"Rach, here's your mail."
"Rachel";"Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
"Monica";"(insistently) No, here's your mail."
"Rachel";"Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
"Monica";"(gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?"
"Rachel";"Oh my god, oh, you guys are great."
"Monica";"We all chipped in."
"Joey";"(to Monica) We did?"
"Monica";"(to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks."
"Rachel";"Thank you. Thank you so much!"
"Monica";"(hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditionalThanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your familysize bag of Funyuns."
"Rachel";"Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgivingdinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"
"Chandler";"All right, I'm nine years old."
"Ross";"Oh, I hate this story."
"Chandler";"We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and Iremember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parentschoose to tell me they're getting divorced."
"Rachel";"Oh my god."
"Chandler";"Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner onceyou've seen it in reverse."
"Joey";"Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together."
"Joey";"Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.(pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis?"
"Joey";"I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business."
"Joey";"I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back."
"Joey";"Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?"
"Joey";"Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?"
"Joey";"What's wrong?"
"Joey";"Oh. What?"
"Joey";"Wait, wait, wait!"
"Joey";"So I guess you all saw it."
"Rachel";"Saw what?"
"Phoebe";"No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious."
"Joey";"Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD."
"Chandler";"Tonight, on a very special Blossom."
"Monica";"Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams areyamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?"
"Ross";"I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen."
"Monica";"All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stopmoping."
"Ross";"That's closer."
"Rachel";"I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop,shoop."
"Chandler";"Oh, you must stop shooping."
"Rachel";"Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff."
"Joey";"Chandler, will you just come in already?"
"Chandler";"No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment."
"Phoebe";"Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!"
"Chandler";"Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's notfunny anymore."
"Joey";"Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots."
"Monica";"That's not a question."
"Joey";"But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a littlepiece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can'tbe with my family because of my disease."
"Monica";"All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, andin the form of tots."
"Ross";"Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child."
"Monica";"Ah!"
"Ross";"Ok, Mom never hit."
"Phoebe";"(stirring pot) Ok, all done."
"Monica";"What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and thenadd some peas and onions."
"Monica";"Why would we do that?"
"Phoebe";"Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know,before she died."
"Monica";"Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up."
"Rachel";"Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, andhits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!"
"Chandler";"The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gottenaway."
"Joey";"The balloon?"
"Chandler";"No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's allover the news. Right before he reached"
"Rachel";"I can't, I gotta go."
"Chandler";"Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How oftendoes that happen?"
"Phoebe";"Almost never."
"Monica";"Got the keys?"
"Rachel";"Ok."
"Carol";"Anytime you're ready."
"Ross";"Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am Italking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certainacoustical advantage, but..."
"Carol";"Just aim for the bump."
"Ross";"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, thisis too weird. I feel stupid."
"Carol";"So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susandoes it."
"Ross";"(quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello."
"Rachel";"I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over thepark."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean."
"Monica";"Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy onthe inside. Why are we standing here?"
"Rachel";"We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys."
"Monica";"No I don't."
"Rachel";"Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys.""
"Monica";"No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?""
"Rachel";"No, no, no, you said, "got the keys"."
"Chandler";"Do either of you"
"Monica";"(panicked) The oven is on."
"Rachel";"Oh, I gotta get my ticket!"
"Joey";"Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key."
"Monica";"Well then get it, get it!"
"Joey";"That tone will not make me go any faster."
"Monica";"(angry) Joey!"
"Joey";"That one will."
"Ross";"And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major.So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let'sface it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore."
"Carol";"Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want."
"Ross";"Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?"
"Susan";"Hi, how's it goin?"
"Ross";"Shh! (singing)"
"Carol";"I did."
"Ross";"Does it always, uh--?"
"Carol";"No, no that was the first."
"Susan";"Keep singing! Keep singing!"
"Ross";"(singing)"
"Susan";"I felt it!"
"Ross";"(singin)"
"Joey";"Nope, not that one."
"Monica";"Can you go any faster with that?"
"Joey";"Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math."
"Monica";"Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?"
"Chandler";"(sarcastic) For an emergency just like this."
"Rachel";"(grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn'tfor you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes agesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not."
"Monica";"I swear you said you had the keys."
"Rachel";"No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and Iobviously didn't have the keys."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys."
"Monica";"Why would I have the keys?"
"Rachel";"Aside from the fact that you said you had them?"
"Monica";"But I didn't."
"Rachel";"Well, you should have."
"Monica";"Why?"
"Rachel";"Because!"
"Monica";"Why?"
"Rachel";"Because!"
"Monica";"Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'mmaking Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind ofpotatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind ofpotatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peasand onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned,and, and I... I..."
"Chandler";"Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open.Here we go."
"Monica";"Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoesare ruined, potatoes are ruined."
"Ross";"Here we come, walkin' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's."
"Monica";"No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the panof badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one."
"Rachel";"Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuckhere with you guys."
"Joey";"Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice."
"Monica";"Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this deliciousThanksgiving dinner?"
"Joey";"You call that delicious?"
"Monica";"Stop it, stop it, stop it!"
"Chandler";"Now this feels like Thanksgiving."
"Phoebe";"Ooh."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's notalone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal."
"Joey";"I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!"
"Monica";"Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!"
"Phoebe";"It's nice that he has someone."
"Chandler";"Shall I carve?"
"Rachel";"By all means."
"Chandler";"Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?"
"Ross";"I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese."
"Monica";"(holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?"
"Joey";"Oh, I will."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, you guys have to make a wish."
"Monica";"Make a wish?"
"Phoebe";"Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'dyou wish for?"
"Joey";"The bigger half."
"Chandler";"I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know thisisn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has beenreally great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been withyour family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivingssucked."
"All";"That's so sweet."
"Ross";"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
"Rachel";"And a crappy New Year."
"Chandler";"Here, here!"
"Ross";"Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet."
"All";"Oooh!"
"Monica";"W-wait. What is that?"
"Ross";"'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?"
"Monica";"No, no, I don't."
"Rachel";"Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?"
"Ross";"My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab."
"Phoebe";"That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?"
"Chandler";"Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!"
"Monica";"Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?"
"Ross";"Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so..."
"Monica";"Why don't you just get a roommate?"
"Ross";"Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate iskinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'reallycool way to live'."
"Phoebe";"So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songsabout my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman."
"Chandler";"Might wanna open with the snowman."
"All";"Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy."
"Monica";"So, how'd it go?"
"Joey";"Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job."
"Ross";"How could you not get it? You were Santa last year."
"Joey";"I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not evenjolly, it's all political."
"Monica";"So what are you gonna be?"
"Joey";"Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face,y'know?"
"Rachel";"Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They allprotest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?"
"Chandler";"Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horriblepressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you canhave someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!"
"Rachel";"Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, soI'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, you wish!"
"Chandler";"It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner."
"All";"Yeah, okay. Alright."
"Chandler";"Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm."
"All";"Woooo! Yeah!"
"Rachel";"Phoebe, you're on."
"Phoebe";"Oh, oh, good."
"Rachel";"(Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by populardemand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!"
"Phoebe";"(Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lotto me this time of year. (Shakes bell as an introduction) (Sung:)"
"Phoebe";"(Sung)"
"Phoebe";"(Sung)"
"Max";"No. No, that's- that's okay."
"Phoebe";"Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, thenI assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!"
"Chandler";"(Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!"
"David";"Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-"
"Phoebe";"Could you speak up please?"
"David";"(Stands up and speaks more loudly) Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to myfriend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in mylife. And then he said that- you said you thought"
"Max";"Daryl Hannah."
"David";"Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his lifeand I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, Ithought she had kind of a"
"Max";"Hard quality."
"David";"-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventionalway, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when youstarted yelling. (Sits down)"
"Phoebe";"Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)"
"Joey";"Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!"
"Ross";"Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)"
"Rachel";"Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by mysixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I justshare too much?"
"Ross";"Just a smidge."
"Phoebe";"David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical."
"Monica";"I think it's romantic."
"Phoebe";"Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?"
"Rachel";"Yeah!"
"Phoebe";"Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, excepthe-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all thetime. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions..."
"Chandler";"Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonnaask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break thepact."
"Phoebe";"No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice."
"Monica";"What?!"
"Ross";"C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!"
"Chandler";"I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped."
"Monica";"Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!"
"Chandler";"I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!"
"Joey";"Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late."
"Chandler";"Too many jokes... must mock Joey!"
"Joey";"Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)"
"Chandler";"Aah, y'killing me!"
"Monica";"Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!"
"Ross";"Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?"
"Monica";"Do you always have to bring him here?"
"Ross";"I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight thismorning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean,and he- he threw some faeces..."
"Chandler";"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
"Ross";"Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you'rethere to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."
"Chandler";"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."
"David";"...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particleaccelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions."
"Phoebe";"Okay, alright, I have a question, then."
"David";"Yuh."
"Phoebe";"Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?"
"David";"Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be(Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kissthat happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you."
"Phoebe";"Sure."
"David";"Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had tobe, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where Ijust like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm notreally a, uh, sweeping sorta fella."
"Phoebe";"Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're asweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body."
"David";"Rrrreally."
"Phoebe";"Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep andthrow me."
"David";"...Now? Now?"
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah, right now."
"David";"Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptopcomputer) Y'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picksup a microscope) And I'll take- this was a gift. (Moves it)"
"Phoebe";"Okay, now you're just kinda tidying."
"David";"Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off thedesk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?"
"Phoebe";"I can hop. (She hops onto the table)"
"Ross";"So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?"
"Monica";"I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe hassomebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby."
"Chandler";"Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Joey";"You know more than one Fun Bobby?"
"Chandler";"I happen to know a Fun Bob."
"Rachel";"(Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go..."
"Joey";"Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!"
"Rachel";"(Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is."
"Ross";"Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates."
"Joey";"Uh, four."
"Ross";"Four."
"Rachel";"Five."
"Ross";"Five. (Buries his head in his hands)"
"Rachel";"Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight."
"Joey";"Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf todo?"
"Ross";"Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the balldrops?"
"Rachel";"Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who'swith who."
"Ross";"Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now."
"Monica";"What's the matter?"
"Ross";"Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walkingaround all the time dragging his hands..."
"Chandler";"That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night."
"Ross";"Really."
"Chandler";"Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing."
"Ross";"What, uh... what juggling thing?"
"Chandler";"With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that."
"Ross";"No."
"Chandler";"Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and amelon..."
"Max";"Phoebe. Hi."
"Phoebe";"Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?"
"Max";"No. Have you seen David?"
"Phoebe";"No, no, he hasn't been around."
"Max";"Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk."
"Phoebe";"Minsk?"
"Max";"Minsk. It's in Russia."
"Phoebe";"I know where Minsk is."
"Max";"We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid."
"Phoebe";"So when, when do you leave?"
"Max";"January first."
"Phoebe";"Hello?"
"David";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hi."
"David";"Hi! (Kisses her) What-what're you doing here?"
"Phoebe";"Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice)congratulations! This is so exciting!"
"Max";"It'd be even more exciting if we were going."
"Phoebe";"Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?"
"Max";"Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson andYamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with mygirlfriend!!' (Storms out)"
"David";"Thank you, Max. Thank you."
"Phoebe";"So-so you're really not going?"
"David";"I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide."
"Phoebe";"Oh don't do that."
"David";"Please."
"Phoebe";"Oh no no."
"David";"No, but I'm asking-"
"Phoebe";"Oh, but I can't do that-"
"David";"No, but I can't-"
"Phoebe";"It's your thing, and-"
"David";"-make the decision-"
"Phoebe";"Okay, um, stay."
"David";"Stay."
"Phoebe";"Stay."
"Phoebe";"Getting so good at that! (She hops on)"
"David";"It was Max's stuff. (They kiss)"
"Janice";"I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the dietstarts tomorrow! (Laughs her Janice laugh)"
"Chandler";"You remember Janice."
"Monica";"Vividly."
"Monica";"Hi."
"Sandy";"Hi, I'm Sandy."
"Joey";"Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a youngergirl)...You brought your kids."
"Sandy";"Yeah. That's okay, right?"
"Ross";"Par-tay!"
"Monica";"That thing is not coming in here."
"Ross";"'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask yousomething, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in yourhome?"
"Monica";"I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table."
"Ross";"Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him tohave the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened..."
"Monica";"Alright. Just keep him away from me."
"Ross";"Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do alittle mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later."
"Monica";"Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?"
"Rachel";"Rome. Jerk missed his flight."
"Phoebe";"And then... your face is bloated?"
"Rachel";"No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman-this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was hercab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by myhair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'mgoing to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on mywhistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?"
"Sandy";"Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the firsttime I ever mentally undressed an elf."
"Joey";"Wow, that's, uh, dirty."
"Sandy";"Yeah."
"Joey";"Hey, kids..."
"Ross";"(Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm notsaying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in."
"Janice";"(Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!"
"Chandler";"(Imitating) But you found me!"
"Janice";"Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he startssnapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera!"
"Chandler";"Kill me. Kill me now."
"Monica";"Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!"
"Fun Bobby";"Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about twohours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!"
"Joey";"(Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?"
"Fun Bobby";"It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to seehim again."
"Janice";"(Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, andI'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter."
"Chandler";"Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when Iinvited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-"
"Janice";"Oh, no. Oh, no."
"Chandler";"I'm sorry you misunderstood..."
"Janice";"Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of thesetimes is just gonna be your last chance with me. (She runs off)"
"Chandler";"Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)"
"Phoebe";"Hi, Max!"
"Max";"Yoko. (To David) I've decided to go to Minsk without you."
"David";"Wow."
"Max";"It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.(Walks off)"
"Phoebe";"Are you alright?"
"David";"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine."
"Phoebe";"You're going to Minsk."
"David";"No, I'm... not going to Minsk."
"Phoebe";"Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay herejust 'cause of me."
"David";"Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and Ican't break up with you."
"Phoebe";"Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life andthat's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you saythat?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't youunderstand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'."
"David";"Uh, ow."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then youput your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me andyou'll never forget me."
"David";"I'll never forget you."
"Phoebe";"And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go becauseyou don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonnamiss you. You scientist guy."
"Dick Clark";"(on TV) Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in avirtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square..."
"Joey";"There y'go, kids."
"Chandler";"(To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me.(Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)"
"Joey";"You seen Sandy?"
"Chandler";"Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica'sbedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how totell you."
"Rachel";"Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing."
"Rachel";"The bll is drrbing!"
"Dick Clark";"(on TV) In twenty seconds it'll be midnight..."
"Chandler";"And the moment of joy is upon us."
"Joey";"Looks like that no date pact thing worked out."
"Phoebe";"Everybody looks so happy. I hate that."
"Monica";"Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!"
"Chandler";"Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz,but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)"
"Phoebe";"I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight."
"Rachel";"I can't kiss anyone."
"Monica";"So I'm kissing everyone?"
"Joey";"Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother."
"Ross";"Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me."
"Chandler";"Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebodykiss me!"
"Joey";"Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There."
"Ross";"(Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. Imean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoningit in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love youback."
"Phoebe";"Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?"
"Monica";"Why?"
"Phoebe";"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right."
"Monica";"Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, butbehind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit ofdepression."
"Phoebe";"Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma."
"Monica";"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
"Phoebe";"We should do something. Whistle."
"Monica";"We are not going to whistle."
"Phoebe";"Come on, do it."
"Monica";"No!"
"Phoebe";"Do it!"
"Monica";"No!"
"Phoebe";"Do it do it do it!"
"Monica";"(Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!"
"Phoebe";"I can't believe you did that!"
"Monica";"Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-thathe'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?"
"Phoebe";"I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks tohim) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!"
"Monica";"Phoebe, what are you doing?"
"Phoebe";"Maybe nobody's tried this."
"Monica";"I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, evensleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he'sartistic."
"Monica";"Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he candance!"
"Phoebe";"Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening,y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked."
"Monica";"I wish all guys could be like him."
"Phoebe";"I know."
"Chandler";"Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?"
"Monica";"He doesn't have anyone."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible."
"Joey";"I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo."
"Rachel";"Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)"
"Jay Leno";"(on TV) Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book,'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kidsto bed for this one."
"Chandler";"Y'know, we don't have to watch this."
"Rachel";"No way, forget it."
"Joey";"C'mon, she's your mom!"
"Chandler";"Exactly."
"Rachel";"Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! Icannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years oldand all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"
"Ross";"C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast."
"Chandler";"You can say that because she's not your mom."
"Ross";"Oh, please..."
"Paolo";"Bona sera."
"Rachel";"Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)"
"Ross";"When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?"
"Monica";"Last night."
"Ross";"Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just adream I had- but, phew."
"Phoebe";"Hey hey hey! She's on!"
"Paolo";"Ah! Nora Bing!"
"Jay Leno";"(on TV) ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London?What is that all about?"
"Phoebe";"Your mom was arrested?"
"Chandler";"Shhh, busy beaming with pride."
"Mrs. Bing";"(on TV) ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I'vebeen intimate with a man..."
"Chandler";"Now why would she say that's embarrassing?"
"All";"Shhh."
"Mrs. Bing";"(on TV) ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken."
"Chandler";"THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!"
"Jay Leno";"(on TV) Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, howis that going?"
"Mrs. Bing";"(on TV) Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate-but I get to see my son, who I love..."
"All";"Awww!"
"Chandler";"This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone."
"Jay Leno";"(on TV) Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as amom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad..."
"Mrs. Bing";"(on TV) Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his firstcondoms."
"Chandler";"...And then he burst into flames."
"Monica";"Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... themayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teamsplayed sports."
"Phoebe";"What about Glen? He could be a Glen."
"Monica";"Nah... not-not special enough."
"Phoebe";"Ooh! How about Agamemnon?"
"Monica";"Waaay too special."
"Mrs. Bing";"I am famished. What do I want... (Looks at Chandler's menu)"
"Chandler";"Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken."
"Mrs. Bing";"Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?"
"Chandler";"Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little."
"Ross";"(Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place."
"Mrs. Bing";"Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. (They both sit down)Well, I think we're ready for some tequila."
"Chandler";"I know I am."
"Mrs. Bing";"Who's doing shots?"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"I'm in."
"Mrs. Bing";"There y'go. Ross?"
"Ross";"Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy."
"Rachel";"Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track oftime."
"Ross";"...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)"
"Ross";"Anyone want me to appraise anything?"
"Rachel";"Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written.No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become awriter."
"Mrs. Bing";"Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You juststart with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia,and bam! You have got yourself a book."
"Chandler";"Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen."
"Mrs. Bing";"Yeah, any messages for room 226?"
"Mrs. Bing";"You okay there, slugger?"
"Ross";"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him andhe tries to pretend he was in the other one)"
"Mrs. Bing";"What is with you tonight?"
"Ross";"Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing."
"Mrs. Bing";"(To phone) Okay, thank you. (To Ross) It's the Italian Hand-Licker,isn't it."
"Ross";"No. It's the one he's licking."
"Mrs. Bing";"She's supposed to be with you."
"Ross";"You're good."
"Mrs. Bing";"Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of mybooks, and y'know why?"
"Ross";"The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?"
"Mrs. Bing";"No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with.Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pagesfor a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication youeventually kill off."
"Ross";"When?"
"Mrs. Bing";"He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is."
"Ross";"The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?"
"Mrs. Bing";"No, it's you!"
"Ross";"Please."
"Mrs. Bing";"No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy..."
"Ross";"Right."
"Mrs. Bing";"You are gonna be fine, believe me."
"Ross";"Uh-oh..."
"Joey";"Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street."
"Ross";"Hey, is Chandler here?"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakeshis head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just akiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?"
"Joey";"Right. No big deal."
"Ross";"Okay."
"Joey";"In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!"
"Ross";"What code?"
"Joey";"You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin'aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!"
"Chandler";"What are you guys doing out here?"
"Ross";"Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morningracquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept."
"Joey";"Yeah, well, you don't have your racket."
"Ross";"No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed tobring me one."
"Joey";"Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size."
"Chandler";"Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back insideand shuts the door)"
"Ross";"Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum."
"Joey";"Ross, how could you let this happen?"
"Ross";"I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know?She's, she's sexy, she's..."
"Joey";"You don't think my mom's sexy?"
"Ross";"Well... not in the same way..."
"Joey";"I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day,alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?"
"Ross";"Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here..."
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Ross";"Hey."
"Rachel";"What're you guys doing out here?"
"Ross";"Well, not playing raquetball!"
"Joey";"He forgot to leave his grip size!"
"Ross";"He didn't get the goggles!"
"Rachel";"Well,sounds like you two have issues."
"Rachel";"Goodbye, baby."
"Paolo";"Ciao, bela."
"Ross";"Do they wait for me to do this?"
"Joey";"So are you gonna tell him?"
"Ross";"Why would I tell him?"
"Joey";"How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might."
"Ross";"Oh..."
"Monica";"(Entering) What are you guys doing here?"
"Joey";"Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!"
"Monica";"...What did I ask?"
"Monica";"Hi."
"Phoebe";"Hi."
"Monica";"What are you doing here?"
"Phoebe";"Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I..y'know, so what are you doing here?"
"Monica";"I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. myway... Do you come here a lot? Without me?"
"Phoebe";"No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No!...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?"
"Monica";"How would I know? I-I wasn't here."
"Phoebe";"Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet toreveal him wearing new pajamas.)"
"Chandler";"Oh my God."
"Ross";"You're my friend. I-I had to tell you."
"Chandler";"I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?"
"Ross";"Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and youknow how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) Ican't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom."
"Chandler";"What?"
"Ross";"I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too muchtequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothinghappened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-"
"Chandler";"(To Joey) You knew about this?"
"Joey";"Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing."
"Chandler";"I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!"
"Joey";"Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knowswhat woulda happened."
"Ross";"Thanks, man, big help."
"Chandler";"(To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?"
"Ross";"I wasn't- I mean, I-"
"Chandler";"Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with mymom more than you."
"Ross";"I know-"
"Chandler";"I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)"
"Ross";"Chandler-"
"Joey";"Me neither, y'know what-"
"Chandler";"I'm still mad at you for not telling me."
"Joey";"What are you mad at me for?!"
"Ross";"Chandler-"
"Chandler";"You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)"
"Joey";"(Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) Seewhat happens when you break the code?"
"Ross";"Joey-"
"Joey";"Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)"
"Monica";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Monica";"(Reading) 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'."
"Rachel";"Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now,do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?"
"Monica";"(Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'."
"Phoebe";"(Walks up with her guitar) Hey Rach."
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Phoebe";"Hello."
"Monica";"Hello."
"Phoebe";"Going to the hospital tonight?"
"Monica";"No, you?"
"Phoebe";"No, you?"
"Monica";"You just asked me."
"Phoebe";"Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, Rachel canwe do this now?"
"Rachel";"Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!"
"Joey";"(To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and father ontheir wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout."
"Ross";"I cannot believe we're having this conversation."
"Joey";"C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all."
"Rachel";"(Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay."
"Phoebe";"Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a manthat I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. (Monica gives her a look)'Kay. (Sung:)"
"Rachel";"(Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!"
"Chandler";"What was that?"
"Ross";"Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a..."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?(Goes to the counter)"
"Joey";"(Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up."
"Ross";"Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, Ijust wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips."
"Chandler";"Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudiannightmare."
"Ross";"Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?"
"Chandler";"Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!"
"Ross";"(To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play."
"Chandler";"That's very funny. We done now?"
"Ross";"No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tellher how you feel?"
"Chandler";"That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with mymom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her."
"Ross";"Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs hisfinger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee)That's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!"
"Phoebe";"Alright, whadyou do with him?"
"Monica";"Oh! You're awake!"
"Phoebe";"Look at you! How, how do you feel?"
"Coma Guy";"Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay."
"Monica";"You look good!"
"Coma Guy";"I feel good! ...Who are you?"
"Monica";"Oh, sorry."
"Phoebe";"I'm Phoebe Buffay."
"Monica";"I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you."
"Phoebe";"Well, we both have."
"Coma Guy";"So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?"
"Phoebe";"Well, actually it's just from me."
"Monica";"I got you the foot massager."
"Phoebe";"You know who shaved you? That was me."
"Monica";"I read to you."
"Phoebe";"I sang. (To Monica) Hah!"
"Coma Guy";"Well,... thanks."
"Monica";"Oh, my pleasure."
"Phoebe";"You're welcome."
"Coma Guy";"So. I guess I'll see you around."
"Phoebe";"What, that's it?"
"Monica";""See you around?""
"Coma Guy";"Well, what do you want me to say?"
"Monica";"Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit somethingto me? "I'll call you?""
"Coma Guy";"Alright, I'll call you."
"Phoebe";"I don't think you mean that."
"Monica";"This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then-we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "Seeyou around!" Let's go, Phoebe."
"Phoebe";"Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just thecoma."
"Mrs. Bing";"Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies ofmy book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?"
"Chandler";"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough."
"Mrs. Bing";"Alright, well, be good, I love you. (Kisses him and goes to leave)"
"Chandler";"You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect."
"Mrs. Bing";"(Reentering) O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid."
"Chandler";"Really stupid."
"Mrs. Bing";"Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry,honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?"
"Chandler";"Yeah. No. No..."
"Ross";"Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door."
"Joey";"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, abouteverything."
"Ross";"You're kidding."
"Joey";"No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being amom?""
"Ross";"Wow!"
"Joey";"Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow upand realise I have a bomb?""
"Ross";"'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonnagrow up and realise I am your mom?""
"Joey";"That makes more sense."
"Ross";"So, what's going on now?"
"Joey";"I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back tothe door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)"
"Ross";"Whaddya see?"
"Joey";"Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walkingaway... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!"
"Mrs. Bing";"You okay, kiddo?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, okay."
"Mrs. Bing";"Alright. (Kisses him)"
"Chandler";"Nice save."
"Ross";"(Very politely) Mrs. Bing."
"Mrs. Bing";"Mr. Geller."
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Ross";"You mean that?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her."
"Ross";"Yeah? How'd it go?"
"Chandler";"Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse."
"Ross";"Well, howdya feel?"
"Chandler";"Pretty good! I told her."
"Ross";"Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing yourmom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to godown that road."
"Rachel";"Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolutehonest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'."
"Monica";"What's a 'niffle'?"
"Joey";"You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'."
"Rachel";"Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist..."
"Ross";"Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya,you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!"
"Rachel";"Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!"
"Chandler";"No-no-no-no, we're done."
"Joey";"Ross, did you really read all these baby books?"
"Ross";"Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, nocompass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)"
"Phoebe";"Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actuallyeat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)"
"Chandler";"And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)"
"Phoebe";"(softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)"
"Monica";"Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want meto do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, AuntSyl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?"
"Joey";"Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?(measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-likevoice) Hi Daddy!"
"Ross";"(waves) Hello!"
"Rachel";"Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touchingPaolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)"
"Monica";"So, did I hear Poconos?"
"Rachel";"Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend."
"Phoebe";"Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!"
"Monica";"Yeah, that's a big step."
"Rachel";"I know..."
"Chandler";"(to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!"
"Ross";"Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makesflinging motions with hands) flung by now?"
"Rachel";"I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling thingsthat I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him,I'm totally, totally..."
"Ross";"...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Callimmigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!"
"Joey";"I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes,and their little baby hands..."
"Chandler";"Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!"
"Joey";"Need a new table."
"Chandler";"You think?"
"Carol";"Hey hey, come on in!"
"Ross";"Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sendsher love, along with this lasagna."
"Carol";"Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat."
"Carol";"So, I got the results of the amnio today."
"Carol";"Totally and completely healthy!"
"Ross";"Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up apicture frame)"
"Ross";"Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?"
"Carol";"Uh, that's our friend Tanya."
"Carol";"Don't you want to know about the sex?"
"Carol";"The sex of the baby, Ross."
"Ross";"Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!"
"Carol";"Do you want to know?"
"Ross";"No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, youknow, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!(pauses) Or isn't..."
"Susan";"Oh, hello Ross!"
"Ross";"Susan..."
"Susan";"So, so, did you hear?"
"Ross";"Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!"
"Susan";"Oh, that's so... (Susan hugs Carol, they giggle, Ross steps away) Itreally is...do we know...?"
"Carol";"Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be..."
"Susan";"Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?"
"Carol";"Mm-hmmm (Susan and Carol hug, giggling. Ross stands back, reaches out andlightly taps Susan's shoulder)"
"Ross";"Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?"
"";":"
"Carol";"Well, thanks for the books."
"Ross";"No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's stomach,then punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)"
"Susan";"All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?(intercom buzzer rings)"
"Carol";"Hello?"
"Chandler";"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"
"Joey";"That's the rule."
"Chandler";"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
"Joey";"How'd you get to that?"
"Chandler";"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your littlebreakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
"Joey";"You knew about that?"
"Chandler";"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter leftlittle to the imagination."
"Joey";"Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
"Chandler";"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
"Joey";"Yeah"
"Chandler";"You think we're ready for something like that?"
"Joey";"Why not?"
"Chandler";"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants tomove out?"
"Joey";"Why, are you moving out?"
"Chandler";"I'm not moving out."
"Joey";"You'd tell me if you were moving out right"
"Chandler";"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
"Joey";"Aw, I know all about Kip!"
"Chandler";"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off andgot married, and things got pretty ugly."
"Joey";"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?"
"Chandler";"Aw, don't do that"
"Phoebe";"Ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?"
"Phoebe";"Well, Racquela's right, yeah!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started."
"Phoebe";"Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know,to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!"
"Monica";"And Monica knows..."
"Ross";"Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!"
"Monica";"Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me."
"Joey";"So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up andwaves arms frantically in protest)"
"Ross";"Wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!"
"Monica";"I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!"
"Joey";"Or an uncle..."
"Ross";"Hi Pheebs!"
"Rachel";"Pheebs!"
"Phoebe";"Fine!"
"Monica";"Phoebe, what's the matter?"
"Phoebe";"Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts."
"Rachel";"Oh, right, that's me!"
"Joey";"Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on."
"Chandler";"Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)"
"Monica";"Phoebe, what is it?"
"Phoebe";"All right, you know Paolo?"
"Ross";"I'm familiar with his work, yes..."
"Phoebe";"Well, he made a move on me."
"Joey";"Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!"
"Chandler";"More coffee over here, please!"
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah, I'm sure. (Flashback resumes with Phoebe doing a voiceover.)And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (Flashback continues: Paolorolls over, Phoebe looks down, then quickly looks up, bites lip, shakes her head)"
"Monica";"Was it...?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there."
"Rachel";""Ooo," what?"
"Phoebe";"Uma Thurman."
"Monica";"Oh!"
"Ross";"The actress!"
"Ross";"Thanks Rach."
"Chandler";"So what are you gonna do?"
"Ross";"You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, asa friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys tochime in)"
"Chandler";"Oh, yeah, you have to tell her."
"Joey";"Feminist issue. That's where I went!"
"Phoebe";"She is gonna hate me."
"Joey";"Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to atable)"
"Chandler";"That's patio furniture!"
"Joey";"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outsideagain?" Of course!"
"Joey";"I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eatsomething.""
"Chandler";"You pick one."
"Joey";"All right, how about the ladybugs?"
"Chandler";"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest finedining!"
"Joey";"Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!"
"Chandler";"Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joeyturns and gives Chandler a dirty look)"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hi Pheebs!"
"Phoebe";"Are you moving out?"
"Rachel";"No, these aren't all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase andshows to Phoebe) This one's Paolo's."
"Phoebe";"Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?"
"Rachel";"Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over."
"Phoebe";"Oh! (sits down) Ok, um, ok, um,"
"Rachel";"Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs..."
"Phoebe";"Ok, um, (clears throat) we haven't known each other for that long atime, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends arethe most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmealraisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the othercookies"
"Rachel";"All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I'veever had."
"Phoebe";"Which proves that I never lie."
"Rachel";"I guess you don't."
"Phoebe";"Paolo made a pass at me."
"Chandler";"So, what do you think?"
"Ross";"I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen."
"Chandler";"I know!"
"Monica";"So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these littleguys' heads?"
"Joey";"Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!"
"Monica";"Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points atChandler) You suck!"
"Phoebe";"Are you okay?"
"Rachel";"I need some milk."
"Phoebe";"Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup)Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better?"
"Rachel";"No..."
"Phoebe";"I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!"
"Rachel";"Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!"
"Phoebe";"Phoebe:"
"Phoebe";"No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?"
"Rachel";"I don't know...right, he's the pig!"
"Phoebe";"Such a pig!"
"Rachel";"Oh, God, he's such a pig,"
"Phoebe";"Oh he's like a..."
"Rachel";"He's like a big disgusting..."
"Phoebe";"...like a..."
"Rachel";"...pig...pig man!"
"Phoebe";"Yes, good! Ok..."
"Rachel";"(voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?"
"Phoebe";"(raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It's because... he'sgorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you..."
"Rachel";"Ok, Ok, Pheebs..."
"Phoebe";"The end."
"Rachel";"Oh, God..."
"Phoebe";"Should I not have told you?"
"Rachel";"No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I justliked it better before it was better..."
"Phoebe";"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now,so..."
"Joey";"No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-thereteam."
"Ross";"Come on, two on one."
"Chandler";"What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it'stime for you to swoop in!"
"Ross";"What, now?"
"Joey";"Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks outof there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he'snot! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!"
"Chandler";"My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her.You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look offinto the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)"
"Ross";"(entering) How's it going?"
"Monica";"Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony,now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands infront of her chest), Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormousbreasts!" Here he comes!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, ok bye-bye."
"Monica";"Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him alasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles."
"Ross";"Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when Isay... (shuts door in his face and walks away)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the balcony)"
"Ross";"Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she'snot overwhelmed..."
"Monica";"Oh, you're right."
"Ross";"(pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me."
"Ross";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Ross";"You all right?"
"Rachel";"Ooh, I've been better..."
"Ross";"Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better thanhim...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when hehas you."
"Rachel";"Oh, Ross..."
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't wantto think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)"
"Ross";"Huh."
"Rachel";"Oh Ross, you're so great!"
"Ross";"Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)"
"Monica";"Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?"
"Rachel";"Oh..."
"Phoebe";"You ok?"
"Rachel";"...medium...hmm...any cookies left?"
"Phoebe";"Yep!"
"Ross";"See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is theanswer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticatedscreening process."
"Rachel";"No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got tofigure out what I want"
"Ross";"Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo."
"Rachel";"No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow upto be one."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Ross";"I-I'm, I'm having a boy?"
"Rachel";"Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy."
"Ross";"Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?"
"Girls";"Yes, you're having a boy! (Monica runs over and hugs Ross)"
"Ross";"I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!"
"Chandler";"Wha-"
"Joey";"Wha-"
"Joey and Chandler";"What is it?"
"Ross";"I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Ross";"I'm having a son. Um..."
"Monica";"Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!"
"Joey";"Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, get out!"
"Monica";"You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only usemy left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, Igotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone."
"Chandler";"(to Joey) One more game?"
"Rachel";"That is"
"Chandler";"I'm sorry!"
"Rachel";"You have no respect for anybody's privacy!"
"Chandler";"Rachel, wait, wait."
"Rachel";"No, you wait! This is ridiculous!"
"Chandler";"Can I just say one thing?"
"Rachel";"What? What?!"
"Chandler";"That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipularareas."
"Rachel";"Oh!!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinksthings are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower."
"Roger";"That's pretty much it."
"Phoebe";"Oops!"
"Roger";"But you tell it really well, sweetie."
"Phoebe";"Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you."
"Roger";"Okay. I'll miss you."
"Phoebe";"Isn't he great?"
"Rachel";"He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much."
"Phoebe";"I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he'snot too shrinky, y'know?"
"Monica";"So, you think you'll do it on his couch?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know?Vinyl."
"Rachel";"Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else?"
"Chandler";"Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)"
"Rachel";"No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?"
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Roger";"Did I, uh, did I miss something?"
"Chandler";"No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies."
"Ross";"You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?"
"Chandler";"It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescopeand a box of donuts."
"Rachel";"Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts."
"Rachel";"Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change."
"Chandler";"Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very niceboobies."
"Rachel";"Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice."
"Chandler";"Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me."
"Roger";"You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when whenthe laughter stops."
"Chandler";"Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?"
"Roger";"Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know,that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance."
"Chandler";"Huh."
"Roger";"I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child,right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty."
"Chandler";"Uhhuh, how did you know that?"
"Roger";"It's textbook."
"Joey";"Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?"
"All";"Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!"
"Monica";"Hey, how long are you in the city?"
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm betteroff staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. (Sees Roger) Idon't know this one."
"Phoebe";"Oh, this is my friend Roger."
"Roger";"Hi."
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger."
"Roger";"You too, sir."
"Mr. Tribbiani";"(To Phoebe) What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?"
"Joey";"Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)"
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? (Ross whines and layshis head on Chandler's shoulder) Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say somethingfunny!"
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real latenow"
"Joey";"(Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr.Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?"
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician."
"Joey";"Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)"
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to thenavy yard and show you the big ships?"
"Joey";"Since then?!"
"Mr. Tribbiani";"No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memoryin your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever beenin love?"
"Joey";"...I d'know."
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes."
"Joey";"You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)"
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is,it's with two different women."
"Joey";"Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma."
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you."
"Joey";"It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading thisdouble life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd becool.... This blows!"
"Rachel";"I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks overnear Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to becomepeople? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?"
"Chandler";"(Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?"
"Rachel";"Did you not get a good enough look the other day?"
"Ross";"Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolvethis. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee."
"Chandler";"Y'know, I don't see that happening?"
"Rachel";"C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat."
"Chandler";"Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'"
"Monica";"Hello?"
"Phoebe";"(Intercom) It's Phoebe."
"Roger";"(Intercom) And Rog."
"Monica";"C'mon up."
"Chandler";"(Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here."
"Joey";"What's the matter with Rog?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy."
"Ross";"What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon,he's not that bad."
"Ross";"Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought onany level thatthat she was a lesbian?"
"Roger";"I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail."
"Ross";"Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?"
"Roger";"I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate forovershadowing a sibling, maybe you..."
"Monica";"Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing."
"Roger";"Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotageyour marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents."
"Ross";"That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!"
"Monica";"Oh! So you think I'm a failure!"
"Phoebe";"Isn't he good?"
"Ross";"Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying..."
"Monica";"Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe whatyou were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!"
"Ross";"Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!"
"Rachel";"You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but itwas the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this littlelifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in."
"Roger";"That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie,we gotta get going."
"Phoebe";"Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?"
"Roger";"Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie..."
"Phoebe";"Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon."
"Monica";"You're welcome."
"Roger";"Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on thosecookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love."
"Monica";"Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)"
"Joey";"Night, you guys."
"Chandler";"Oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
"Joey";"Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?"
"Ronni";"Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani."
"Joey";"I'm Joey Tribbiani."
"Ronni";"Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than yourpictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?"
"Chandler";"Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?"
"Ronni";"Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sortalaid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in apose. Like, chasing their tail, (Demonstrates) or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee."
"Chandler";"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys."
"Ronni";"That's a good one!"
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Hey, Joe."
"Joey";"Dad, Ronni's here."
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Huh?"
"Ronni";"Hi."
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?"
"Ronni";"Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'dneed it tomorrow for your meeting. (Hands him the hair)"
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Thank you. Uh..."
"Chandler";"So, who's up for a big game of"
"Ronni";"Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna missthe last train."
"Mr. Tribbiani";"I don't want you taking that thing."
"Ronni";"Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?"
"Joey";"Who-ah-ho."
"Mr. Tribbiani";"We'll go to a hotel."
"Ronni";"(Shrugs) We'll go to a hotel."
"Joey";"No you won't."
"Ronni";"No we won't."
"Joey";"If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here whereI can keep an eye on you."
"Mr. Tribbiani";"You're gonna keep an eye on us?"
"Joey";"That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you'reunder my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with yourgirlfriend."
"Ronni";"Wow. He's strict."
"Joey";"Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room."
"Ronni";"Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid."
"Chandler";"C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's notfollowed by "No thanks, it's late.""
"Joey";"Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make achange. This has gone on long enough."
"Mr. Tribbiani";"What kinda change?"
"Joey";"Well, either you break it off with Ronni"
"Mr. Tribbiani";"I can't do that!"
"Joey";"Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!"
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Yeah, but this is"
"Joey";"I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!"
"Chandler";"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
"Joey";"Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear."
"Chandler";"Well, you're gonna."
"Joey";"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top ofgirls..."
"Chandler";"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
"Joey";"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy andgo the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
"Chandler";"Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to gointo your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
"Joey";"No."
"Chandler";"No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now thatwasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comesalong, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married.""
"Joey";"You really think so?"
"Chandler";"Yeah. I really do."
"Joey";"Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)"
"Chandler";"Get off!"
"Ronni";"Hi."
"Monica";"Hi...May I help you?"
"Ronni";"Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's inours?"
"Monica";"Okay...who are you?"
"Ronni";"Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?"
"Monica";"Oh, c'mon in."
"Ronni";"Thanks."
"Rachel";"Hi, I'm Rachel."
"Ronni";"Hi."
"Rachel";"Bathroom's up there."
"Ronni";"Great."
"Rachel";"Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in theshower?"
"Ronni";"Oh, like, uh, five minutes?"
"Rachel";"Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. (She goes into Joeyand Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib."
"Mr. Tribbiani";"Hey. Morning, dear."
"Rachel";"Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing."
"Joey";"(Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!"
"Rachel";"I thought it was Chandler!"
"Chandler";"(Comes out of his room) What? What?"
"Rachel";"You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!"
"Chandler";"Sorry, my my thing was in there with me."
"All";"Hey, Pheebs."
"Phoebe";"Hey."
"Monica";"How's it going?"
"Phoebe";"Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to inviteyou guys."
"Phoebe";"So what's going on?"
"Monica";"Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger."
"Ross";"I dunno, there's just something about..."
"Chandler";"Basically we just feel that he's..."
"Rachel";"We hate that guy."
"All";"Yeah. Hate him."
"Ross";"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry."
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he'sso perceptive that it freaks you out?"
"All";"...No, we hate him."
"Rachel";"We're sorry."
"Joey";"Ma! What're you doing here?"
"Mrs. Tribbiani";"I came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) and this.(Whacks him round the ear)"
"Joey";"Oww! Big ring!"
"Mrs. Tribbiani";"Why did you have to fill your father's head with all thatgarbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken inthere, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. (She gives the sofabed a tiny push andit folds away)"
"Joey";"Hold on, you-you knew?"
"Mrs. Tribbiani";"Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no JamesBond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at myaccountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!"
"Joey";"So then how could you I mean, how could you?!"
"Mrs. Tribbiani";"Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling,always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, notthose stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, hehas a hobby."
"Joey";"Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talkingabout?! I mean, what about you?"
"Mrs. Tribbiani";"Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her,and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since thatpoodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive,he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary."
"Joey";"I'm...happy...for you?"
"Mrs. Tribbiani";"Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just wantit the way it was."
"Joey";"Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want."
"Mrs. Tribbiani";"I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did yousee her?"
"Joey";"Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is."
"Mrs. Tribbiani";"That's sweet. Could I take her?"
"Joey";"With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest."
"Roger";"What's wrong, sweetie?"
"Phoebe";"Nothing, nothing."
"Roger";"Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. (Pats his leg. She lies down and rests herhead in his lap)"
"Phoebe";"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have aliking problem with you. In that, um, they don't."
"Roger";"Oh. They don't."
"Phoebe";"But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see allthe good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little..."
"Roger";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Intense and creepy."
"Roger";"Oh."
"Phoebe";"But I don't. Me, Phoebe."
"Roger";"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way."
"Phoebe";"You're not? See, that's why you're so great!"
"Roger";"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have thiskind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionallystunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry,might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Loveme, I need love!'."
"Monica";"So you talked to your dad, huh."
"Joey";"Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keeppretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see herhusband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do withanything except that I found out today."
"Rachel";"Wow."
"Chandler";"Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain."
"Ross";"So Joey, you okay?"
"Joey";"Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go.Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes."
"Rachel";"Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them."
"Chandler";"If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasingafter twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey."
"All";"Hey, Pheebs."
"Monica";"How's it going?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger."
"All";"Awww."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, right."
"All";"Aaawwwwww!!"
"Rachel";"What happened?"
"Phoebe";"I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet,and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!"
"Phoebe";"Hey, Joey. What's going on?"
"Joey";"Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.(He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monicain a towel)"
"Monica";"Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!"
"Joey";"Sorry. Wrong boobies."
"Monica";"Hello, Joey."
"Joey";"I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you."
"Ross";"She barely knows me. We just live in the same building."
"Chandler";"Any contact?"
"Ross";"She lent me an egg once."
"Joey";"You're in!"
"Ross";"Aw, right."
"Ross";"Hey. (stutters something incoherent)"
"Chandler";"Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachelthing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don't think we need a third..."
"Joey";"Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks."
"Ross";"An egg?"
"Joey";"Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'mreturning your egg.""
"Chandler";"I think it's winning."
"Ross";"I think it's insane."
"Chandler";"She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend."
"Joey";"Think it'll work?"
"Chandler";"No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg."
"Monica";"You can not do this."
"Rachel";"Do what, do what?"
"Monica";"Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night."
"Rachel";"No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?"
"Phoebe";"'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright,still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
"Monica";"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. Iknow I do."
"Rachel";"Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
"Joey";"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
"Chandler";"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
"Joey";"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' outwith me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend."
"Chandler";"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
"Joey";"Pathetic mess? I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she'svulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up andeats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin'this."
"Ross";"Hi. She said yes."
"Chandler";"Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches inRoss' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?"
"Joey";"(Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?"
"Chandler";"Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember,no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
"Lorraine";"Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice."
"Chandler";"...And what did you bring?"
"Lorraine";"She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off myhands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice."
"Chandler";"Janice?"
"Janice";"Oh.... my.... God."
"Chandler";"(angrily) Hey, it's Janice."
"Chandler";"Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window."
"Joey";"No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out withLorraine. Just calm down."
"Chandler";"Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumpedtwice in the last five months!"
"Joey";"(at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and Ican't go when I'm nervous."
"Chandler";"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey andyells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!"
"Rachel";"Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney."
"Monica";"Which one was Pete Carney?"
"Rachel";"Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we hadsex. (imitating) "Was it good for you?""
"Monica";"Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day overHoward-the-"I-win"-guy. (imitating) "I win! I win!" I went out withthe guy for two months—I didn't get to win once."
"Rachel";"How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!"
"Monica";"I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets."
"Phoebe";"I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch."
"Monica";"There's more beer, right?"
"Phoebe";"Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if youwant to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual."
"Rachel";"Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald."
"Phoebe";"Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day.It's perfect."
"Monica";"Ok, well, what kind of ritual?"
"Phoebe";"Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us."
"Rachel";"Or?"
"Phoebe";"Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks."
"Monica";"Burning's good."
"Rachel";"Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
"Lorraine";"You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarterswith my toes."
"Joey";"Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?"
"Janice";"By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want,I have a bag with just your heads."
"Chandler";"That's OK."
"Janice";"Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make littlepuppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty."
"Joey";"(to Lorraine) We can't do that."
"Chandler";"(disgusted) What? What can't you do?"
"Joey";"Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?"
"Joey";"Uh, we might be leaving now."
"Chandler";"Tell me it's "you and me" we."
"Joey";"She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'mnot even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it."
"Chandler";"Ok, you can not do this to me."
"Joey";"You're right, I'm sorry. You're right."
"Lorraine";"(to waiter) Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?"
"Joey";"I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry,Chandler."
"Chandler";"I hope she throws up on you."
"Chandler";"So..."
"Janice";"Just us."
"Chandler";"Oh, what a crappy night!"
"Janice";"Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin'outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom."
"Chandler";"Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up...other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?"
"Janice";"So, do we have the best friends or what?"
"Chandler";"Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card.Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?"
"Janice";"I will go for that drink."
"Chandler";"You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could weget a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?"
"Janice";"Each."
"Chandler";"That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've alwayswanted to know..."
"Janice";"Happy Valentine's Day!"
"Janice";"Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?"
"Chandler";"No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice."
"Janice";"Kiss me!"
"Monica";"Oh, Chandler, sorry."
"Monica";"Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice."
"Janice";"Hi, Monica."
"Chandler";"Ok, well, this was very special."
"Monica";"Rach, come see who's out here!"
"Rachel";"Oh my god. Janice, hi!"
"Chandler";"Janice is gonna go away now."
"Monica";"I'll be right back."
"Rachel";"Oh, Joey, look who it is."
"Joey";"(in disbelief) Whoa."
"Chandler";"Oh, good, Joey's home now."
"Janice";"This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall."
"Monica";"Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (toChandler) He just happened to call."
"Janice";"Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know? (she laughs obnoxiously)"
"Ross";"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the wholeum, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to LosAngeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
"Kristin";"That's funny. Who are they?"
"Ross";"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close,personal friend."
"Kristin";"You mean they're lovers."
"Ross";"If you wanna put a label on it."
"Kristin";"Wow, uh, anything else I should know?"
"Ross";"Nope, nope, that's it."
"Ross";"Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Caroland Susan) Helloo!"
"Phoebe";"Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine."
"Monica";"All I have is, is oregano and a"
"Phoebe";"Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semenof a righteous man."
"Rachel";"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing theritual in the first place."
"Monica";"Can we just start throwing things in?"
"Phoebe";"Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK."
"Rachel";"(tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxershorts."
"Phoebe";"Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah."
"Monica";"Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked."
"Rachel";"(looking at picture) Hey he's wearing a sweater."
"Monica";"No."
"Rachel and Phoebe";"Eww!"
"Rachel";"And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa."
"Monica";"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure..."
"Chandler";"How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?"
"Joey";"I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's."
"Chandler";"Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush."
"Janice";"Hello, funny Valentine."
"Chandler";"Hi, Just Janice."
"Janice";"Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, andI'm gonna!"
"Joey";"(to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will."
"Ross";"So, um, what do you do for a living?"
"Kristin";"Well, um, for the past few years I've been working..(Ross is watchingCarol and Susan, not listening to Kristin. Susan gets up, and has to go. Carol is leftstranded)...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major."
"Carol";"Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you."
"Susan";"I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.(Ross realizes Kristin was expecting him to laugh, so he starts to laugh hysterically.)"
"Ross";"Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invitedCarol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad."
"Kristin";"(reluctantly) I guess."
"Ross";"Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?"
"Carol";"Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine."
"Ross";"Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let'stry scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin.Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that,funnily enough, wasn't even her major!"
"Fireman No. 1";"What do we got there?"
"Fireman No. 2";"A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and whatlooks like a half-charred picture—Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!"
"Monica";"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened."
"Fireman No. 3";"It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. Thisisn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control."
"Fireman No. 1";"You're our third call tonight."
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Fireman No. 2";"Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year."
"Janice";"I brought you something."
"Chandler";"Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan andJan Forever."
"Janice";"I had them made special."
"Chandler";"Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tellyou this. At least there's no"
"Janice";"That's fine."
"Chandler";"(surprised) It is?"
"Janice";"Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end."
"Chandler";"Oh no, you see, actually it is."
"Janice";"No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet?You love me, Chandler Bing."
"Chandler";"Oh, no I don't."
"Janice";"Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending uptogether? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?"
"Chandler";"I did, but..."
"Janice";"You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like afoghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you knowit. You just don't know you know it. See ya."
"Chandler";"Call me!"
"Carol";"It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine."
"Ross";"You did so. I swear, I swear—(noticing Kristin's absence) How longhas she been in the bathroom?"
"Carol";"Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone."
"Ross";"Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I hadin 9 years."
"Carol";"That could be it."
"Ross";"Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is stillpretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it offand eats it.)"
"Carol";"Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even staythrough dinner. Sorry, that's not funny"
"Ross";"No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life"thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, andshe's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin'to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know,here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I knowwhat you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside fornow you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know.You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see,you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you."
"Carol";"Oh, I love you too. But..."
"Ross";"No but, no but."
"Carol";"You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time totake the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waitingfor you."
"Ross";"That's easy for you to say, you found one already."
"Carol";"All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set."
"Carol";"Not her."
"Fireman No. 3";"We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?"
"Rachel";"So, um, will you bring the truck?"
"Fireman No. 3";"I'll even let you ring the bell."
"Rachel";"Oh, my god."
"Phoebe";"See, there you go, the cleansing works!"
"Monica";"They're nice guys."
"Rachel";"Oh, they're firemen guys."
"Fireman No. 1";"You guys tell them you were married?"
"Fireman No. 2";"No way!"
"Fireman No. 3";"Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tellthem!"
"Monica";"Aww, thank you. (Notices something.) Uh Rach?"
"Rachel";"Oh! That's why. (Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamonstick.) I'm sorry!"
"Woman";"Chandler."
"Chandler";"Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a"
"Mrs. Tedlock";"Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at theend of the day."
"Chandler";"Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to dowith them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken fromthe woman.) Nothing."
"Phoebe";"Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, thisincredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know..."
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"All";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Never mind. But it was going to be really good."
"Ross";"What's going on?"
"All";"What is it?"
"Chandler";"So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Alcalls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
"All";"That's great!"
"Chandler";"So.... I quit."
"All";"Why?"
"Chandler";"Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!"
"Monica";"Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years."
"Chandler";"If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what Iactually do."
"Phoebe";"So was it a lot more money?"
"Chandler";"It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's inhis office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS."
"Rachel";"... the WENUS?"
"Chandler";"Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term."
"Rachel";"(sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS."
"Joey";"So what're you going to do?"
"Chandler";"I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I justknow I'm not going to figure it out working there."
"Phoebe";"Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client...Steve? (pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef."
"Monica";"(taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there."
"Phoebe";"Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know.You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs ajob right now, so...."
"Chandler";"Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it'san all-toast restaurant."
"Phoebe";"(to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah!"
"Phoebe";"Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone whocan, you know, create the entire menu."
"Monica";"(excited) Oh my God!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?"
"Chandler";"Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat."
"Phoebe";"OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!"
"Chandler";"Can you see my nipples through this shirt?"
"Rachel";"No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there."
"Phoebe";"Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?"
"Chandler";"Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, careercounselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the "a-gogo.""
"Rachel";"Career counselor?"
"Chandler";"Hey, you guys all know what you want to do."
"Rachel";"I don't!"
"Chandler";"Hey, you guys"
"Ross";"Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech."
"Monica";"Oh, I love my life, I love my life!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh!"
"Rachel";"The meeting with the guy went great?"
"Monica";"So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this,it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right."
"Chandler";"Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?"
"Monica";"So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind oflike an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for mebecause then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises."
"Rachel";"What are you going to make?"
"Phoebe";"(as though Rachel wasn't paying attention) Yummy noises."
"Rachel";"(pause) And Monica, what are"
"Monica";"I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel inthe kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with thestuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.(sits down)"
"Ross";"Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?"
"Joey";"How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."
"Ross";"OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?"
"Chandler";"Who are you going out with?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, is this the bug lady?"
"Rachel";"(trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross."
"Ross";"Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at themuseum."
"Rachel";"So what are you guys going to do?"
"Ross";"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring herback to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey."
"Chandler";"And he's"
"Joey";"(aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...(gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?"
"Ross";"Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures)huh-huh."
"Joey";"I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take onelook at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal."
"Ross";"Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you!Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel..."
"Celia";"I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my..."
"Ross";"Alright... (lifts Marcel away)"
"Monica";"(to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse."
"Joey";"(tasting) Mmmm. Good."
"Monica";"Is it better than the other salmon mousse?"
"Joey";"It's creamier."
"Monica";"Yeah, well, is that"
"Joey";"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'mkeeping it down, y'know?"
"Rachel";"My God! What happened to you?"
"Chandler";"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests,personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) "Youare ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinationalcorporation.""
"Phoebe";"That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!"
"Chandler";"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should bedoing something really"
"Rachel";"(comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh,hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!"
"Monica";"(brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'llcheer you up."
"Chandler";"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better splitthis with you."
"Monica";"It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call itan"
"Chandler";"(tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing..."
"Monica";"(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock.(Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) Allright, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)"
"Phoebe";"Ten dollars an hour for what?"
"Monica";"Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out."
"Rachel";"(hurt) Waitressing?"
"Joey";"Uh-oh."
"Monica";"Well... of course I thought of you! But... but..."
"Rachel";"But, but?"
"Monica";"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know?And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress."
"Rachel";"Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that Ican waitress in the Olympics."
"Chandler";"You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in'76. (dead silence)"
"Celia";"Talk to me."
"Ross";"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..."
"Celia";"No no no. Talk... dirty."
"Ross";"(embarrassed) Wha... what, here?"
"Celia";"Yes..."
"Ross";"Ah...."
"Celia";"Say something....."
"Ross";"(panicked) Er.... um....."
"Celia";"What?"
"Ross";"Um... uh.... vulva."
"Joey";"(in disbelief)"
"Ross";"Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but itwasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling."
"Joey";"(sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??"
"Ross";"Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kindof guy, you know?"
"Joey";"What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what youwant her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'lltell you what. Just try something on me."
"Ross";"(deadpan) Please be kidding."
"Joey";"Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd liketo be doing right now."
"Ross";"OK. (closes eyes) I'm in my apartment..."
"Joey";"....yeah... what else?"
"Ross";"That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having thisconversation. (gets up, walks across room)"
"Joey";"(walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I'll start, OK?"
"Ross";"Joey, please."
"Joey";"Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... Ross....you get me so hot. I want your lips on me"
"Ross";"(impressed) Wow."
"Joey";"Alright, now you say something."
"Ross";"I... ahem... I really don't think so."
"Joey";"Come on! You like this woman, right?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Joey";"You want to see her again, right?"
"Ross";"Sure."
"Joey";"Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her?Now tell me you want to caress my butt!"
"Ross";"OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you staring atme when I'm doing this."
"Joey";"(turning around) Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead."
"Ross";"Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with mylips."
"Joey";"There you go! Keep going. Keep going!"
"Ross";"I, er..."
"Ross";"I want to take my tongue... and..."
"Ross";"....and...."
"Joey";"Say it... say it!"
"Ross";"...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with..."
"Chandler";"(smiling)....with??"
"Ross";"(rushing to explain) Funny story!"
"Chandler";"It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to gettogether."
"Joey";"Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job calledagain."
"Chandler";"Again?"
"Joey";"And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (handsphone to Chandler) And again."
"Chandler";"(on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?(Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pensfrom your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look,this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something Ican really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure youmentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This isnot a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'mtelling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you onMonday! (slams the phone down)"
"Chandler";"Well?"
"Phoebe";"(excited) Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, thisis a cube."
"Chandler";"Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)"
"Phoebe";"Oh! You have a window!"
"Chandler";"Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of..."
"Phoebe";"Oh look! That guy's peeing!"
"Chandler";"(walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check thisout, look at this. Sit down, sit down."
"Phoebe";"(sitting) OK."

"Rachel";"Done."
"Rachel";"Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?"
"Monica";"Hi Steve!"
"Steve";"Hello, Monica. (to Rachel) Hello, greeter girl."
"Monica";"(to Steve) This is Rachel."
"Steve";"(unconcerned) Yeah, OK."
"Phoebe";"(overemphasizing) Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, Ican't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica signals her to stop)of, OK, smells."
"Steve";"It's a lovely apartment."
"Monica";"Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?"
"Steve";"I was just being polite, but, alright."

"Rachel";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?"
"Rachel";"OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK."
"Steve";"(from the living room) Is it dry in here? (licks his lips)"
"Rachel";"Let me, let me get you some wine!"
"Monica";"Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monicabrings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce...(Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (hefinishes)... ginger."
"Steve";"Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!"
"Monica";"I'm so glad you liked them!"
"Steve";"Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!"
"Monica";"Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and ahalf minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets."
"Steve";"Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. (he gets upand goes into the kitchen)"
"Rachel";"Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?"
"Steve";"You know, I don't know what I'm looking for."
"Steve";"(from kitchen) Ah, cool! Taco shells! (Rachel motions, "Yousee!") You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope."
"Monica";"(joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't wantto spoil your appetite."
"Steve";"(looking in cabinets) Hey! Sugar-O's! (grabs the cereal box)"
"Monica";"You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes..."
"Steve";"Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!"
"Monica";"No, we don't. (reaches for box)"
"Steve";"Oh, OK. (he drops the box on the floor) Oh, sorry. (When she bends downto pick it up he grabs a package of Gummi-bears from the cabinet.)"
"Monica";"Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then triesto secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears."
"Steve";"(childishly) No."
"Monica";"Give them to me."
"Steve";"Alright, we'll share."
"Monica";"No, give me the..."
"Steve";"Well then you can't have any. (she grabs for the package, and it breaksopen. Gummi-bears fly everywhere, some into the punch bowl on the table.) Bear overboard!I think he's drowning. (he throws some Sugar-O's into the punch bowl) Hey fellows! Grab ona Sugar-O... save yourself! (Mimicking the bears) "Help!  I'm drowning!  Help!""
"Monica";"(furious) That's it! Dinner is over!"
"Steve";"What?"
"Steve";"Why?"
"Monica";"Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity likethis, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?"
"Steve";"(excited) Hey!"
"Joey";"What a tool!"
"Rachel";"You don't want to work for a guy like that."
"Monica";"I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it."
"Ross";"Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef."
"Phoebe";"Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking."
"Joey";"(to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?"
"Ross";"Oh, I was unbelievable."
"Joey";"All right, Ross!"
"Ross";"I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filthyou have"
"Joey";"Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?"
"Ross";"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk,it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh..."
"Joey";"You cuddled."
"Ross";"Yeah, which was nice."
"Phoebe";"You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?"
"Rachel";"Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?"
"Joey";"Yeah, where the hell is he?"
"Chandler";"(on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at theWENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell yousomething... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slamsphone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa...."
"Phoebe";"How's this? (presses down hard)"
"Steve";"Eeeee!"
"Phoebe";"Sorry. How about over here? (presses down hard again)"
"Steve";"Aaaaah!"
"Phoebe";"See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? (presses downelsewhere)"
"Steve";"No."
"Phoebe";"What about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells inpain)"
"Chandler";": This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this was acartoon, you’d be looking like a ham right about now."
"Joey";": There’s the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?"
"Chandler";": It’s Phoebe! Hi!"
"Ursula";": Hi. Okay, will that be all?"
"Chandler";": Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?"
"Ursula";": Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, helloMiss," so now I’m here."
"Joey";": No, no... how come you are working here?"
"Ursula";": Right, yeah, ’cause its close to where I live, and the aprons arereally cute."
"Chandler";": Can we start over?"
"Ursula";": Yeah. Okay great. I’m gonna be over here. (She wanders away.)"
"Chandler and Joey";": No, no, no!"
"Ross";": I don’t know whether he’s testing me, or just acting out, but mymonkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine,"supposedly" by accident."
"Rachel";": No, yeah, I’ve done that."
"Ross";": And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, andpeed all over the crossword."
"Rachel";": I’ve never done that."
"Chandler";": All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look exactly likeher sister."
"Joey";": I’m sayin’ I see a difference."
"Chandler";": They’re twins!"
"Joey";": I don’t care. Phoebe’s Phoebe. Ursula’s... hot!"
"Chandler";": You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?"
"Joey";": Yeah."
"Chandler";": Let’s not do that any more."
"All";": Hey guys! Hey!"
"Joey";": Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today."
"Phoebe";": Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson."
"Joey";": Nope."
"Phoebe";": Morly Safer."
"Joey";": Nope."
"Phoebe";": The woman who cuts my hair!"
"Monica";": Okay, look, this could be a really long game."
"Chandler";": Your sister Ursula."
"Phoebe";": (Her face dropping) Oh, really."
"Chandler";": Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh..."
"Phoebe";": Rift’s. Yeah, I know."
"Chandler";": Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven’t talked in like years."
"Phoebe";": Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?"
"Joey";": Not from where"
"Phoebe";": (Turning to Chandler) where were you standing?"
"Rachel";": Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don’t get along?"
"Phoebe";": It’s mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyonealways thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one tostart walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then itwas like "yeah, right, well what else is new?""
"Ross";": Oh, Pheebs, I’m sorry, I’ve got to go. I’ve got Lamaze class."
"Chandler";": Oh, and I’ve got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym."
"Rachel";": So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?"
"Ross";": No, Susan’s gonna be there too. We’ve got dads, we’ve gotlesbians, the whole parenting team."
"Rachel";": Well, isn’t, isn’t that gonna be weird?"
"Ross";": No, no. (Distractedly putting on a jacket to go out) I mean, it mighta beenat first, but by now I, I think I’m pretty comfortable with the whole situation."
"Monica";": Ross, that’s"
"Ross";": I know."
"Woman";": Hi, we’re the Rostins. Err, I’m J.C., and he’s Michael, andwe’re having a boy,"
"Teacher";": Good for you. Alrighty, next?"
"Ross";": Hi, um, I’m err, (has to clear his throat) I’m Ross Geller, and errah... (pats Carol’s bulge) ..that’s, that’s my boy in there, and uh,(points) this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carol’s,just, com... (embarrassment finally overwhelms the poor fellow, who becomes incoherentuntil) ..who’s next?"
"Teacher";": I’m sorry, I didn’t get... Susan is?"
"Ross";": Susan is Carol’s, Carol’s, Carol’s, friend..."
"Carol";": Life partner."
"Ross";": Like buddies."
"Susan";": Like lovers."
"Ross";": You know how close women can get."
"Carol";": Susan and I live together."
"Ross";": Although I was married to her."
"Susan";": Carol, not me."
"Ross";": Err, right."
"Carol";": It’s a little complicated."
"Ross";": A little."
"Susan";": But we’re fine."
"Ross";": Absolutely. (Turns back to the woman next to him.) So, twins... hah!That’s like two births. (He struggles again.) Ouch."
"Chandler";": And (he imitates the buzzer) to you too, Helen."
"Helen";": (Over the intercom) Nina Bookbinder is here to see you."
"Chandler";": Oh, okay. Send her in."
"Nina";": Hi."
"Chandler";": Hi, Nina. Come on in."
"Nina";": You wanted to see me?"
"Chandler";": Uh, Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here, and littlething, you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers."
"Nina";": Which is bad, because?"
"Chandler";": Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack."
"Nina";": Your... excuse me?"
"Chandler";": WENUS. (Coughs) Weekly Estimated Net..."
"Nina";": Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Won’t happen again. Iwouldn’t want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus.""
"Chandler";": It’s not just that she’s cute, okay. It’s just that...she’s really really cute."
"Ross";": It doesn’t matter. You don’t dip your pen in the company ink."
"Monica";": Ross, your little creature’s got the remote again."
"Ross";": Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie theremote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote..."
"Monica";": Great."
"Ross";": Relax, I’ll fix it."
"Rachel";": (Looking at the television) Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is"Urkel.""
"Ross";": (looking at the remote) How did he do this?"
"Chandler";": (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving theChristmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?"
"Monica";": Ah no, you see,"
"Rachel";": Well,"
"Chandler";": Hey, where you been?"
"Joey";": I went back to Riff’s. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered wascoffee, she brought me a tuna melt"
"Chandler";": Score."
"Joey";": She is so hot!"
"Chandler";": Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna runit by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)"
"Joey";": Pheebs?"
"Phoebe";": (Jumping up) Yeah?"
"Joey";": You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?"
"Phoebe";": Why? Why would you wanna... do that?  Why?"
"Joey";": So that if we went out on a date, she’d be there."
"Phoebe";": Well, I mean, I’m not my sister’s, you know, whatever, and um...I mean, it’s true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we’ve grown apart,so, um... I don’t know, why not? Okay."
"Joey";": Cool, thanks."
"Ross";": You okay?"
"Phoebe";": Yeah I’m fine."
"Ross";": You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?"
"Ross";": Sorry."
"Ross";": Hi. Sorry I’m late. Where’s, where’s Carol?"
"Susan";": Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I’ll get theinformation."
"Ross";": No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both knowwhat’s going on."
"Susan";": Oh, good. This’ll be fun."
"Teacher";": Alrighty. We’re gonna start with some basic third stage breathingexercises, so Mummies, why don’t you get on your back? And... coaches, you should besupporting Mummy’s head."
"Ross and Susan";": What? What? What?"
"Susan";": I am supposed to be the mommy?"
"Ross";": Okay, I’m gonna play my sperm card"
"Susan";": Look, I don’t see why I should have to miss out on the coachingtraining just because I’m a woman."
"Ross";": I see. So what do you propose to do?"
"Susan";": I will flip you for it."
"Ross";": Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!"
"Susan";": (Triumphantly) On your back... Mom."
"Teacher";": Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath."
"Teacher";": Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower."
"Chandler";": Mr. D, how’s it going, sir?"
"Mr. Douglas";": Ohh, it’s been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in."
"Chandler";": And?"
"Mr. Douglas";": It’s pretty ugly. We haven’t seen an ANUS this bad since theseventies."
"Chandler";": So what does this mean?"
"Mr. Douglas";": Well, we’re gonna be layin’ off people in every department."
"Chandler";": Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and myhair was very very &ndash;"
"Mr. Douglas";": Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?"
"Chandler";": Nina? Nina. (He goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) Nina. (Inpain) Nina."
"Nina";": Are you okay?"
"Chandler";": (Looking down at her hand) Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that Icalled you in here today was, err... please don’t hate me."
"Nina";": (Taking her hand away) What?"
"Chandler";": (Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?"
"Rachel";": So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?"
"Phoebe";": Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me."
"Rachel";": Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from"
"Phoebe";": Ooh! Bath salts would be nice."
"Rachel";": Ooh, okay... good."
"Jamie";": What is this place?"
"Fran";": Look, you’re cold, I have to pee, and... (indicating the sign)..there’s a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?"
"Jamie";": I think we have an answer."
"Fran";": What’s she doing here?"
"Jamie";": This could be God’s way of telling us to eat at home."
"Fran";": Think she got fired at Riff’s?"
"Jamie";": No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept... (shuddering at the memory)..bringing swordfish. (Indicating the ladies’ bathroom) are you gonna go to the, um?"
"Fran";": I’m gonna wait till after we order. It’s her, right."
"Jamie";": It looks like her."
"Jamie";": Um, excuse me."
"Phoebe";": Yeah?"
"Jamie";": Hi, it’s us."
"Phoebe";": (Smiling blankly) Right, and it’s me."
"Jamie";": So, so you’re here too?"
"Phoebe";": Much as you are."
"Jamie";": (Without moving her lips) Your turn."
"Fran";": Err... we know what we want."
"Phoebe";": (Philosophically) Oh, that’s good."
"Jamie";": All we want is two Caffe Lattes."
"Fran";": And some biscottie cookies."
"Phoebe";": Good choice."
"Jamie";": Definitely her."
"Fran";": Yeah."
"Monica";": I can’t believe you. You still haven’t told that girl shedoesn’t have a job yet?"
"Chandler";": Well, you still haven’t taken down the Christmas lights."
"Monica";": Congratulations, I think you’ve found the world’s thinnestargument."
"Chandler";": I’m just trying to find the right moment, you know?"
"Rachel";": Oh, well, that shouldn’t be so hard, now that you’re dating.(Imitating men at their worst) "Sweetheart, you’re fired, but how ’bout aquickie before I go to work?""
"Joey";": Hey."
"Rachel and Chandler";": Hey."
"Chandler";": You know, once you’re inside, you don’t have to knock any more."
"Monica";": I’ll get it."
"Monica";": Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles."
"Mr.Heckles";": You’re doing it again."
"Monica";": We’re not doing anything. We’re just sitting around talking,quietly."
"Mr.Heckles";": I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can’t sleep."
"Rachel";": You don’t even have cats."
"Mr.Heckles";": I could have cats."
"Monica";": (Closing the door) Goodbye Mr.Heckles."
"Rachel";": We’ll try to keep it down."
"Joey";": Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna makesure it fits."
"Phoebe";": Ooh, my first birthday present... (delightedly examining the cardigan inher lap) ..oh, this is really..."
"Joey";": Oh, no no no. It’s for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise."
"Phoebe";": Ohhh... Sure, yeah... (disgustedly dropping the cardigan back into the bag)..okay, it fits."
"Rachel";": Are you seein’ her again tonight?"
"Joey";": Yep. Ice Capades."
"Chandler";": Wow, this is serious. I’ve never known you to pay money for any kindof capade."
"Joey";": I don’t know. I like her, you know. She’s different. There’suh, somethin’ about her."
"Phoebe";": That you like, (snappily confronting Joey over the heads of the knittingcircle) we get it. You like her. Great!"
"Joey";": Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay."
"Phoebe";": Alright, well, maybe now it’s not okay."
"Joey";": Okay... Well maybe now I’m not okay with it not being okay."
"Phoebe";": Okay."
"Chandler";": Knit, good woman, knit, knit!"
"Chandler";": And that’s the Chrysler Building right there."
"Mr. Douglas";": Nina."
"Nina";": Mr.Douglas... (flirting defensively) ..cool tie."
"Mr. Douglas";": (Shutting the door, then pointing vaguely at Nina’s shapelydeparture) She’s still here."
"Chandler";": Yes, yes she is. Didn’t I memo you on this? See, after I let her go,err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan."
"Chandler";": And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact,he uh, mentioned the word frenzy."
"Mr. Douglas";": You’re kidding? She seems so..."
"Chandler";": Oh, no, no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she iswhooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have norecollection of being fired at all, none at all."
"Mr. Douglas";": That’s unbelievable."
"Chandler";": And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can beassured that she will be no threat to herself, or others."
"Mr. Douglas";": I see. I guess you never really know what’s goin’ on insidea person’s head."
"Chandler";": Well, I guess that’s why they call it psychology, sir."
"Soothing male voice";": ..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is themiracle of birth."
"Teacher";": Lights please? And that’s having a baby. Next week is our finalclass."
"Ross";": Susan, go deep."
"Carol";": This is impossible. It’s just impossible."
"Susan";": What is, honey?"
"Carol";": What that woman... did. I am"
"Ross";": Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything’s gonna be alright."
"Carol";": (screaming at Ross) Oh, what do you know?  No one's going up to you andsaying, "Hi, is that your nostril?  Mind if we push this"
"Susan";": Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath."
"Susan";": I know it’s frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just oneday, and when it’s over, we’re all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives."
"Susan";": I mean, that’s what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?"
"Ross";": I’m gonna be a father."
"Rachel";": This is just occurring to you?"
"Ross";": I always knew I was havin’ a baby, I just never realised the baby washaving me."
"Rachel";": (She comforts him too) Oh, you’re gonna be great!"
"Ross";": Aw, how can you say that? I can’t even get Marcel to stop eating thebath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?"
"Chandler";": You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys andbabies are actually different."
"Phoebe";": Where’re you going?"
"Joey";": Out."
"Phoebe";": With?"
"Joey";": (Spreading his arms wide) Yes."
"Phoebe";": Alright, could I just ask you one question?"
"Phoebe";": Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?"
"Joey";": Well, not that it’s any of your business, but, no, we haven’t,okay?"
"Joey";": You meant sex, right?"
"Nina";": Do you have a sec?"
"Chandler";": Ah, sure, Nina. What’s up?"
"Nina";": I don’t know. For the past couple days, people have been"
"Chandler";": Oh, well, ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous, ofus."
"Nina";": Maybe. But that doesn’t explain why they keep taking my scissors."
"Chandler";": Ah, well, maybe that’s, ah, because you’re getting a big raise."
"Nina";": I am?"
"Chandler";": Sure, why not?"
"Nina";": Oh my god! (Rushing over to give him a big hug) You’re amazing!"
"Chandler";": Oh, you don’t know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you make surewe put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder’s raise?"
"Helen";": (Over the intercom) So you still want me to send her psychological profileto Personnel?"
"Nina";": What?"
"Chandler";": Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?"
"Chandler";": Well, I ended up telling her everything."
"Rachel";": Oh, how’d she take it?"
"Chandler";": Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.)Little tip: if you’re ever in a similar situation, never"
"Monica";": Okay, I think I get how to do this."
"Phoebe";": Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them goaway? Because I can’t, I can’t watch."
"Monica";": (Remotely turning off the television) okay, Pheebs, they’re gone."
"Phoebe";": Okay."
"Monica";": Are you alright?"
"Phoebe";": Yeah. It’s just, you know, it’s this whole stupid"
"Rachel";": Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he’s going out with her. I mean, is itreally so terrible?"
"Phoebe";": Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I’m not saying she’s like"
"Monica and Rachel";": (Wistfully, shaking their heads) No."
"Phoebe";": Well, but that’s what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stolehim away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn’t even"
"Rachel";": Oh... Oh, Pheebs."
"Phoebe";": I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but..."
"Chandler";": You’re not gonna lose him."
"Monica";": Hon, you gotta talk to Joey."
"Phoebe";": Yeah. Okay."
"Ross";": No, come on, he doesn’t know this stuff. If he knew how you felt."
"Phoebe";": But he’s falling in"
"Rachel";": Oh please, they’ve been going out a week. They haven’t even slepttogether yet, I mean, that’s not serious."
"Phoebe";": Okay... Okay."
"Phoebe";": Oh, okay, oh."
"Ursula";": (Surprised) Oh."
"Ursula";": Yeah, um, may we help you?"
"Monica";": Rachel, what are you doing? It’s freezing out here. Would you comeback inside?"
"Rachel";": No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... (she climbs onto therailing to reach the top of a pole) ..I’m takin’ ’em down. Okay? Whoa!(Screams.)"
"Monica";": Oh-my-god Rachel! (Rushing out to look over the edge) Rachel!"
"Rachel";": (To Monica) I’m okay! I’m okay! (She knocks on Mr. Heckles'swindow.) Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?"
"Mr.Heckles";": See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about."
"Rachel";": Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow."
"Monica";": Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and shefell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something."
"Nurse";": My god. You still have your Christmas lights up?"
"Nurse";": Fill this out and bring it back to me."
"Rachel";": Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow."
"Monica";": Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?"
"Rachel";": You."

"Rachel";": Yeah."
"Monica";": Oh, that is so sweet. (Touched, she puts an arm around her friend andkisses her.) Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?"
"Rachel";": Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that."
"Monica";": (No longer touched) you don't have insurance?"
"Rachel";": Why, how much is this gonna cost?"
"Monica";": I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars."
"Rachel";": Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?"
"Monica";": Well there's not much we can do."
"Rachel";": (Like a big baby) Um... unless, unless I use yours."
"Monica";": Hah, no no no no no no no no no no."
"Rachel";": (Tapping the clipboard) well, now, wait a second, who did I just put asmy "In case of emergency" person?"
"Monica";": (Looking around to check that no-one's listening, then lowering hervoice anyway) That's insurance fraud."
"Rachel";": Well, alright, then, forget it. (Getting up to go) Might as well just gohome. Ow ow ow ow!"
"Monica";": (Jumping up to make Rachel sit down) Okay, okay. I hate this."
"Rachel";": Thank you. Thank you. I love you."
"Monica";": (to the nurse) Hi, (tiny laugh) um, I'm gonna need a new set of (tinylaugh) these forms (tiny laugh)."
"Nurse";": Why?"
"Monica";": (Tiny laugh) I am really an idiot. (Tiny laugh) you see, I was fillingout my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, (tiny laugh) I put mine."
"Nurse";": You"
"Monica";": (Tiny laugh) yep, that's me, (tiny laugh) I am"
"Ross";": I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid."
"Chandler and Joey";": That's nice."

"Ross";"Alright boys, let's eat."
"Chandler";"Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
"Ross";"You still on that?"
"Chandler";"Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking):"When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!""
"Ross";"You are way off, pal."
"Joey";"No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her."
"Ross";"Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time—not anymore. I just—I..."
"Ross";"Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?"
"Ross";"You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK—if you press thatbutton, you are in very, very big trouble."

"Monica";"What?"
"Rachel";"Oh my God!"

"All";"That's great! That's wonderful!"
"Rachel";"Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story..."

"Rachel";"No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go."
"Ross";"Alright."

"Joey";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it."
"Chandler";"That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This wayI can break 'em up with a movie."
"Ross";"Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen..."
"Rachel";"Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, Ihave to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)"
"Monica";"You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we willwin, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every lastdime you have, and you will hate yourselves"
"Rachel";"Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon."
"Ross";"So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to gothrough the formality of actually playing."
"Rachel";"Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy."
"Monica";"OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?"
"Phoebe";"(holding a card and waving it in front of her face) Hey you guys, look,the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. (they look at her) Right, OK, serious poker."
"Monica";"Excuse me, where are you going?"
"Ross";"Uh... to the bathroom."
"Monica";"Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?"
"Ross";"I want to go to the bathroom. (exits)"
"Joey";"Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. (gets up)"
"Rachel";"Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the storecloses at nine, so you can eat then."

"Ross";"Alright. (to Rachel): Your money's mine, Green."
"Rachel";"Your fly is open, Geller. (he checks it, and zips up)"
"Phoebe";"You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.'Coincidence?"
"Chandler";"Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!"

"Rachel";"Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! (lays downcards) I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what? (collects chips) I think I'm gonnamake a little Ross pile. (holds up a chip) I think that one was Ross's, and Ithink—oh—that one was Ross's. Yes! (Starts singing):"
"Rachel";"And your fly's still open..."
"Rachel";"Ha, I made you look...."
"Rachel";"I couldn't be inner. Monica?"
"Phoebe";"Monica, in or out?"
"Monica";"(slams down cards) I hate this game!"
"Phoebe";"OK Joey, your bet."
"Joey";"Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guywith sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) Oh, I'm out."
"Phoebe";"Ross?"
"Ross";"Oh, I am very in."
"Phoebe";"Chandler?"
"Chandler";"Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)"
"Phoebe";"Me too. Rachel."
"Rachel";"Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. (throws chips in pot) What doyou say... want to waste another buck?"
"Ross";"No, not this time. (he folds) So... what'd you have?"
"Rachel";"I'm not telling. (collects chips)"
"Ross";"Come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up)"
"Rachel";"No..!"
"Ross";"Show them to me!"
"Rachel";"Get your hands out of there! No!"
"Ross";"Let me see! Show them!"
"Chandler";"Y'know, I've had dates like this."
"Rachel";"(deals new hand) Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Yourwhole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple..."
"Phoebe";"Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants."
"Ross";"First of all, I'm not losing..."
"Rachel";"Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. (phone rings)"
"Ross";"Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the..."
"Rachel";"(answering phone) Hel-lo, Rachel Green."

"Monica";"Sorry, Rach."
"Phoebe";"Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff."
"Rachel";"Yeah...(sigh)....OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh...jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante."
"Joey";"Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this."
"Rachel";"Yes, we do. (pause)"
"Monica";"Alright, check."
"Joey";"Check."
"Ross";"I'm in for fifty cents. (throws it in)"
"Chandler";"Call."
"Phoebe";"I'm in."
"Rachel";"I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. (throws itin)"
"Ross";"I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit."
"Rachel";"Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Doesanybody have a problem with that?"
"Rachel";"(to Ross): Loser?"
"Ross";"No, I fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)"
"Rachel";"What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?"
"Ross";"I'm in. (throws in chips)"
"Rachel";"How many you want?"
"Ross";"One. (Rachel gives him the card.)"
"Rachel";"Dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) What do you bet?"
"Ross";"I bet two dollars. (throws it in)"
"Rachel";"OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. (throws it in)"
"Ross";"I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)"
"Rachel";"See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse."
"Monica";"Rachel, there's nothing in it."
"Rachel";"OK, then get me your purse."
"Monica";"OK, here you go. Good luck."
"Rachel";"(to Monica): Thank you. (to Ross): I saw your twenty-five, and I raiseyou... seven."
"Phoebe";"...teen! (throws in a ten-dollar bill)"

"Joey";"That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?"
"Chandler";"(to Ross): What do you need, what do you need?"
"Ross";"Fifteen."
"Chandler";"Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)"
"Joey";"Here, I got five, I got five. (Ross takes the money)"
"Ross";"Thank you."
"Chandler";"Good luck."
"Ross";"(to Rachel): OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?"
"Rachel";"(lays down cards) Full house."
"Ross";"You got me."
"Joey";"(to Ross): Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat."
"Chandler";"(to Ross): I thought we had them!"
"Ross";"Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, youknow. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)"
"Rachel";"Oh, time's up."
"Monica";"(pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye..."
"Joey";"Oh!"
"Phoebe";"That's a"
"Rachel";"OK, OK, it's my turn. (reads the answer)"
"Chandler";"Go."
"Ross";"Uh.... bean! Bean!"
"Joey";"(triumphantly)"
"Rachel";"Yes!"
"Rachel";"Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, CinnamonStick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. LemonSoother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? (Guy shakes his head) Okay."
"Monica";"Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven."
"Rachel";"Thank you. (Examines it) Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!"
"Monica";"Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?"
"Rachel";"Oh. Right. ...Oh great."
"Monica";"What is it?"
"Rachel";"Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!"
"Monica";"Barry who you almost...?"
"Rachel";"Barry who I almost."
"Monica";"And Mindy, your maid of...?"
"Rachel";"Mindy, my maid of. Oh!"
"Monica";"(Takes it) That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. (Sees Rachel's look) Lucky.To have had a friend like you."
"Ross";"Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Goodboy. C'mere, gimme the rice. (Marcel brings the rice) Thank you, good boy. Well, I seehe's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (Rachelignores him) 'Bring me the' and- Rach?"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Ross";"Hi."
"Rachel";"Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? Ishould be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them."
"Ross";"Really."
"Rachel";"No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody."
"Ross";"Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done withmen!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?"
"Rachel";"Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the rightguy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. WithPaolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual..."
"Ross";"Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there."
"Rachel";"Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who'slike, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?"
"Ross";"Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someonewho you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who..."
"Monica";"Hi."
"Ross";"...Gets interrupted. Hi!"
"Rachel";"Hi, how was the movie?"
"Monica";"Wonderful!"
"Phoebe";"So good!"
"Joey";"Suck-fest."
"Chandler";"Toootal chick-flick."
"Phoebe";"I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns andbombs and, like, buses going really fast..."
"Joey";"Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's alittle nudity."
"Monica";"There was nudity!"
"Joey";"I meant"
"Phoebe";"Phoebe:"
"Ross";"Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath.Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are."
"Chandler";"They're still just friends, right?"
"Rachel";"(To Marcel) And I will see you tomorrow!"
"Ross";"That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you."
"Monica";"Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?"
"Ross";"'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna bethere."
"Chandler";"I can't believe we are even having this discussion."
"Joey";"I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief."
"Chandler";"I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, theywould've happened already?"
"Ross";"I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someoneexactly like me."
"Joey";"She really said that?"
"Ross";"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking forsomeone, and someone is gonna be there tonight."
"Joey";"'Tonight' tonight?"
"Ross";"Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, shespent all day taking care of my monkey..."
"Chandler";"I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey."
"Ross";"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go overthere and, uh, try to woo her."
"Chandler";"Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the1890's, when that phrase was last used."
"Rachel";"Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she usedto be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying.Okay- (Marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing withMonica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in theshoe? (Takes the shoe into the kitchen) Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! (She notices thenewsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) Sorry, Barry.Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. (She leaves the apartmentholding the newsletter at arm's length. However, she leaves the door open. Marcel runs outin the opposite direction. There is a shot from the TV and Rachel runs back in) Who died?Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,right Marcel? Because- (Looks down and notices he is missing) Marcel? Marc- (Notices theopen door)"
"Joey";"How could you lose him?"
"Rachel";"I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-"
"Monica";"Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?"
"Rachel";"I don't know. The left one."
"Monica";"Which"
"Rachel";"Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything."
"Phoebe";"(Entering) Hey."
"Phoebe";"Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?"
"Chandler";"Rachel lost Marcel."
"Phoebe";"Oh no, how?"
"Monica";"He- he pooped in my shoe."
"Phoebe";"Which one?"
"Monica";"Those cute little black ones I wear all the time."
"Phoebe";"No, which"
"Rachel";"C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?"
"Joey";"Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do yougo?"
"Chandler";"Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some ofthe touristy things. I'll go to"
"Rachel";"Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonnakill me!"
"Monica";"Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and secondfloor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth."
"Rachel";"Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?"
"Monica";"Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray"
"Rachel";"Anybody wanna trade? Oh..."
"Mr. Heckles";"Whaddyou want?"
"Monica";"Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?"
"Mr. Heckles";"I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?"
"Monica";"No!"
"Phoebe";"Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?"
"Mr. Heckles";"I wasn't ready for it."
"Monica";"A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?"
"Mr. Heckles";"Saw Regis Philbin once..."
"Phoebe";"Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. (They move off)"
"Mr. Heckles";"You owe me a waffle."
"Rachel";"(On the phone) Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a whiteface... (Enter Ross) ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay.Thanks."
"Ross";"Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?"
"Rachel";"Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?"
"Ross";"Yeah. You, uh, you want some?"
"Rachel";"Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink ithere. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?"
"Ross";"Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murdercapital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how wewere, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (Uncorks the wine)Well-"
"Rachel";"Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this."
"Ross";"Okay, quick and painful. (Starts to cork the wine)"
"Rachel";"Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me."
"Ross";"Oh, what? What-what?"
"Rachel";"Y'know Marcel?"
"Ross";"...Yeah?"
"Rachel";"Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him."
"Ross";"(Angry) I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to dowas keep him in the apartment."
"Rachel";"I know, I know, I'm sorry-"
"Ross";"No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've,uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or apencil."
"Rachel";"(Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybodylooking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh! Who is it?"
"Rachel";"See? I've even called Animal Control!"
"Ross";"You called Animal Control?"
"Rachel";"Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?"
"Ross";"Marcel is an"
"Rachel";"O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that..."
"Ross";"That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to theapartment!"
"Rachel";"Hi, thanks for coming."
"Rachel";"Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! (Ross puts hisarms around her and they act all sweetness and light)"
"Ross";"Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't."
"Rachel";"Turned out it was a hat."
"Ross";"Cat!"
"Rachel";"Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!"
"Monica";"Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel."
"Luisa";"Marcel?"
"Ross";"My uncle Marcel."
"Phoebe";"Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?"
"Luisa";"Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh,punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?"
"Monica";"Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly toyourself first?"
"Phoebe";"Yes, but there isn't always time!"
"Monica";"Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have aseat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller."
"Luisa";"Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!"
"Rachel";"Yeah!"
"Luisa";"Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!"
"Rachel";"Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!"
"Monica";"The Luisa from home room!"
"Rachel";"Yes!!"
"Luisa";"You have no idea who I am, do you."
"Monica";"No, none at all."
"Rachel";"None."
"Luisa";"Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean,would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?"
"Monica";"Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!"
"Luisa";"Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. (ToRachel) But you? What a"
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Monica";"Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on thatmonkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?"
"Luisa";"I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. (Leaves)"
"Phoebe";"Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry."
"Chandler";"Marcel?"
"Joey";"Marcel?"
"Chandler";"Marcel?"
"Joey";"Marcel?"
"Woman No. 1";"Hi, can I help you?"
"Chandler";"Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking forsomething..."
"Joey";"A monkey."
"Chandler";"Yes have you seen any?"
"Woman No. 1";"No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixingradiators?"
"Joey";"Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?"
"Woman No. 1";"Of course."
"Joey";"Oh. Then, no."
"Woman No. 2";"Did I put too much rum in here?"
"Woman No. 1";"Just a sec. (To Chandler and Joey) Hope you find your monkey. (Shestarts to shut the door)"
"Chandler";"Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything aboutradiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating andcooling... mileu."
"Joey";"Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?"
"Chandler";"Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they'revery hot."
"Joey";"We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry,but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answersto the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping usout."
"Chandler";"Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people."
"Joey";"Marcel?"
"Chandler";"Marcel?!"
"Phoebe";"Marcel?"
"Monica";"Marcel?"
"Phoebe";"Marcel?"
"Phoebe";"Oh-my-God!"
"Monica";"Whaaat!"
"Phoebe";"Something just brushed up against my right leg!"
"Monica";"What is it?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg."
"Monica";"Look, Phoebe!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!"
"Luisa";"Step aside, ladies! (She loads a gun)"
"Monica";"What're you gonna do?"
"Luisa";"Just a small tranquiliser."
"Monica";"Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! (Marcel runs off and Luisa runs afterhim. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her inthe butt and removes it) Huh. (Sways back) Whoah."
"Monica";"Oh gosh."
"Ross";"Marcel?"
"Rachel";"Marcel?"
"Ross";"Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He'sgone, he's-he's just gone."
"Rachel";"Ross, you don't know that."
"Ross";"Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. (Kicks asign in frustration) And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot!Thank you very much."
"Rachel";"Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do?You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks thesign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you"
"Ross";"Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcelany more!"
"Rachel";"Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose."
"Ross";"Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sortof happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totallyoblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings..."
"Rachel";"Ross."
"Ross";"I don't even wanna hear it, you're just..."
"Rachel";"Ross."
"Ross";"Oh, forget it, okay?"
"Rachel";"Ross!"
"Ross";"What? What?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and theother side has no idea."
"Ross";"Hi, did you order some bananas?"
"Mr. Heckles";"What about it?"
"Ross";"Gimme back my monkey."
"Mr. Heckles";"I don't have a monkey."
"Rachel";"Then what's with all the bananas?"
"Mr. Heckles";"Potassium."
"Ross";"Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?"
"Ross";"Marcel! What've you done to him?"
"Mr. Heckles";"That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey."
"Ross";"Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. (Marcel starts to go to him)"
"Mr. Heckles";"C'mere, Patti. (Marcel turns round)"
"Ross";"C'mere, Marcel. (Turns to Ross)"
"Mr. Heckles";"C'mere, Patti. (Turns to Mr. Heckles)"
"Luisa";"(Out of shot) Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! (Marcel runs tothe door and into Luisa's cage, which she slams shut) Gotcha."
"Ross";"Okay, gimme my monkey back."
"Mr. Heckles";"That's"
"Luisa";"You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge."
"Mr. Heckles";"That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send thatback whenever."
"Ross";"Alright, I want my monkey."
"Luisa";"No!"
"Rachel";"Oh, c'mon, Luisa!"
"Luisa";"Sorry, prom queen."
"Ross";"(To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've beenfat."
"Rachel";"Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecomingqueen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, Iwill lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, butplease do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here!Take it!"
"Luisa";"Nope."
"Rachel";"Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her thatyou shot my friend in the ass with a dart?"
"Ross";"It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. (Marcelresists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine."
"Rachel";"Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great littleoutfit."
"Ross";"Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I..."
"Rachel";"Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your..."
"Ross";"Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great....Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh,something grape?"
"Rachel";"That'd be good."
"Ross";"Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off themain light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must bevacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we're here and, uh,not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and,um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um..."
"Rachel";"Barry?!"
"Rachel";"Rachel:"
"Ross";"We have got to start locking that door!"
"Monica";"This is me in"
"Phoebe";"Nope."
"Monica";"That's because I'm in front of them."
"Chandler";"Eh. I thought that was an alp."
"Monica";"Well, high school was not my favourite time."
"Joey";"I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of partiesand dating and sex."
"Chandler";"Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex Ihad would've involved a major lifestyle choice."
"Monica";"Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?"
"Chandler";"I can't believe you would actually say that. I would muchrather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty."
"Joey";"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughestsnack there is."
"Ross";"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy."
"Monica";"(looking out of the window) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come seethis! There's some creep out there with a telescope!"
"Ross";"I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!"
"Rachel";"Oh, that is so sick."
"Chandler";"I feel violated. And not in a good way."
"Phoebe";"How can people do that?... (All but Phoebe walk away from the window indisgust.) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!"
"Chandler";"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as oneof the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally beourselves, we didn't have to play any games..."
"Monica";"So have you called her yet?"
"Chandler";"Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls makedisgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'mright, right?"
"Joey and Ross";"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle."
"Monica";"I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of youpeople."
"Phoebe";"Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being sotestosteroney!"
"Chandler";"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, thenhurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine."
"Joey";"Her answer machine?"
"Chandler";"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up."
"Phoebe";"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?"
"Chandler";"Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended upusing the phrase "Yes indeedy-o.""
"Monica";"Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!"
"Ross";"Okay, okay, what's going on?"
"Phoebe";"Okay, they're just talking..."
"Ross";"Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told toshove anything?"
"Phoebe";"No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!"
"Ross";"What? What? What?!"
"Phoebe";"That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!"
"Chandler";"(bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law."
"All";"Oh!... Right!"
"Chandler";"Hey Rach!"
"Monica";"How'd it go?"
"Rachel";"Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunchat the"
"Phoebe";"Not a good day for birds..."
"Rachel";"Then we took a walk down to"
"Ross";"That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling,stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?"
"Rachel";"Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just sonice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!"
"Ross";"That's, that's nice twice!"
"Monica";"Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you leftat the altar?"
"Joey";"Duh, where've you been?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like,Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?"
"Chandler";"Yes!"
"Rachel";"Why?"
"Chandler";"I have my reasons."
"Monica";"Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who justhappens to be your ex-best friend?"
"Rachel";"All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it'sstupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!"
"Rachel";"Wow... Wow!"
"Barry";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that."
"Barry";"Nooo, it wasn't."
"Rachel";"Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here..."
"Chandler";"(on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting themachine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangsup.) Oh God!"
"Chandler";"Hey, I've been honing!"
"Ross";"What was with the dishes?"
"Chandler";"Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? Imight have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the pastfew hours."
"Monica";"(looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy withthe telescope!"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking inhere!"
"Monica";"Great, now he's waving back."
"Joey";"Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught himlooking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!"
"Monica";"What kinda stuff?"
"Joey";"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'mcooking naked."
"Phoebe";"You cook naked?"
"Joey";"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters."
"Chandler";"What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that."
"Barry";"What's the matter?"
"Rachel";"Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good."
"Barry";"No, it was. It was very very good."
"Rachel";"Well, what about Mindy?"
"Barry";"Oh, way, way better than Mindy."
"Rachel";"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
"Barry";"Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her."
"Rachel";"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me."
"Bernice";"(over intercom) Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment."
"Barry";"(into intercom) Thanks, Bernice. (To Rachel) Let's go away this weekend."
"Rachel";"Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.."
"Barry";"We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been ourhoneymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it."
"Rachel";"I had a bra."
"Bobby";"Hey, Dr. Farber."
"Barry";"All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we'restarting to see some real progress here."
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Bobby";"I'm twelve, I'm not stupid."
"Chandler";"Can I use your phone?"
"Monica";"Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also beused as a phone."
"Chandler";"Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?"
"Joey";"Maybe she never got your message."
"Phoebe";"Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot ofbeeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet."
"Chandler";"Y'don't think that makes me seem a little..."
"Ross";"...desperate, needy, pathetic?"
"Chandler";"Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad."
"Phoebe";"How many beeps?"
"Chandler";"She answered."
"Monica";"Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about."
"Chandler";"I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and ischoosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy."
"All";"Hey! Hi!"
"Phoebe";"How'd he take it?"
"Rachel";"Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)"
"Monica";"(wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss inyour hair?"
"Rachel";"Oh, do I?"
"Monica";"Uh huh."
"Rachel";"(in a low voice) We ended up having sex in his chair."
"Monica";"You had"
"Ross";"You-you had what?"
"Phoebe";"Sex in his chair."
"Ross";"What, uh... what were you thinking?"
"Rachel";"I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a historythere. 'S'like you and Carol."
"Ross";"No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!"
"Rachel";"Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, righthere, right now," what would you say?"
"Chandler";"If it helps, I could slide over."
"Ross";"It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples andoranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go."
"Phoebe";"Where are you going?"
"Ross";"(leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean Ihave things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keepingup with it. Okay?"
"Chandler";"Hello? Hello?"
"Rachel";"(on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes,yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh.(Listens) Okay.

"Chandler";"Hell is filled with people like you."
"Joey";"(entering) He's back! The peeper's back!"
"Joey";"(ducking) Get down!"
"Rachel";"Get down?"
"Chandler";"...And boogie!"
"Rachel";"Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy."
"Monica";"Relax. Y'know, she may not even know."
"Rachel";"Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me?I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camptogether... she taught me how to kiss.."
"Joey";"(intrigued) Yeah?"
"Rachel";"And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so.."
"Joey";"..Naughty!"
"Rachel";"Right, I'll see you guys later..."
"Joey";"Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you tokiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exitsand slams the door in his face.) That's fine, yeah..."
"Chandler";"Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?"
"Monica";"Why don't you just take it with you?"
"Chandler";"Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
"Monica";"Why don't you just call her?"
"Chandler";"I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride."
"Monica";"Do you?"
"Chandler";"No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine.Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, Iaccidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great.(Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonnacall me back. (He starts doing a little jig.) She's on the other line, she's gonna call meback, she's on the other line, gonna call me back..."
"Monica";"Don't you have to pee?"
"Chandler";"'S'why I'm dancing..."
"Rachel";"Mindy."
"Mindy";"Hey, you."
"Rachel";"Hey, you.... So, what's up?"
"Mindy";"Um.. we should really be sitting for this."
"Rachel";"Sure we should... So."
"Mindy";"Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friendin the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'causeshe's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a prettyface. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Mindy";"Will you be my maid of honour?"
"Rachel";"Of course!"
"Mindy";"Oh that's so great!"
"Rachel";"Was that all you wanted to ask me?"
"Mindy";"That's all!"
"Rachel";"Ohhhh!! (Mindy starts to sob.) ...What? What?"
"Mindy";"That's not all."
"Rachel";"Oh sure it is!"
"Mindy";"Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city."
"Rachel";"Um, what- what would make you think that?"
"Mindy";"Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting reallyweird, and then last night, he came home smelling like"
"Rachel";"(draws back) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when Iwas engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too."
"Mindy";"Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!"
"Rachel";"What? What's what you were afraid of?"
"Mindy";"Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had alittle thing on the side."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Mindy";"I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't doit, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid."
"Rachel";"Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid."
"Mindy";"What do you mean?"
"Rachel";"(offers her arm to Mindy and she sniffs) Smell familiar?"
"Mindy";"Oh no."
"Rachel";"Oh, I am so sorry."
"Mindy";"No me, I am so sorry..."
"Joey";"(watches them for a while) Oh my."
"Ross";"Four letters: "Circle or hoop"."
"Chandler";"Ring dammit, ring!"
"Ross";"Thanks."
"Joey";"(entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?"
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Joey";"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer."
"Chandler";"(investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!"
"Monica";"Just like you told her you did! (Chandler glares at her.) ... Justpointing out the irony."
"Joey";"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I gotthe peeper's name! Can I use the phone?"
"Chandler";"Nngghhh!!!!!!!"

"Joey";"Yeah. Yeah, so what? (On phone) Look, I live across the street, (walkingto the window) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciateit, okay? (Listens) Yeah, I can see you right now! (Listens) Hello! (Listens) If I wannawalk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feellike—(Listens)—Thank you, but... that's not really the point... (Listens) Thepoint is that... (Listens) Mostly free weights, but occasionally.."
"Monica";"Joey!!"
"Joey";"(on phone) Yeah, my neighbor... (Listens) Yeah, the brunette... (toMonica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress."
"Monica";"The green dress? Really?"
"Joey";"Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day."
"Monica";"(waves dismissively to Sidney) Nooo!"
"Rachel";"Hey. Got a second?"
"Barry";"Sure, sure. Come on... (Mindy enters) ...in..."
"Mindy";"Hello, sweetheart."
"Barry";"Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?"
"Rachel";"Uh, we are here to break up with you."
"Barry";"Both of you?"
"Mindy";"Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things shouldhappen to you."
"Barry";"I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, Icouldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!"
"Rachel";"Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?"
"Barry";"....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy."
"Rachel";"Even when we were having sex in that chair?"
"Barry";"(to Mindy) I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you."
"Rachel";"Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of alineup!"
"Mindy";"(to Rachel) You did it twice?"
"Rachel";"Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry."
"Mindy";"Okay..."
"Barry";"(to Mindy) Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'llstart all over again. We'll go back to Aruba."
"Bernice";"(over intercom) Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergencyhere...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer."
"Barry";"Oh God... (Into intercom) I'll be right there, Bernice. (to Mindy) Look,please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back."
"Rachel";"Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweatingwhen he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jumpright in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels"
"Mindy";"Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him."
"Rachel";"What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan ina smock!"
"Mindy";"Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, Istill really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S."
"Rachel";"Oh God."
"Mindy";"I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll stillbe my maid of honor...?"
"Rachel";"And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba."
"Monica";"You okay?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Monica";"Really?"
"Rachel";"Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I havewondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know."
"Monica";"Aww... (They hug)"
"Joey";"Big day."
"Joey";"All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he'sgot the monocle, he's got the top hat..."
"Phoebe";"You know he's gay?"
"Ross";"I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?"
"Chandler";"Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody."
"All";"Hi. Hi."
"Chandler";"What are you doing here?"
"Chandler";"...I'm, I'm okay."
"Chandler";"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever..."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"All";"Bye."
"Phoebe";"Whoo-hoo!"
"Monica";"Yeah, there you go!"
"Ross";"Second date!"
"Chandler";"...I dunno."
"Rachel";"You"
"Chandler";"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing abouther coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?"
"Joey";"How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?"
"Monica";"I have no idea. But look how much they spent!"
"Rachel";"Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you onlyhave to pay for the stuff that you bought."
"Monica";"I know. It's just such reckless spending."
"Ross";"I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of alreadythrown caution to the wind."
"Chandler";"Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop."
"Monica";"That's me."
"Phoebe";"Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! (Points to a lamp which isshaking behind the sofa)"
"Ross";"Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-(Marcel runs toward Rachel's room) come here, Marcel-"
"Rachel";"Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him."
"Monica";"Ross, you've got to do something about the humping."
"Ross";"What? It's, it's just a phase."
"Chandler";"Well, that's what we said about Joey..."
"Ross";"Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal."
"Rachel";"(Out of shot) Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!"
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious."
"Rachel";"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing."
"Monica";"This woman's living my life."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Monica";"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this,look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores thatI'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies."
"Rachel";"You're not an artist."
"Monica";"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all thisstuff. Only I don't."
"Rachel";"Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things."
"Monica";"Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we."
"Rachel";"(Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'..."
"Monica";"Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the NewSchool?"
"Rachel";"(Yawning) Nooo..."
"Monica";"This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have mymother."
"Chandler";"How about Joey... Pepponi?"
"Joey";"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's moreneutral."
"Chandler";"Joey... Switzerland?"
"Joey";"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound likeI'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not."
"Chandler";"Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?"
"Joey";"Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar."
"Chandler";"Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
"Joey";"(Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good."
"Chandler";"Might wanna try Joseph."
"Joey";"Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!"
"Chandler";"Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is theFiddler on the Roof."
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Phoebe";"Hey."
"Monica";"Hi. (On the phone) Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'mtaking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were."
"Phoebe";"What are you doing?"
"Monica";"(Hushes her) Alright, great. Thanks a lot. (Hangs up) I'm going to tapclass."
"Rachel";"What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your creditcard?"
"Monica";"This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is."
"Rachel";"Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica,y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like aweird obsession thing."
"Phoebe";"This is madness. It's madness, I tell you,"
"Monica";"What d'you think?"
"Phoebe";"Lotsa things."
"Rachel";"Which one do you think she is?"
"Teacher";"May I help you?"
"Monica";"Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe."
"Rachel";"What does she mean?"
"Monica";"Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?"
"Teacher";"(To the class) People! Last time there were some empty yoghurtcontainers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!"
"Rachel";"She could be you."
"Teacher";"Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight..."
"Monica";"Okay, I'm not getting this!"
"Phoebe";"(Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way) I'm totally getting it!"
"Monica";"Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievablyuncoordinated?"
"Rachel";"What? You just click when they click."
"Teacher";"Alright people, now everyone grab a partner."
"Phoebe";"Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel."
"Monica";"Great. It's gym class all over again."
"Rachel";"Rachel:"
"Teacher";"Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me."
"Monica";"Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare."
"Woman";"It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here Iam. Who's the new tense girl?"
"Teacher";"She's your partner."
"Woman";"Hi. I'm Monica."
"Monica";"Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana."
"Monica";"Yeah. It's Dutch."
"Fake Monica";"You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. (Asks hersomething in Dutch)"
"Monica";"Um, Pennsylvania Dutch."
"Teacher";"And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight..."
"Ross";"(Mortified) Hi."
"Joey";"Joey:"
"Joey";"Where've you been?"
"Ross";"At the vet."
"Chandler";"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
"Ross";"She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reachedsexual maturity."
"Joey";"(To Chandler) Hey! He beat ya."
"Ross";"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
"Chandler";"So what does this mean?"
"Ross";"I'm gonna have to give him up."
"Joey";"I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!"
"Chandler";"I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adultalready?"
"Ross";"I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before youknow it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg."
"Joey";"Isn't there any way you can keep him?"
"Ross";"No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access tosome... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo."
"Joey";"How do you get a monkey into a zoo?"
"Chandler";"I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a"
"Ross";"Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would beone of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just bea pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami,so that's a possibility."
"Chandler";"Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's atotal party zoo."
"Phoebe";"Hey. We found her, we found the girl."
"Chandler";"What?"
"Joey";"Did you call the cops?"
"Rachel";"Nope. We took her to lunch."
"Chandler";"Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice."
"Ross";"What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's astealer."
"Monica";"Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, youforget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazingspirit."
"Ross";"Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader."
"Chandler";"...Take off their hats!"
"Phoebe";"Popes in a"
"Rachel";"No way. No way did you do this."
"Fake Monica";"Monana was very brave."
"Monica";"It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen.Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!"
"Fake Monica";"So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short andhave breasts..."
"Monica";"...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!"
"Rachel";"Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. Iget to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. (Exits)"
"Fake Monica";"Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show."
"Monica";"'Scuse me?"
"Fake Monica";"There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, singMemories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?"
"Monica";"Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not likeyou. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class."
"Fake Monica";"Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background."
"Monica";"What?"
"Fake Monica";"Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?"
"Monica";"Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned."
"Fake Monica";"I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie thatchanged my life. Did you ever see"
"Monica";"Uh-huh."
"Fake Monica";"I thought that movie was so incredibly..."
"Monica";"Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend"
"Ross";"(Reading letters) Oh God. (To Marcel) We didn't get into Scranton. (To theothers) That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know whothis is harder on, me or him."
"Phoebe";"I'd say that chair's taking the brunt."
"Ross";"Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?"
"Rachel";"Oh, somebody will."
"Joey";"(entering) You know there already"
"Chandler";"You're kidding."
"Joey";"Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people.You'd think you would've known that!"
"Chandler";"Y'know, you'd think I would've."
"Joey";"Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?"
"Phoebe";"...Flame Boy."
"Ross";"Where exactly is your zoo?"
"Dr. Baldhara";"Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of aninteractive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?"
"Ross";"Yes."
"Dr. Baldhara";"Does he, uh, fight with other animals?"
"Ross";"No-no, he's, he's very docile."

"Ross";"Well I, I don't know. Why?"
"Dr. Baldhara";"Uh, how is he at handling small objects?"
"Ross";"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean..."
"Dr. Baldhara";"How about a hammer, or a small blade?"
"Ross";"Why- why- why would he need a blade?"
"Dr. Baldhara";"Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns,you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel."
"Joey";"Joey:"
"Joey";"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing..."
"Chandler";"...He's in."
"Ross";"He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!"
"Dr. Baldhara";"You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well andgood, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give youtwenty percent of the gains."
"Monica";"Yo- hooo!"
"Rachel";"Where the hell've you been?"
"Monica";"Monica and I just crashed an embassy party."

"Monica";"Well, not... worried, just... wondering."

"Monica";"Not necessarily..."
"Fake Monica";"Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amishthing."
"Monica";"Um, I'm not actually Amish."
"Fake Monica";"Really? Then why are you like that?"
"Teacher";"You by the door. In or out?"
"Monica";"In. (She joins in the dancing. She still flounders)"
"Teacher";"You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!"
"Monica";"Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!"

"Joey";"Marcel, I'm hungry."
"Ross";"That was good."
"Rachel";"(Brings Marcel a teddy bear) Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just,y'know, something to, um, do on the plane."
"Ross";"Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him."
"Ross";"Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sitsbeside him) Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm reallygonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet tome, you've been more like a be- (Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) Okay,Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for twoseconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him."
"Joey";"Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio."
"Monica";"Tell him."
"Rachel";"No."
"Phoebe";"Tell him, tell him."
"Monica";"Just...please tell him."
"Rachel";"Shut up!"
"Chandler";"Tell me what?"
"Monica";"Look at you, you won't even look at him."
"Chandler";"(sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason whywomen won't look at me."
"Rachel";"All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, youand I, were..."
"Phoebe";"Doing it on this table. (points at the table)"
"Chandler";"Wow!"
"Joey";"Exellent dream score."
"Ross";"Why, why, why would you dream that?"
"Chandler";"More importantly, was I any good?"
"Rachel";"Well, you were pretty damn good."
"Chandler";"Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.(Monica pats him on his lap)"
"Rachel";"Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table."
"Ross";"I love it, when we share."
"Chandler";"You're okay there?"
"Ross";"I can't belive you two had sex in her dream."
"Chandler";"I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i wassomebody else's subconscious."
"Chandler";"Hello Rachel."
"Rachel";"Get off."
"Phoebe";"(points at Joey's pen) Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drillpress?"
"Joey";"I don't know. What are you wearing?"
"Ross";"Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?"
"Phoebe";"Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of mymassage clients."
"Chandler";"Pirates again?"
"Phoebe";"No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this"massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are."
"Joey";"Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you."
"Chandler";"(sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea."
"Phoebe";"What... I could, I could do it. What is it?"
"Chandler";"Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She ishaving one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story."
"Phoebe";"I could be a secretary."
"Chandler";"Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, becauseit involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day."
"Phoebe";"I could do that."
"Rachel";"What are you playing with?"
"Ross";"Oh, it's my new beeper."
"Joey";"What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?"
"Monica";"Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're stillextinct.'"
"Ross";"No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. Imean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO."
"Chandler";"A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid."
"Monica";"All right, I'll see you guys later. (raises)"
"Rachel";"Off to see young Ethan?"
"Monica";"Thank you."
"Joey";"How young is young Ethan? Young?"
"Monica";"He's... our age."
"Chandler";"When we were?"
"Monica";"Okay, he's a senior in college."
"Ross";"College?"
"Chandler";"Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?"
"Monica";"No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22."
"Monica";"Oh, I can't pass for 22?"
"Phoebe";"Well, maybe 25-26."
"Monica";"I am 26."
"Phoebe";"There you go."
"Chandler";"Can you hear that?"
"Phoebe";"(plays with a thumbtack remover) Yeah?"
"Chandler";"See that'll stop when you pick up the phone."
"Phoebe";"Oh. Uh, I'm on. (picks up the phone)"
"Phoebe";"(with a deep voice) Mr. Bing's office. (Listens) No I'm sorry, he's in ameeting right now."
"Chandler";"I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops."
"Phoebe";"Will he know what this is in reference to? (Listens) And he has yournumber? (Listens) All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye."

"Monica";"What?"
"Rachel";"Could tonight be the Night?"
"Monica";"I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... youknow. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things."
"Rachel";"So, did you shave your legs?"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"A-ha!"
"Joey";"Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean..."
"Ross";"Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time."
"Joey";"All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool."
"Ross";"(on phone) Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. (pause) No, Andr� is not here.(to Joey) Third time today. (on phone) Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform thosekind of services."

"Joey";"Hey, hey. How was the first day?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice."
"Chandler";"See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonderwhat he means) Me."
"Phoebe";"No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you."
"Chandler";"Why not?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, because, you know... they don't like you."
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"I thought you knew that."
"Chandler";"Noho. Who doesn't they like me?"
"Phoebe";"Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone."
"Chandler";"What are you talking about?"
"Phoebe";"Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you gotpromoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr.Bing, "Boss Man Bing"."
"Chandler";"I can't belive it."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, yeah. They even do you."
"Chandler";"They do me?"
"Phoebe";"You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report"
"Chandler";"I don't sound like that."

"Ross";"'The hills were alive with the sound"
"Joey";"(reaches for hi scones) My scones."
"Ross";"Ross:"
"Chandler";"Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so"
"Chandler";"That is so"
"Monica";"Did not."
"Young Ethan";"I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought thatgunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen."
"Monica";"How was that possible?"
"Young Ethan";"Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being heldup, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking:why does people continue to go there? (He checks his watch.) Oh, ah. I should go."
"Monica";"Okay."
"Young Ethan";"Okay."
"Monica";"Unless..."
"Young Ethan";"What?"
"Monica";"Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so..."
"Young Ethan";"Yeah, I'd really like that."
"Young Ethan";"Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is somethingyou should know."
"Monica";"Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretlymarried to a goat?'"
"Young Ethan";"Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technicalsense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh..."
"Monica";"Ethan?"
"Young Ethan";"Yeah?"
"Monica";"Are you a virgin?"
"Young Ethan";"Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes Iam. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person."
"Monica";"Really?"
"Young Ethan";"Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?"
"Young Ethan";"Wow!"
"Monica";"You keep saying that."
"Young Ethan";"You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even whenyou practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that."
"Monica";"Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. AndI, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to."
"Young Ethan";"Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong."
"Monica";"No-no. Nothing wrong about that."
"Young Ethan";"Oh."
"Monica";"Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months."
"Young Ethan";"Huh!"
"Monica";"But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, whatthe hell does it matter how old we are."
"Young Ethan";"Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have anotherone for you. I'm a little younger than I said."
"Monica";"You're not a senior?"
"Young Ethan";"Oh, I'm a senior... in High School."
"Monica";"Ok...ay."
"Monica";"What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn'talive during the Bicentennial."
"Young Ethan";"I just had sex."
"Monica";"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?"
"Young Ethan";"Well, you never told me how old you were."
"Monica";"Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48states. What were you thinking?"
"Young Ethan";"I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'..."
"Monica";"Don't say it. (closes Ethan's mouth with her hand)"
"Young Ethan";"...in love with you."
"Monica";"Really?"
"Young Ethan";"(nods) Sorry."
"Monica";"Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a schoolnight. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'mJoan Collins."
"Young Ethan";"Who?"
"Ross";"(on phone) Okay, Andr� should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie,bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way."
"Chandler";"Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream."
"Rachel";"No, forget it."
"Chandler";"Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?"
"Rachel";"All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades toRoss, who's listening very carefully) Joey was there too."
"Joey";"All right. (Moves closer.)"
"Ross";"Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there."
"Rachel";"No."
"Ross";"You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?"
"Rachel";"No, it was just the three of us."
"Ross";"Huh!"
"Joey";"So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you andme and Chandler?"
"Rachel";"(laughs) You know what?"
"Joey";"What?"
"Rachel";"There were times when it wasn't even me."
"Phoebe";"That is so sweet, you guys. (hugs them)"
"Rachel";"Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?"
"Monica";"What?"
"Rachel";"Ethan called again."
"Monica";"Oh."
"Ross";"Are you not seeing him anymore?"
"Monica";"No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out."
"Chandler";"And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to getout of gym."
"Rachel";"I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. Hestopped by."
"Joey";"Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one thestrongest"

"Ross";"It's morphin time!"
"Joey";"Stegosaurus!"
"Chandler";"Tyrannosaurus!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. (raises) Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and thenI have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) Cool!"
"Rachel";"Where are you going?"
"Phoebe";"Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people."
"Chandler";"Work people? Nobody told me."
"Phoebe";"No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know,them-not-liking-you-extravaganza."
"Chandler";"You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends.You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person."
"Phoebe";"Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them.Let them see what a great guy you still are."
"Chandler";"You think I should?"
"Phoebe";"I really do, yeah."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Phoebe";"Okay."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Phoebe";"Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek thatinvited the boss."
"Chandler";"I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and Idoing"
"Phoebe";"You were great. But they still made fun of you."
"Chandler";"What?"
"Phoebe";"You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. CaringBoss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., Iwanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!""
"Chandler";"Then, I don't get it."
"Phoebe";"Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like,the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them...They still say you're a great boss."
"Chandler";"They do?"
"Phoebe";"Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore."

"Phoebe";"No, but you can't."
"Chandler";"But I just wa..."
"Phoebe";"Uh uh."

"Ross";"Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she'shaving a baby, otherwise I just ignore it."
"Joey";"What about Andr�?"
"Ross";"Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousinNathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know."
"Young Ethan";"Hey."
"Monica";"That was gonna be my opener."
"Rachel";"(understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone) Hey, did you guyscheck out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?"
"Ross";"I thought that was just a rumour."
"Rachel";"True story."
"Joey";"They're here already?"
"Young Ethan";"All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I onlysaid so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I havea job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We cantalk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but Ithought that was great."
"Monica";"It was."
"Young Ethan";"Then, what's the problem?"
"Monica";"Ethan, it's um... it's icky."
"Young Ethan";"Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?"
"Monica";"This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If youwere a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times,I would really..."
"Young Ethan";"No, don't say it. (closes Monica's mouth with his hand)"
"Monica";"...love you."

"Lydia";"The Celtics."
"Joey";"The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?"

"Phoebe";"Ok."
"Phoebe";"Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute."
"Monica";"No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?"
"Chandler";"You'll get one."
"Monica";"Oh yeah? When?"
"Chandler";"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us aremarried, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
"Monica";"Why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
"Chandler";"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
"Monica";"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
"Chandler";"No, no, no."
"Monica";"What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?"
"Chandler";"(trapped) Uh, uh."
"Monica";"Well?"
"Chandler";"Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the backof the chair he was sitting in)"
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Phoebe";"Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress."
"Monica";"Did you go home and change?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr.Franzblau been by?"
"Monica";"No, I haven't seen him."
"Rachel";"Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. (Pause) What if the babyneeds him?"
"Chandler";"Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, yourfather a doctor?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, why?"
"Chandler";"No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)"
"Lydia";"Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if itis his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. (pause) What do you mean,Joey who? (covers the phone, to Joey) Joey who?"
"Joey";"Tribbiani."
"Lydia";"Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. (to Joey) She wants to talk to you.Take the phone."
"Joey";"(takes phone) Hi, yeah, it's me. (Listens) Oh, no no no, we're justfriends. (Listens) Yeah, I'm single. (Listens) 25. (Listens) An actor. (Listens) Hello?"
"Lydia";"She's not much of a phone person."
"Joey";"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, ifsomeone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?"
"Lydia";"Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no."
"Joey";"Ok, look, maybe I should just go."
"Lydia";"Maybe you should."
"Joey";"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?"
"Joey";"You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team."
"Lydia";"Oh, that is so not true."
"Joey";"Oh, it is."
"Lydia";"It isn't."
"Joey";"It is."
"Lydia";"Isn't!"
"Ross";"Breathe."
"Susan";"Breathe."
"Ross";"Breathe."
"Susan";"Breathe."
"Ross";"Breathe."
"Susan";"Breathe."
"Carol";"You're gonna kill me!"
"Ross";"15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12..."
"Carol";"Count faster."
"Susan";"It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keepfocusing on Jordie."
"Ross";"Who the hell is Jordie?"
"Susan";"Your son."
"Ross";"No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name isJamie."
"Carol";"Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back toJordie."
"Ross";"What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,"
"Carol";"Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp."
"Ross";"I got it."
"Susan";"I got it."
"Ross";"I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps."
"Susan";"No, you don't."
"Carol";"All right, that's it. I want both of you out."
"Ross";"Why?"
"Susan";"He started it!"
"Ross";"No, you started it."
"Susan";"You did!"
"Carol";"I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you'renot making it any easier."
"Ross";"But..."
"Carol";"Now go!"
"Ross";"(to Susan) Thanks a lot."
"Susan";"(to Ross) See what you did."
"Ross";"(to Carol) Yeah, listen..."
"Nurse";"Breathe, breathe, breathe..."
"Lydia";"Oh, no."
"Joey";"Ew! What is that? Something exploded!"
"Nurse";"It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?"
"Joey";"(panicked) Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?"
"Nurse";"(to Joey) Breathe, breathe, breathe."
"Ross";"Please. This is so your fault."
"Susan";"How, how is this my fault?"
"Ross";"Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along."
"Susan";"Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along."
"Ross";"You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?"
"Susan";"You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me."
"Ross";"Oh, I'm threatened by you?"
"Susan";"Yes."
"Phoebe";"Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, youguys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very buildingand your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So juststop all the yelling, just stop it!"
"Ross";"Yeah, Susan."
"Phoebe";"Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this."
"Phoebe";"Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?"
"All";"Help!"
"Ross";"I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. (Walks backwards as ifhe is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls) Ow."
"Carol";"Are they here yet?"
"Rachel";"No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to findthem, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?"
"Carol";"Ok."
"Rachel";"Ok?"
"Carol";"Ok."
"Rachel";"(to Dr. Franzblau) Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, itsounds fascinating."
"Dr. Franzblau";"It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right bymy hotel. (Carol sits up in pain, Rachel and Dr. Franzblau casually lay her back down)There you go, dear."
"Joey";"Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder,harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey,hey, ho, ho. Let's— (notices the nurse looking at him strangely) I wasjust—yeah, right. Push! Push!"
"Susan";"What're you gonna do, suck the door open?"
"Ross";"Help! Help!"
"Phoebe";"(singing)"
"Susan and Ross";"(even louder) Help!"
"Monica";"Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. (Listens) Yeah, Ross isgreat. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. (Listens) No, he's gone. (Listens) No no, youdon't have to fly back, really. (Listens) What do you mean this might be your only chance?(Listens) Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet."
"Chandler";"Where have you been?"
"Joey";"Oh, just had a baby."
"Chandler";"Mazel tov!"
"Dr. Franzblau";"I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she'sdoing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?"
"Rachel";"(anxiously) No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?"
"Dr. Franzblau";"No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me."
"Rachel";"Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors."
"Dr. Franzblau";"No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, youknow, where I do."
"Rachel";"Oh."
"Dr. Franzblau";"I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard,when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?"
"Rachel";"I'm a waitress."
"Dr. Franzblau";"Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at theend of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'..."
"Rachel";"(getting the point) Yeah. Gotcha."
"Dr. Franzblau";"I'm gonna go check up on your friend."
"Rachel";"Ok. That's fine. (takes her earrings out)"
"Lydia";"So how did you know I was even here?"
"Guy";"Your mom called me. So is this her?"
"Lydia";"No, this is a loaner."
"Guy";"I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself."
"Lydia";"I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. (Joeysmiles) So, did you see who won the game?"
"Guy";"Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck."
"Lydia";"Yeah, they're not so bad."
"Ross";"Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to Susan) This is allyour fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son isbeing born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
"Susan";"The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this justas much as you have."
"Ross";"No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have,ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home withthe baby, ok? Where does that leave me?"
"Susan";"You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I?There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day."
"Ross";"Every day is Lesbian Lover Day."
"Phoebe";"This is so great."
"Ross";"You wanna explain that?"
"Phoebe";"I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and mymother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents tomake one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who careabout it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's noteven born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I'msorry, you were fighting."
"Carol";"Where are they?"
"Monica";"I'm sure they'll be here soon."
"Rachel";"Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
"Joey";"Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station."
"Chandler";"(to Joey) You are really frightening me."
"Chandler";"Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull herhand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?"
"Dr. Franzblau";"All right, ten centimeters, here we go."
"Nurse";"All right, honey, time to start pushing."
"Carol";"But they're not here yet!"
"Dr. Franzblau";"I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them."
"Carol";"Oh, god."
"Ross";"Ok, got the vent open."
"Phoebe";"(reading the nametag on the uniform) Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital workerBen. It's Ben... to the rescue!"
"Ross";"Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two,three. Ok, That's it, Ben."
"Susan";"What do you see?"
"Phoebe";"Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is infact a dark vent."
"Ross";"Phoebs, It's open! It's open!"
"Janitor";"(to Ross and Susan) Wait! You forgot your legs!"
"All";"Push, push!"
"Ross";"We're here!"
"Carol";"(irked) Where have you been?"
"Ross";"Long story, honey."
"Dr. Franzblau";"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. Ineed—(reaches for an instrument, Rachel's hand is on it) Excuse me, could I havethis?"
"Nurse";"All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, andthere's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian lifepartner, out you go!"
"All";"Good luck!"
"Chandler";"(to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian lifepartner?"
"Nurse";"Out!"
"Dr. Franzblau";"All right, he's crowning. Here he comes."
"Ross";"Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge.Carol, how are you doing this?"
"Carol";"(straining) Not.... helping!"
"Dr. Franzblau";"You're doing great, you're doing fine."
"Ross";"(puts his head near the baby) Hello! (to Dr. Franzblau) Oh, sorry."
"Susan";"What do you see? What do you see?"
"Ross";"We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at thelittle fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right!Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person."
"Susan";"Oh, look at that."
"Carol";"What does he look like?"
"Ross";"Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in"
"Carol";"Really?"
"Phoebe";"(from the air vent overhead) You guys, he's beautiful!"
"Ross";"Oh, thanks, Pheebs!"
"Susan";"No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy."
"Ross";"(thinking) How 'bout Ben?"
"Susan";"I like Ben."
"Carol";"Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?"
"Ross";"We uh, we just cooked it up."
"Susan";"That's what we were off doing."
"Monica";"Hi."
"Ross";"Hey."
"Monica";"Can we come in?"
"Ross";"(to Ben) I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet.Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody."
"Phoebe";"Susan, he looks just like you."
"Susan";"Thanks."
"Rachel";"Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these."
"Chandler";"I know, I still am one of these."
"Monica";"Ross, can I?"
"Ross";"The head, the head. You gotta..."
"Monica";"(getting choked up) Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'myour Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum."
"Ross";"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not bearound, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this.(returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I'll stillalways come back, like this. (returns)"
"Chandler";"And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.(Does a baseball sign.)"
"Monica";"He is so amazing."
"Rachel";"Oh, I know. Look at him."
"Joey";"Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name."
"Phoebe";"Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) Look, he'sopening his eyes. (picture comes back)"
"Joey";"He doesn't do much, does he?"
"Ross";"No, this is pretty much it."
"Rachel";"You guys wanna get some coffee?"
"All";"Yeah."
"Ross";"All right, I'll see you guys later."
"Phoebe";"Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again."
"Ross";"And here's little Ben nodding off..."
"Monica";"Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!"
"Rachel";"Oh, let me see! (grabs picture) Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing?You must just want to kiss him all over!"
"Ross";"(quietly) That would be nice."
"Rachel";"Pardon?"
"Chandler";"Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walksover to where Joey is seated)"
"Joey";"Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back."
"Chandler";"Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now oweme... 17 jillion dollars."
"Joey";"I will, really. I'll pay you back this time."
"Chandler";"(sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)"
"Joey";"Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some...research."
"Ross";"(overhearing) What kind of research?"
"Joey";"Oh, just, y'know.... science."
"Ross";"Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. (everyone's interest is piqued,they all look over)"
"Joey";"(sigh)... It's a fertility study."
"Monica";"Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your"
"Joey";"Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, Ijust go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey,but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars."
"Ross";"Hey."

"Monica";"OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns..."
"Phoebe";"We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...(hands meat to Monica)"

"Monica";"Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late."
"Joey";"Oh, OK."
"Phoebe";"So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your(provocatively) special someone?"
"Joey";"I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great."
"Monica";"Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?"
"Joey";"What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?"
"Monica";"Man's got a point."
"Joey";"Well, the tough thing is, she"
"Chandler";"Crazy bitch."
"Joey";"Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according tothe rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonalexperiments, if you know what I mean."
"Monica";"Joey... we"
"Phoebe";"Hey."
"Monica";"Hey."
"Ross";"Hey. (Phoebe sees his bags)"
"Phoebe";"How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?"
"Ross";"I'm going to China."
"Phoebe";"Jeez, you say one thing, and..."
"Monica";"You're going to China?"
"Ross";"Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, butthey don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them togive us the bo—it's—it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone forlike, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's myitinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it toMonica)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)"
"Ross";"(to Monica): Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show itto Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picturedown, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun."
"Ross";"Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before Ileft."
"Monica";"Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl."
"Ross";"Oh. (pause) Hey, who's Carl?"
"Monica";"You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse."
"Ross";"No."
"Phoebe";"Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the..."
"Ross";"At the coffeehouse, right."
"Phoebe";"So you"
"Ross";"OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys."
"Phoebe";"Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story."
"Ross";"Hi."
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Ross";"(sigh)....I have to go to China."
"Joey";"The country?"
"Ross";"No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys knowwho Carl is?"
"Chandler";"Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no."
"Ross";"Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight."
"Joey";"Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?"
"Joey";"He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food."
"Chandler";"Course there, they just call it food."
"Ross";"Yeah... I guess. I don't—I don't know. Alright, just... just give herthis for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)"
"Joey";"Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you."
"Ross";"I know."
"Joey";"We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but...I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)"
"Chandler";"I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice."
"Melanie";"Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basketbusiness. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'"
"Joey";"Like the three musketeers, only with fruit."
"Chandler";"(sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)"
"Monica";"(gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?"
"Rachel";"Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)"
"Monica";"Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?"
"Joey";"Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we'regonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I..."
"Joey";"Then you do. Heh, heh."
"Monica";"So, uh, have you ever thought about being there"
"Joey";"What do you mean?"
"Monica";"Y'know, just be there"
"Joey";"Not following you."
"Monica";"Think about it."
"Rachel";"OK, I'm guessing this is from..."
"Rachel";"Well, thank you, Melanie."
"Chandler";"(pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me."
"Rachel";"(picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles...it's... (opens it)"
"Rachel";"This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feelslike a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!"
"Joey";"(to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times."
"Melanie";"There is a little child inside this man!"
"Chandler";"Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die."
"Rachel";"Who's this from?"
"Chandler";"Oh, that's Ross's."
"Rachel";"Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered."
"Phoebe";"Remembered what?"
"Rachel";"It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I sawthis pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I wasa little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!"
"Chandler";"Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his"
"Phoebe";"Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune."
"Monica";"I can't believe he did this."
"Chandler";"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love withCarol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
"Rachel";"What did you just say?"
"Chandler";"(panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck."
"Rachel";"No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?"
"Chandler";"(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin...."
"Rachel";"Oh.... my God."
"Chandler";"(rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no...."
"Joey";"(pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head.That'll turn back time."
"Rachel";"I mean, this is unbelievable."
"Phoebe";"I know. This is really, really huge."
"Chandler";"No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee."
"Phoebe";"Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same everagain."
"Chandler";"OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
"Monica";"I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?"
"Rachel";"No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned somethingabout asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what elsedid he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?"
"Joey";"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn'tmind getting a cup of coffee or something."
"Rachel";"Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)"
"Chandler";"(quickly) H-He's in China!"
"Joey";"The country."
"Monica";"No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave foranother forty-five more minutes."
"Chandler";"What about the time difference?"
"Monica";"From here to the airport?"
"Chandler";"Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!"
"Monica";"Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?"
"Rachel";"I-I-I don't know."
"Chandler";"Well then maybe you shouldn't go."
"Joey";"He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's thekind of thing that can wait."
"Monica";"Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now."
"Rachel";"I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him."
"Phoebe";"Here, look, alright, does this help?"
"Rachel";"Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him.I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta...OK, I'll see you later. (opens door)"
"Chandler";"Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)"
"Ross";"(something in Chinese)"
"Ross";"Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)"
"Rachel";"Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...."
"Rachel";"Hi."
"Flight Attendant";"May I see your boarding pass?"
"Rachel";"Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend."
"Flight Attendant";"Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unlessyou have a boarding pass."
"Rachel";"No, I know, but I—he just went on. He's right there, he's got theblue jacket on, I... can I j-just..."
"Flight Attendant";"No no no! Federal regulations!"
"Rachel";"OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him amessage for me? Please? This is"
"Flight Attendant";"Alright. What's the message?"
"Rachel";"Uh... I don't know."
"Flight Attendant";"Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you."
"Man";"(confused) What?"
"Flight Attendant";"It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and shewill see you when you get back."
"Man";"(to wife): Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talkingabout! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze."
"Melanie";"Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for aminute!"
"Joey";"Heh, heh. It was nothin'."
"Melanie";"Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! (she starts kissinghis chest)"
"Joey";"(panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's giveyou another turn."
"Melanie";"(surprised) M-Me again?"
"Joey";"Sure! Why not?"
"Melanie";"Boy, somebody's gonna get a"
"Melanie";"Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be."
"Joey";"How do you mean?"
"Melanie";"I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guyswho're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man Iever met. I mean... you're practically a woman."
"Monica";"Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean,it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throwit out?"
"Rachel";"I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, andI thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's"
"Rachel";"I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'mthinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great."
"Monica";"Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what thebest part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it'slike starting on the fifteenth date!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenthdate."
"Monica";"Another good point."
"Phoebe";"No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you'realready in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed."
"Rachel";"(confused) Huh?"
"Phoebe";"Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?"
"Monica";"Why isn't it working out?"
"Rachel";"I don't know... sometimes it doesn't."
"Monica";"Is he not cute enough for you?"
"Rachel";"No!"
"Monica";"Does he not make enough money?"
"Rachel";"No, I'm just...."
"Phoebe";"Maybe there's someone else."
"Rachel";"Wha..."
"Monica";"Is there? Is there someone else?"
"Rachel";"No! There is.. there is noone else!"
"Monica";"Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?"
"Chandler";"Hey, big..."
"Joey";"Shhhh!"
"Chandler";"(quietly) ...spender."
"Joey";"She's still asleep."
"Chandler";"So how'd it go?"
"Joey";"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?"
"Chandler";"The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you knowme."
"Joey";"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes megreat. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it waslike a ticker tape parade!"
"Chandler";"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the paraderoute."
"Joey";"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, allof a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I wasable to appreciate it on another level."
"Chandler";"I didn't know you had another level."
"Joey";"I know! Neither did I!"
"Monica";"Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Monica";"Oh, from who?"
"Rachel";"From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me."
"Monica";"Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couplehours? At gate 27-B?"
"Rachel";"Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it andI've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea."
"Monica";"Oh, why?"
"Rachel";"Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would begoing out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don'twanna..."
"Monica";"(gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!"
"Rachel";"Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so..."
"Monica";"I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll begood. I promise."
"Rachel";"Who is it?"
"Intercom";"It's me, Carl."
"Rachel";"C'mon up."
"Monica";"Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kindof crazy thing you won't be hearing from me."
"Joey";"Seven hundred bucks!"
"Chandler";"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?"
"Joey";"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like Ilearned something."
"Chandler";"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
"Joey";"What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walkaround like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)"
"Carl";"I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that"
"Ross";"I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me."
"Rachel";"Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here."
"Ross";"Fine, just stop thinking about me."
"Ross";"Can't do it, can you?"
"Rachel";"So I'm thinking about you. So what?"
"Ross";"I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?"
"Rachel";"Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy...."
"Carl";"I mean, come on, buddy, get a"
"Ross";"Rachel, come on. Give us a chance."
"Rachel";"Ross, it's too hard."
"Ross";"No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who caresabout them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninthgrade."
"Rachel";"Ross, you're like my best friend."
"Ross";"I know."
"Rachel";"If we broke up, and I lost you..."
"Ross";"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?"
"Rachel";"Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?"
"Ross";"(pause) No. But... it only has to happen"
"Rachel";"I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before."
"Ross";"Well, start looking."
"Rachel";"Wow."
"Carl";"Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind thishammerhead in traffic!"
"Rachel";"Right! You're right!"
"Carl";"Heh... y'know?"
"Rachel";"You know what?"
"Carl";"What?"
"Rachel";"I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am sosorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him herdrink) I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry."
"Carl";"But..."
"Rachel";"(sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me,sorry. Hi."
"Man";"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!"
"Ross";"Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
"Julie";"Oh, thanks, sweetie."
"Ross";"No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends."
"Julie";"Really?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Julie";"You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?"
"Ross";"No, no, they will. I just... uh..."
"Julie";"Can't wait."
"Ross";"Come on, they're gonna love you."
"Phoebe";"Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love withRachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind ofgot in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget abouther" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was inlove with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meethim when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the planewith another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enoughabout us. So, how've you been?"
"Rachel";"Oh my god. Oh my god. (She decides to make a break for it.) Excuse me.Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! (She tries climbing over a bench and falls down.)"
"Ross";"(seeing her) Rach!"
"Rachel";"Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? (Hits him withthe flowers.)"
"Ross";"It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Ross";"You're bleeding."
"Rachel";"I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr.Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything. (Looks at Julie)"
"Ross";"Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel."
"Rachel";"These are, these aren't for you. (to Julie) These are for you. (Loudly,thinking she can't speak English.) Welcome to our country."
"Julie";"(Loudly, proving she can speak English.) Thank you. I'm from New York."
"Rachel";"Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok.Baggage claim? Ok."
"Chandler";"No way!"
"Monica";"I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it withRoss!"
"Phoebe";"Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, allright, what's bigger than huge?"
"Joey";"Um, this?"
"Phoebe";"Yes."
"Monica";"Guys, you got your hair cut."
"Chandler";"Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay."
"Phoebe";"'Cause, you know, (in that voice) if you don't look good, we don't lookgood. I love that voice."
"Rachel";"(entering, out of breath) Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, armaround her. Cramp, cramp."
"Chandler";"Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs."
"Rachel";"(to Chandler) You, you, you said he liked me. (Ross and Julie enter)You, you slowpokes!"
"Ross";"That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is mysister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey, what up?"
"Joey";"What up?!"
"Ross";"Everyone, this is Julie."
"Rachel";"(out of breath) Julie."
"All";"Ohh. (Happily) Hi!"
"Julie";"Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better firstimpression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me."
"Ross";"And bus."
"Julie";"Oh my god."
"Ross";"The screaming guy?"
"Julie";"And the spitting?"
"Ross";"You gotta hear this story."
"Julie";"We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old..."
"Ross";"200 at least."
"Julie";"...and this guy..."
"Rachel";"And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave awaythe ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all Ican think about."
"Monica";"This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?"
"Julie";"Well, Ross and I were in grad school together."
"Ross";"But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guesswho's in charge of the dig."
"Rachel";"Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that justkick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
"Monica";"(to Julie) It's an expression."
"Ross";"Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see thebaby."
"Julie";"And then we've gotta get some sleep."
"Ross";"Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time."
"Chandler";"Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I liketo be surprised."
"Rachel";"Bye. (She closes the door and everyone tries to sympathize with her.)"
"Ross";"Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, sure."
"Ross";"Thank you."
"Chandler";"Hey, Rach, can I get..."
"Rachel";"Did you talk to him?"
"Chandler";"Not yet."
"Rachel";"Then, no."
"Chandler";"So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we leftyou, you were totally in love with, you know."
"Ross";"I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside thatkept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?"
"Chandler";"God?"
"Ross";"It was you, pal."
"Chandler";"Well, maybe it was God, doing me."
"Ross";"Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. Butthen I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I neverwould've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you."
"Chandler";"Well, you owe me one, big guy."
"Rachel";"(To Ross) Here's your lemonade."
"Ross";"I didn't order lemonade."
"Rachel";"Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna chargeyou for that."
"Ross";"But..."
"Rachel";"Go-go-go-go, come on! (Ross goes over to the counte) (to Chandler) Souh, what did you find out?"
"Chandler";"He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'msorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all byhimself!  Without any outside help whatsoever."
"Rachel";"How is that the silver lining?"
"Chandler";"You have to really wanna see it."
"Ross";"Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym."
"Monica";"Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering ifthey've changed it?"
"Monica";"No, although now that's what I'm thinking."
"Phoebe";"All right, so what were you thinking?"
"Monica";"Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, Ithought, maybe you'd like to do mine?"
"Phoebe";"Ohh! No."
"Monica";"Why not?"
"Phoebe";"Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable controlfreak."
"Monica";"No you're not."
"Phoebe";"I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings."
"Joey";"(answering the phone) Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it'sJulie, for you. (Throws him the phone.)"
"Ross";"(on phone) Hello? Hi."
"Chandler";"(entering) Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?"
"Joey";"Needs some clothes altered?"
"Chandler";"No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk."
"Joey";"Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. Hedid my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) Allright, when was 1990?"
"Chandler";"Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!"
"Ross";"(on phone) Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? (Sitsdown next to Rachel) Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two,three. (Doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet) Well you didn't hang upeither."
"Rachel";"She didn't hang up either!"
"Ross";"Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y..."
"Rachel";"(taking the phone and hanging it up) Sorry, I thought you were talkingto me."
"Ross";"Rachel! I'll just call her back."
"Rachel";"Okay!"
"Ross";"(calls Julie back) Hi?  Sorry, we got disconnected... (Walks away.)"
"Rachel";"(to Monica) Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happento me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he'sRrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have."
"Monica";"Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too."
"Rachel";"I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal withit. (Ross comes by, smoching with Julie on the phone.) I gotta get out of here. (Exits)"
"Chandler";"Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her."
"Joey";"(to Chandler) You know, I think I was sixteen."
"Monica";"(to Phoebe) Please, just a little bit off the back."
"Phoebe";"I'm still on "no.""
"Rachel";"(poking her head in from her bedroom) Uh, morning. Do you guys think youcould close your eyes for just a sec?"
"Joey";"No-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I'm not fallin' for that again."
"Phoebe";"What's goin' on?"
"Rachel";"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night."
"Chandler";"What stupid thing did you do?"
"Phoebe";"Ewww! (Gets up and walks away.)"
"Rachel";"Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on yourway, ok, bye-bye. (Paulo goes into his room.)"
"Monica";"Rachel, how did this happen?"
"Rachel";"I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night."
"Phoebe";"Where?"
"Rachel";"At his apartment. Is this juice?"
"Joey";"Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?"
"Rachel";"Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser."
"Monica";"Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad."
"Chandler";"People do stupid things when they're upset."
"Monica";"My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...(Everyonelooks at her), but this is about your horrible mistake."
"Ross";"Hi. Sorry we're late but we were—well, there was touching."
"Ross";"Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?"
"Ross";"(to Rachel) So, uh, he's back."
"Rachel";"Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?"
"Ross";"No, not a problem."
"Rachel";"Good! I'm glad it's not a problem."
"Phoebe";"(to Paulo) Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass."
"Chandler";"Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've gotpants that need to be altered."
"Joey";"Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.He'll know what it means."
"Chandler";"Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?"
"Monica";"(to Phoebe) You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hairwas so much shorter and cuter."
"Phoebe";"All right. Ok, but, but!  You have to promise that you will not beall like control-y and bossy and Monica about it."
"Monica";"I promise."
"Phoebe";"All right. (Talking to Monica's hair.) Now some of you are gonna getcut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing."
"Phoebe";"All right, that's it, I quit."
"Monica";"What? I didn't say anything."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but this (makes Monica's face) isn't the face of a person whotrusts a person. Ok, this (makes Monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know,doesn't trust a person."
"Monica";"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what wehad discussed."
"Phoebe";"Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it."
"Monica";"How who wears it?"
"Phoebe";"Demi Moore."
"Monica";"Demi Moore is not a he."
"Phoebe";"Well, he was a he in"
"Monica";"That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore."
"Phoebe";"Oh.  Oh!"
"Monica";"Oh my God!"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?"
"Monica";"She's the act"
"Phoebe";"Oh, she's got gorgeous hair."
"Chandler";"At least as long as I have the pants."
"Rachel";"How is she?"
"Phoebe";"It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign."
"Ross";"How's the hair?"
"Phoebe";"I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip onone side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
"Joey";"Can we see her?"
"Phoebe";"Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don'tyou come on in."
"Joey";"How're you doing?"
"Rachel";"I'm okay."
"Joey";"Ooh, that bad, huh?"
"Rachel";"When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rockbottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me."
"Joey";"You gotta tell Ross how you feel."
"Rachel";"Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?"
"Joey";"What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has beenin love with you for like 10 years."
"Rachel";"I don't know, I don't know."
"Joey";"Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've beenwith like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone theway Ross felt about you."
"Chandler";"(entering, angry) Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause)Your tailor is a very bad man!"
"Joey";"Frankie? What're you talking about?"
"Ross";"(entering from the bedroom) Hey, what's goin' on? (Pats Chandler on theshoulder which causes him to jump.)"
"Chandler";"Joey's tailor...took advantage of me."
"Ross";"What?"
"Joey";"No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years."
"Chandler";"Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his handup my leg, and then, there was definite..."
"Ross";"What?"
"Chandler";"Cupping."
"Joey";"That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over,then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (Chandlerand Ross stare at him) What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measurepants?"
"Ross";"Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?"
"Joey";"What? That's not? (Realizes) Oh my God."
"Monica";"Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better."
"Ross";"I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. (Chandler laughs.)"
"Monica";"Thank you. My hair is very amused."
"Chandler";"Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught betweenthe moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true."
"Phoebe";"(to Chandler and Ross) Thank you."
"Ross";"Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach."
"Rachel";"(sticking her head in from the balcony) Wait, are you leaving?"
"Ross";"Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!""
"Rachel";"Well, can I talk to you for a sec?"
"Ross";"Okay. (goes out onto the balcony)"
"Joey";"Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test..."
"Chandler";"That's ok."
"Ross";"What's goin' on?"
"Rachel";"Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just astupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um,second of all (Ross is laughing), what?"
"Ross";"Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of thosethings where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the nextday you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?"
"Rachel";"No. No-no-no-no."
"Ross";"Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean Iactually—I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with aguy like that."
"Rachel";"No, I think that was the whole all."
"Joey";"I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants."
"Julie";"I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like AndieMcDowell's new haircut?"
"Phoebe";"You wanna do it right now?"
"Julie";"Great! (Julie leaves)"
"Phoebe";"(to Rachel) Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell'sthe girl from"
"Rachel";"No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guyfrom"
"Phoebe";"Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you."
"Rachel";"You're welcome."
"Monica";"(entering from her bedroom carrying a present) Ok, these wereunbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but Icouldn't resist. (There a little pair of Nike shoes.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. (Ben starts to cry) Oh my God,oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?"
"Susan";"Oh, is he hungry already?"
"Carol";"I guess so. (Carol starts to breast feed Ben.)"
"Chandler";"You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him)something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)"
"Joey";"(joins him) I gotta get one, too."
"Ross";"(following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?"
"Chandler";"We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?"
"Ross";"Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing inthe world."
"Joey";"Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it."
"Ross";"This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd betterget used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just askquestions. Carol's fine with it, now come on."
"Chandler";"Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question aboutbreast-feeding?"
"Carol";"Sure."
"Joey";"Uh, does it hurt?"
"Carol";"It did at first, but not anymore."
"Joey";"Chandler?"
"Chandler";"So, uh, how often can you do it?"
"Carol";"As much as he needs."
"Joey";"Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one getbigger?"
"Julie";"Rachel, do you have any muffins left?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I forget which ones."
"Julie";"Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?"
"All";"No thanks."
"Julie";"(To Rachel) Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There yougo. (Ties it back up for her)"
"Rachel";"(to Julie) Thank you. (under her breath to Chandler) What a bitch."
"Julie";"Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at"
"Phoebe";"I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet."
"Monica";"Ok, um, I'll go with you."
"Julie";"Great."
"Ross";"(enters) Hi, honey."
"Chandler";"Hey, sweetums."
"Ross";"Hello to the rest."
"All";"Hi!"
"Joey";"Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What aboutRachel?"
"Monica";"It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?"
"Chandler";"Come on, you're going to"
"Monica";"But I'm..."
"Phoebe";"Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street."
"Ross";"(to Monica) So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?"
"Monica";"Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal."
"Ross";"It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this."
"Monica";"You're welcome."
"Phoebe";"Woof, woof."
"Joey";"(A guy walks by) Bijan for men? (Another guy walks by) Bijan for men?(Another guy walks by) Bijan for men? (An attractive woman walks by.)"
"Annabelle";"Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?"
"Joey";"Who?"
"Annabelle";"Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man."
"Joey";"What's he doin' in my section?"
"Annabelle";"I guess he doesn't know."
"Joey";"Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? (To the Hombre Man)Hey, how ya doin'?"
"Hombre Man";"Mornin'."
"Joey";"Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything fromYoung Men's to the escalator is my territory."
"Hombre Man";"Your territory, huh?"
"Joey";"Yeah. Bijan for men?"
"Hombre Man";"Hombre?"

"Annabelle";"You bet. (to Joey) Maybe some other time?"
"Joey";"(To a co-worker) Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboyspraying cologne. (A customer walks by.) Bijan for men? (The customer ignores him, andJoey starts to chase him) Bijan for men?!"

"Ross";"Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh,we play. It's like we're father and son."
"Susan";"Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. (Ross looks at her.) Don't look sosurprised. I'm a lovely person."
"Rachel";"Oh, this is so cute."
"Susan";"Oh, I got that for him."

"Rachel";"Did you just say Hi, Jew?"
"Monica";"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likesit. Reaffirms his faith."
"Phoebe";"Ben, dinner!"
"Ross";"Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it'sbreast milk, and you're not supposed to do that."
"Phoebe";"Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on herwrist and tastes it.)"
"Chandler";"What did you just do?"
"Phoebe";"I licked my arm, what?"
"Ross";"It's breast milk."
"Phoebe";"So?"
"Rachel";"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person."
"Joey";"What is the big deal? (Tastes the breast milk.)"
"Chandler";"What did you just do?"
"Ross";"Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
"Phoebe";"You won't even taste it?"
"Ross";"No!"
"Phoebe";"Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?"
"Ross";"Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it."
"Monica";"Hey, where is everybody?"
"Rachel";"They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?"
"Monica";"Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanksfor your jacket."
"Rachel";"Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. (Puts her hand in thepocket) Here are your keys, hon. (She takes the keys out, sets them on the counter, andnotices she also grabbed a receipt.)"
"Monica";"You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card."
"Rachel";"And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?"
"Monica";"That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent."
"Rachel";"Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?"
"Monica";"Judy."
"Rachel";"Who?"
"Monica";"Julie."
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Monica";"Jody!"
"Rachel";"You were with Julie?"
"Monica";"Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because shewas my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, wewere...shopping."
"Rachel";"Oh. Oh my God."
"Monica";"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me."
"Rachel";"Yeah, right.  Sure!"
"Monica";"Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry,all right. I never meant for you to find out!"
"Rachel";"Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (Waves the receipt)"
"Monica";"That is not true!"
"Rachel";"Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?"
"Monica";"Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?"
"Rachel";"Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to"
"Monica";"(on the phone) Hi, who's this? (Listens) Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?It's Monica. (Listens) Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. (Listens) Joanne, it's not assimple as all that, ok? (Listens) No, I don't care what Steve thinks. (Listens) Hi, Steve."
"Carol";"How did we do?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out."
"Ross";"I did not freak out."
"Carol";"Why'd you freak out?"
"Ross";"Because it's breast milk. It's gross."
"Carol";"My breast milk is gross?"
"Susan";"This should be fun."
"Ross";"No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't thinkbreast milk is for adults."
"Chandler";"Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike."
"Carol";"Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.(Holding out a bottle.)"
"Ross";"(jumping away) That would be no."
"Phoebe";"Come on. It doesn't taste bad."
"Joey";"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
"Susan";"Cantaloupe juice."
"Joey";"Exactly."
"Ross";"(staring at Susan) You've tasted it? You've tasted it."
"Susan";"Uh huh."
"Ross";"Oh, you've tasted it."
"Susan";"You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true."
"Ross";"(he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the bottle andRoss squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the towel and he wipes itoff.)"
"Chandler";"Howdy."
"Joey";"(sitting on the otherside of the counter from Chandler) Gimme a box ajuice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre."
"Chandler";"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
"Joey";"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more peopleon it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this guy, Chandler, he goesthrough two bottles a day."
"Chandler";"(slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do youcare? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you."
"Joey";"I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. (He downsthe glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game.They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."
"Chandler";"(pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that.You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. Andthen where're you gonna run?"
"Joey";"Yeah I guess you're right."
"Chandler";"You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're madeof. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre westof the lingerie."
"Joey";"I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.)"
"Chandler";"All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nicehooker."
"Monica";"I don't know what else to say."
"Rachel";"Well that works out good, because I'm not listening."
"Monica";"I feel terrible, I really do."
"Rachel";"Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?"
"Monica";"Rachel, (they go back inside) say that I'm friends with her, we spendsome time together. Is that so terrible?"
"Rachel";"Yes."
"Monica";"It's that terrible?"
"Rachel";"Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guywho might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually(starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you."
"Monica";"Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean,just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,(starting to cry) you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you."
"Rachel";"I love you too. (They hug.)"
"Phoebe";"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do withme, but um I love you guys too. (Joins in on the hug.) Oh, I really needed that. (Goes andsits down.)"
"Monica";"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need tohate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met aguy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.Would you just give that a chance, for me?"
"Rachel";"(crying) I'd do anything for you, you know that."
"Monica";"(crying) I'd do anything for you. (They hug again.)"
"Phoebe";"Wait, wait, wait, wait! (Runs over and joins in on the hug again.)"
"Joey";"Mornin'. (The Hombre man ignores him) I said, mornin'."
"Hombre Man";"I heard ya."
"Store Guy";"All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?"
"Hombre Man";"Ready."
"Joey";"Yeah, I'm ready."
"Customer";"You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!"
"Store Guy";"Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?"
"Hombre Man";"I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry."
"Annabelle";"(seeing the end result) My god, what happened?"
"Joey";"These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'.Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?"
"Annabelle";"Sure."
"Julie";"So."
"Rachel";"So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, youknow, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us,though, right?"
"Julie";"I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty muchtotally intimidated by you."
"Rachel";"Really? Me?"
"Julie";"Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I reallywanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got thefeeling that maybe you don't."
"Rachel";"Well, you're not totally paranoid."
"Julie";"Oy."
"Rachel";"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, itwas really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, butum, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um,Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
"Julie";"Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime orsomething?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it."
"Julie";"I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later."
"Rachel";"All right, Julie."

"Chandler";"Morning."

"Janice";"(laughs) I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss."
"Chandler";"Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay."

"Monica";"God, look what I found in the drain."
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Monica";"It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do withthis?"
"Ross";"Getting it away from me would be job one."

"Phoebe";"Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in yourcereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it downthe drain.)"
"Monica";"God, what is wrong with me."
"Ross";"You need to get some sleep."
"Monica";"I need to get some Richard."
"Rachel";"Monica, you broke up with him for a reason."
"Monica";"I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired ofwondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!"

"Rachel";"Really!"
"Phoebe";"Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know shestopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know."
"Rachel";"Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!"

"Chandler";"No, Janice."
"Joey";"Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always gotogether, we're like the three hocke-teers."
"Chandler";"You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have aproblem with Janice?"
"Joey";"No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandlerfollows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from theGreek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?"
"Chandler";"Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!"
"Joey";"Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know."
"Chandler";"Well, there you go."
"Joey";"Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive younuts before too, remember?"
"Chandler";"Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing.Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters."
"Joey";"Look, what do you want me to say?"
"Chandler";"I want you to say that you like her!"
"Joey";"I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she startslaughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can havesomething to throw at her."
"Chandler";"Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and bythe way there is no Count Rushmore!"
"Joey";"Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?(Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')"
"Ross";"How could you have told her?"
"Rachel";"Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal."
"Ross";"Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal."
"Rachel";"Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?"
"Ross";"Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us."
"Rachel";"Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each othereverything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all thatlocker room stuff."
"Ross";"That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Whodid it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'."
"Rachel";"Were both of those Joey?"
"Ross";"Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, yourgirlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her."
"Rachel";"Not even with your best friend."
"Ross";"Noo!"
"Rachel";"That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bondingand the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the samething you are."
"Ross";"Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?"
"Rachel";"Pretty much."
"Ross";"Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about thenight of five times?"
"Rachel";"Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol."
"Ross";"I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think."
"Phoebe";"( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to theplinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell meyour happy place."
"Monica";"Richard's living room, drinking wine."
"Phoebe";"All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. Andget out!"
"Monica";"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place."
"Phoebe";"Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have toask that you don't move anything."
"Monica";"All right, I'll try not to."
"Phoebe";"Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky...."
"Monica";"Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?"
"Phoebe";"All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, thewarm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees...."
"Monica";"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine."
"Phoebe";"All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, notpermitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, andthe, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook...."
"Monica";"Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee."
"Janice";"So, I hear, you hate me!"
"Joey";"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that."
"Janice";"A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm offand throw it at me."
"Joey";"And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there..."
"Janice";"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something aboutour little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality timetogether."
"Joey";"But what does that gonna do..."
"Janice";"For Chandler!"
"Joey";"Okay. I'm in."
"Janice";"Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's"
"Joey";"Does it have to be a whole day?"
"Janice";"Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me."
"Joey";"Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room."
"Monica";"(crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it wasthose videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War."
"Phoebe";"Monica, do you want us to take you home?"
"Monica";"Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica,and Phoebe leave)"
"Ross";"Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?"
"Chandler";"Umm, yeah."
"Ross";"No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique,stamina, girth...."
"Chandler";"Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?"
"Ross";"Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doingit. Do you wanna?"
"Chandler";"We're not gonna talk about girth are we?"
"Ross";"Nooo!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, okay."
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Chandler";"Yeah! All right! You go first."
"Ross";"Okay, okay, I'll go first."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Ross";"So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies,and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing...."
"Chandler";"Princess Leia in the gold bikini."
"Ross";"Yes!"
"Chandler";"I know!"
"Ross";"Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Ross";"Okay."
"Chandler";"Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman."
"Ross";"Hmph."
"Chandler";"And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all theselike, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at theXerox place...."
"Ross";"With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!"
"Chandler";"I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. Andyour like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can'tpossibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it'skinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!"
"Ross";"Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is thematter with you?"
"Chandler";"You said..."
"Ross";"I said '"
"Janice";"We're baack!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"What are you guys doing together?"
"Janice";"Joey and Janice's"
"Chandler";"Really."
"Joey";"Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, Ilove this woman. You have got competition buddy."
"Janice";"I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so.I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler. (laughs)"
"Chandler";"You still can't stand her can you?"
"Joey";"I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did."
"Chandler";"Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot."
"Joey";"But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole daytogether and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at SheaStadium."
"Chandler";"Well, I guess that's something."
"Joey";"No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which meansI get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Joey";"Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran intoRoss."
"Chandler";"Oh God!"
"Joey";"Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too."
"Chandler";"Really?"
"Joey";"Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex."
"Monica";"Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?"
"Mr. Geller";"Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would comeinto the city for a little Monicuddle. (hugs her) Since when did you start smoking cigars?"
"Monica";"I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are youreally doing here Dad?"
"Mr. Geller";"Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay."
"Monica";"What makes you think that I might not be okay?"
"Mr. Geller";"I saw Richard."
"Monica";"Oh."
"Mr. Geller";"So, how are you doing?"
"Monica";"I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?"
"Mr. Geller";"You don't wanna know."
"Monica";"No, I really, really do."
"Mr. Geller";"Well, he's doing terrible!"
"Monica";"Really!"
"Mr. Geller";"Worse than when he broke up with Barbara."
"Monica";"You're not just saying that are you?"
"Mr. Geller";"No, the man is a mess."
"Monica";"Was he crying?"
"Mr. Geller";"No."
"Monica";"Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?"
"Mr. Geller";"Maybe."
"Monica";"I think so."
"Mr. Geller";"Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You knowafter we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather,wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam'snickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, (turnsaround and sees that Monica is sleeping and puts a blanket around her, kisses her, picksup the cigar, and starts watching the video)"
"Rachel";"Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird lookon your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What?Did you just picture it differently? What? What?"
"Ross";"No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Momstanding where Rachel is)"
"Ross";"I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. (Rachel starts looking aroundand down, with a 'What the hell is going on?' look on her face.)"
"Joey";"All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. (takes aglass from the fridge.)"
"Chandler";"Taste it."
"Joey";"(drinks from the glass and puts it back in the fridge) Yep, it's fat. I drankfat!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago."
"Ross";"(entering) Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey, mister tux!"
"Ross";"Why aren't you guys dressed?"
"Joey";"We have a half hour."
"Ross";"No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door attwenty to eight."
"Joey";"Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed."
"Ross";"Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now."
"Joey";"Joey:"
"Rachel";"(entering from bathroom) Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy."
"Ross";"Really."
"Rachel";"Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi."
"Ross";"Hi."
"Rachel";"How come you didn't come over earlier?"
"Ross";"'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man."
"Joey";"Hey, Ross, want some cider?"
"Ross";"No. (to Rachel) So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on,hair's done."
"Rachel";"Yeah, I just have to get dressed."
"Ross";"Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes."
"Rachel";"Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing."
"Joey";"Glass of fat?"
"Joey";"What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?"
"Ross";"No! Do you wanna hear it?"
"Joey";"Am I in it?"
"Ross";"Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, Ising a song about the wonder that is Joey."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hello."

"Ross";"Wow, hello! You look great!"
"Phoebe";"Thank you! I know, though."
"Ross";"You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are mystar."
"Phoebe";"Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny."
"Chandler";"(entering from bathroom, with an issue of Cosmo) All right, I took thequiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. (to Joey) Get up."
"Joey";"What?"
"Chandler";"You're in my seat."
"Joey";"How is this your seat?"
"Chandler";"'Cause I was sitting there."
"Joey";"But then you left."
"Chandler";"Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew Iwas coming back."
"Joey";"What's the big deal, sit somewhere else."
"Chandler";"The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat."
"Joey";"Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there (points to thebathroom). Soo..."
"Ross";"You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you bothhave to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So.."
"Chandler";"All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not abig deal. (yells at Joey) GET UP!!"
"Monica";"(entering) Hi."
"Monica";"Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!"
"Phoebe";"All right all ready."

"Ross";"That's, that's funny. Change!"
"Monica";"Hang on a second I just got in."

"Phoebe";"We could not, would not want to wait."
"Ross";"Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyonewill see if we arrive after it starts."
"Monica";"Has somebody been drinking my fat? (Joey and Chandler look at each other)"
"Rachel";"(entering from her bedroom) You guys, (holds up an outfit) does this looklike something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?"
"Phoebe";"I don't know, you might be the first one."
"Monica";"Rach, did you check the machine?"
"Rachel";"Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves lookfat. Nevermind."
"Chandler";"Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up."
"Joey";"All right! You can have the chair."
"Chandler";"Really!"
"Joey";"Oh my, would you look at that! (holds up crossed fingers)"
"Phoebe";"(on machine) "Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'malready there when your playing this message?" (to the guys) Is that too spooky?"
"Ross";"(on machine) "Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel.Rach!""
"Rachel";"(entering from her bedroom) What?!"
"Ross";"Nevermind."
"Monica";"Is-is-is that message old or new? (yelling) Old or new?! Old or new?!"
"Ross";"It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?"
"Monica";"What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we hadsomething really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?"
"Chandler";"Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old."
"Ross";"Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through thesame thing. And you know what I did?"
"Monica";"Huh?"
"Ross";"I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. (Rachel starts tofollow Monica into her room, but Ross stops her and sends her back to her room.) There wego, there we go."
"Chandler";"You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I justhope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. (holds his hand a couple of inches infront of Joey's face) Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Nottouching can't get mad! (Joey flings some dip onto Phoebe's dress)"
"Phoebe";"Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!"
"Joey";"Joey:"
"Joey";"I'm so sorry."
"Phoebe";"What am I gonna do?"
"Ross";"No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! (clapping) What gets out hummus?! Whatgets out hummus?!"
"Phoebe";"Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus."
"Monica";"If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?"
"Phoebe";"Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that."
"Chandler";"Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy."
"Monica";"So, should I call him back?"
"Chandler";"All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. (sits onJoey's lap) I'm soooo, comfortable."
"Joey";"Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable."
"Chandler";"All right! (jumps up)"
"Ross";"Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go andchange! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacatedthe chair. Okay. Okay."
"Chandler";"All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, andI'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! (leaves)"
"Rachel";"(entering from her room) Is this a little too... (sees Phoebe) Pheebs, whathappened?"
"Phoebe";"Hummus. I got the hummus."
"Rachel";"Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my blackjacket?"
"Phoebe";"That won't go with this dress though."
"Rachel";"No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out ofthat. Come on."
"Ross";"No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes."
"Rachel";"Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?"
"Monica";"I called him."
"Monica";"Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay,it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God,what if it wasn't breezy?"
"Phoebe";"Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such abreezy place."
"Monica";"Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell meif it's breezy enough."
"Joey";"Monica, how are you gonna do that?"
"Monica";"I know the code to his answering machine."
"Ross";"Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you aredialing."
"Machine";""You have two new messages.""
"Joey";"Wow, what a cool job. (in a machine voice) 'You have two new messages.''Please, pass the pie.'"
"Monica";"(on machine) "Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got thismessage from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. Solet me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy.""
"Joey";"Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy."
"Joey";"Now she sounded breezy."
"Monica";"He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone."
"Phoebe";"Monica, you don't know that."
"Monica";"Well, who's voice was that?"
"Chandler";"Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's."
"Monica";"Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?"
"Ross";"Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab."
"Monica";"It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle."
"Rachel";"Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn'twork, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!"
"Ross";"You don't, you don't know what your wearing?"
"Rachel";"Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night."
"Ross";"Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right,come on, I'll just pick something out for you."
"Chandler";"All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, havenoticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair,dillhole!""
"Joey";"Okay. (he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)"
"Chandler";"What are you doing?"
"Joey";"You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about thecushions."
"Chandler";"The cushions are the essence of the chair!"
"Joey";"That's right! I'm taking the essence."
"Chandler";"Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room."
"Ross";"Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty."
"Rachel";"Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to thisthing as Little Bo Peep."
"Ross";"Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep."
"Rachel";"Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days."
"Phoebe";"Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me! (she's wearing anotherdress on a hanger around her neck)"
"Rachel";"Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight."
"Phoebe";"Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!"
"Ross";"Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?"
"Rachel";"No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you."
"Chandler";"We used them as pillows when we went camping."
"Ross";"What?"
"Chandler";"(shyly) The sheep."
"Ross";"Hey, what you do on your own time..."
"Joey";"(entering) Where's my underwear?!"
"Ross";"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?"
"Chandler";"He took my essence!"
"Ross";"Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you'rewearing now?"
"Joey";"Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now."
"Ross";"Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?"
"Joey";"It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues."
"Chandler";"Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody hiscushions."
"Joey";"Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you."
"Chandler";"What are you, what are you gonna"
"Joey";"Hey, opposite, is opposite! (leaves)"
"Chandler";"He's got nothing!"
"Phoebe";"(entering from Rachel's room, wearing a huge bow to cover the stain) Okay,I'm ready."
"Chandler";"Chandler:"
"Phoebe";"Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmasribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'"
"Chandler";"What are you supporting?"
"Phoebe";"Duh!! Christmas!"
"Ross";"Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelveminutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. (shows Chandler) Okay, see, the, the dinosaurtail isn't going around any more. (grabs Chandler's watch) What time is it? It's 7:33, Ihave seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!"
"Rachel";"(entering from her room) Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? Theblack or the purple?"
"Ross";"Just, just, just pick one!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the littlestrappys?"
"Rachel";"Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wearpants?"
"Ross";"Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go withoutany pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt inthere and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match.I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay."
"Rachel";"But I..."
"Ross";"No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go."
"Rachel";"All right."
"Ross";"Thank you!"
"Monica";"(entering from her room) Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if thatwas her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to."
"Ross";"It was, it was her voice."
"Chandler";"Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place."
"Monica";"Okay. That was her right?"
"Phoebe";"Definitely."
"Monica";"See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now."
"Ross";"Yay!"
"Phoebe";"I'll get it, okay. (answers phone) Hi, Monica and Rachel's. (listens) Yeah,just a second, can I ask who's calling. (to Monica) Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, shemust have that Caller Id thing. You should get that."
"Monica";"(on phone) Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number bymistake. (listens) Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really misshim. Well, you know how it is, it's that...."
"Chandler";"(to Phoebe) You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. Butwhenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean,what is that about?"
"Monica";"(on phone) Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I meanthat's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it ifyou didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Comeon we're friends!! (Michelle hangs up) That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back."
"Ross";"No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick."
"Monica";"Okay, fine. (runs to her room)"
"Chandler";"They got a phone in there, right?"
"Phoebe";"Okay, we're on it. We're on it."
"Ross";"Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it alittle, um."
"Rachel";"I'm not gonna gooo."
"Ross";"You're not going to go."
"Rachel";"No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence."
"Ross";"How, how, um how can you not be going?"
"Rachel";"I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going."
"Ross";"Um, you know, just out of curiosity..."
"Rachel";"Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'mjust, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood."
"Ross";"Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled."
"Rachel";"It's fine."
"Ross";"No, but, your-your mad."
"Rachel";"I'm not mad."
"Ross";"No."
"Rachel";"I'm just not going."
"Ross";"Your not going."
"Rachel";"Right."
"Ross";"Okay. You know that I-I have to go."
"Rachel";"Um, hum."
"Ross";"Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'"
"Rachel";"No."
"Ross";"No, because your not upset."
"Rachel";"Right."
"Ross";"About the yelling."
"Rachel";"Right, and the humiliating."
"Ross";"Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay."
"Rachel";"Um, hum."
"Ross";"We're good."
"Rachel";"Right."
"Ross";"Okay. Honey?"
"Rachel";"Yes, Ross. (turns toward him)"
"Ross";"I love you. (goes to kiss her and she turns away.)"
"Phoebe";"(yelling from the bedroom) Get away from that! No! (she comes into theliving room carrying the phone) She's just getting dressed."
"Chandler";"Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?"
"Joey";"Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything youown."
"Chandler";"Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!"
"Joey";"Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I"
"Chandler";"Oooo-ooh!"
"Joey";"Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, Idon't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)"
"Ross";"Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I'vehad it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!"
"Chandler";"Jeez, what a baby."
"Joey";"Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed."
"Ross";"You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, isthe one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-Iwa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, whatcan I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there."
"Joey";"You could drink the fat."
"Ross";"Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation."
"Rachel";"No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait aminute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting."
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"I think you"
"Joey";"Yaaaay!"
"Ross";"Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, andhow much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do."
"Phoebe";"Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out."
"Ross";"I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake,with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers. (starts to drink, but Rachel stops him justbefore he starts drinking)"
"Rachel";"No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!"
"Ross";"You will?!"
"Rachel";"You were really gonna do that, weren't you?"
"Ross";"Well, yeah."
"Rachel";"You were gonna drink the fat."
"Joey";"Let's see what else he'll do!"
"Ross";"(to Joey) How 'bout instead you, go get changed! (to Chandler) You, give himback his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in twominutes! Monica!"
"Chandler";"Stop it. Stop it!"
"Phoebe";"Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No,Monica, no!"
"Machine";"You have three new messages."
"Monica";"Not any more!"
"Machine";"Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone."
"Monica";"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazytonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, Ibeeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you knowwhat Michelle will tell you the rest.

"Machine";"Good-bye."
"Monica";"Noooo!!!!"
"Ross";"(entering) Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!"
"Monica";"Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message.Maybe they can change his number."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself."
"Ross";"Rachel!! (she enters) Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!"
"Rachel";"And I still have about five seconds to spare. (kisses him) Okay, that wasabout seven seconds."
"Ross";"So we're a little late."
"Rachel";"Come on. (they start to leave) Oh! And, uh, by the way...."
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"I'm going commando, too."
"Ross";"Awwww!!!"
"Sherman Whitfield";"Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute."
"Ross";"Wow! What a pleasure."
"Whitfield";"(sits down) Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with yourpaper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written."
"Chandler";"Excuse me. Hi."
"Whitfield";"Yes?"
"Chandler";"Well, your kind of sitting in my seat."
"Whitfield";"What do you mean, your seat?"
"Chandler";"I mean, I was sitting there."
"Whitfield";"But, you got up!"
"Chandler";"But, I never left the room!"
"Whitfield";"But, you left the chair area."
"Chandler";"All right, that's it, give me your underwear."
"Joey";"(from bedroom) WHOAA!!"
"Chandler";"(going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you notto jump on the bed."
"Monica";"Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock thismorning."
"Ross";"Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?"
"Monica";"Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale."

"Rachel";"Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?"
"Joey";"Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out."
"Chandler";"Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that itjust *fell* out of the socket."
"Joey";"What is this? Fruit?"
"Rachel";"Monica's making jam."
"Joey";"Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam atour place?"
"Chandler";"Because the kids need new shoes."
"Monica";"I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressedabout Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man?Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joeyrealizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)"
"Joey";"This will just be my batch."
"Phoebe";"(turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why haveyou been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you."

"Phoebe";"Oh, you're not a dingus."
"Guy";"I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meetyour sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones."
"Phoebe";"Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this isjust what, what she does to guys, okay."
"Guy";"Well thanks. (starts to leave)"
"Phoebe";"Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was inJunior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there wasthis guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. Hesaid okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?"
"Guy";"Not really."
"Phoebe";"Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really niceguy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay."
"Guy";"Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice.Here (gives her the flowers he bought.)"

"Rachel";"What, what, what?"
"Ross";"It's an empty apartment."
"Rachel";"Oooh."
"Ross";"We're all alone in an empty apartment."
"Rachel";"Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes (Ross startskissing her neck) Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.(they fall onto the couch)"
"Ross";"There it is."
"Rachel";"Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey."
"Ross";"Hey."
"Chandler";"Do I look fat?"
"Rachel";"Rachel:"
"Chandler";"Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took thatto mean that I was calling her a cow."
"Rachel";"Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it."
"Chandler";"Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked ather...."
"Ross";"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it'sjust a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?"
"Rachel";"Nooo!"
"Ross";"And it works both ways."
"Chandler";"Okay, so you both just know this stuff?"
"Rachel";"Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on."
"Ross";"Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and shegives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?"
"Chandler";"That's easy, baggage claim."
"Ross";"(buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option numberthree, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her."
"Chandler";"Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janicelikes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want togo to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know,accidentally calling her fat or something."
"Rachel";"Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlilysleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Okay, I'm late for work."
"Ross";"Oh."
"Rachel";"All right are you guys gonna come down?"
"Ross";"Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you."
"Rachel";"Good luck Chandler."
"Chandler";"Thank you Rachel."
"Ross";"Bye sweetie."
"Rachel";"Bye hon."
"Ross";"(blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, butthere is something you can do."
"Chandler";"Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers."
"Ross";"Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room.Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder andthigh.) Okay, you're in bed..."
"Chandler";"Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)"
"Ross";"I'm gonna use the cushion."
"Chandler";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait forher to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her backover to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you."
"Chandler";"Okay, the old hug and roll."
"Ross";"Yep."
"Chandler";"Okay, one question."
"Ross";"Shoot."
"Chandler";"You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?"
"Joey";"Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at themovies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?"
"Rachel";"(Looks at him) You're so pretty."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hi!"
"All";"Hey, Phoebe."
"Phoebe";"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to himtoday."
"Joey";"(with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?"
"Phoebe";"Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway hisname is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I wasUrsula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Causeof the restraining order."
"Chandler";"Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom."
"Phoebe";"Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, thisvery passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, youknow. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute."
"Ross";"Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker."
"Phoebe";"No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like youknow, like I did for Joey after he went out with her."
"Joey";"(with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe withcrumbs)"
"Phoebe";"Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather."
"Monica";"(entering) Hey guys."
"All";"Hey Mon."
"Monica";"Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry curin."
"Joey";"Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!"
"Chandler";"Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holdsup one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)"
"Joey";"Put your hands together."
"Monica";"Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch."
"Joey";"No more jam?!"
"Rachel";"Well, what happened to your jam plan?"
"Monica";"I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even.So, I've got a new plan now. Babies."
"Chandler";"Well, your gonna need much bigger jars."
"Ross";"What are you talking about?"
"Monica";"I'm talking about me having a baby."
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"Are you serious?"
"Monica";"Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of mylife. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that'swhen I came up with the baby plan."
"Ross";"Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is thatguy's name? Dad!"
"Monica";"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, ifI have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's juststupid."
"Chandler";"That, that's what's stupid."
"Monica";"I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. Andthere, there are places you can go to get that stuff."
"Rachel";"Down at the docks again?"
"Janice";"Night-night Bing-a-ling."
"Chandler";"Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self)"
"Malcom";"Here's my binoculars."
"Phoebe";"Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Goingstrong. Keep going."
"Malcom";"These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to readwhen I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun."
"Phoebe";"Oh, yeah. What's this? (picks up a book)"
"Malcom";"Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna heresomething from it?"
"Phoebe";"Um, not even a little bit."
"Malcom";"It's about you."
"Phoebe";"Oh, okay then."
"Malcom";"(reading) I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'msuch a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird,but kinda cool."
"Phoebe";"Good. So what were you thinking?"
"Malcom";"I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you."
"Phoebe";"Really?"
"Malcom";"No."
"Phoebe";"Oh."
"Malcom";"See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you."
"Phoebe";"Oh, okay. (he kisses her)"
"Chandler";"No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard."
"Monica";"(entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come ondown! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis."
"Chandler";"You mean there's more than one of us."
"Ross";"Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna,I'm, I'm gonna....."
"Monica";"You're gonna what?"
"Ross";"I'm gonna tell Mom."
"Rachel";"Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy."
"Ross";"Crazy."
"Monica";"What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way tosomething...."
"Ross";"(interrupting her) Oh, it's not the ideal way..."
"Monica";"Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm soready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?"
"Joey";"Check it out!! Jam crackers!"
"Monica";"Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor,born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. (they all turnand look at Joey) Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'"
"Joey";"Yeah, the Knicks rule!"
"Monica";"Joey, this is you!"
"Joey";"Let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) Oh, right."
"Rachel";"When did you go to a sperm bank?"
"Joey";"Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey,Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?"
"Chandler";"And that's how you bought it?"
"Joey";"Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprisedthere's any of my boys left."
"Monica";"Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocketscientist here."
"Joey";"Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives'on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hellooo!"
"All";"Hey."
"Ross";"How's the maniac?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'."
"Rachel";"Phoebe, what are you doing?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. Hequit for me."
"Rachel";"Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows howlong, okay, you don't just give up something like that."
"Phoebe";"Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything."
"Ross";"You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?"
"Phoebe";"What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still followingher?"
"Chandler";"Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order."
"Phoebe";"What are you saying I should do?"
"Monica";"I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him."
"Phoebe";"Thank you, Monica."
"Joey";"Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes."
"Monica";"Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine."
"Rachel";"Oh my God, what happened? (points to the cast on Janice's wrist)"
"Janice";"Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!"
"Rachel";"Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun."
"Janice";"Oh, (laughs) I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Rollthing."
"Rachel";"(turns around, not amused) Ross's what?"
"Janice";"You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh...my....God."
"Malcom";"Phoebe?"
"Phoebe";"Yes? Yes! Oh."
"Malcom";"What are you doing?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich.Oh, here it is! Oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)"
"Malcom";"Were you following me?"
"Phoebe";"Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that youwere still hung up on my sister."
"Malcom";"So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me. (Ursula walkspast, and Malcom finds behind the pillar)"
"Phoebe";"Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Justwalkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did youknow she takes this train?"
"Malcom";"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic."
"Phoebe";"No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause Imade you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'causeyour, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitelyhelp you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll belike an Ursula patch."
"Malcom";"Uh-huh, I don't know."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind thepillar, which way am I gonna go?"
"Joey";"Hey."
"Monica";"Hey."
"Joey";"Where you going?"
"Monica";"To the bank."
"Joey";"Sperm or regular?"
"Monica";"Sperm."
"Joey";"So you're really doing this, huh?"
"Monica";"Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135."
"Joey";"Sounds nice."
"Monica";"'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes..."
"Joey";"No kiddin', hmm."
"Monica";"What?"
"Joey";"No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy."
"Monica";"Really? Why?"
"Joey";"I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall,smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt."
"Monica";"Hoyt?"
"Joey";"It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a bigpool."
"Monica";"Really, is he a swimmer?"
"Joey";"He's got the body for it."
"Monica";"I like that. (Joey starts laughing) What?"
"Joey";"You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet,so don't pee in our pool.', you know."
"Monica";"We do not have one of those signs."
"Joey";"Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three greatkids."
"Monica";"Two girls and a boy?"
"Joey";"Yeah!"
"Monica";"And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're,they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three ofthem."
"Joey";"Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds goodtoo."
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Joey";"Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stopshugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) forlike a day. (hugs her again)."
"Joey";"I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit ofTribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest ofthe jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) Maybe ifthey met me in person."
"Rachel";"Honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)"
"Joey";"(wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) Did I get it?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Ross";"(entering) Hello."
"Rachel";"Hello."
"Ross";"(sees Joey) Hey. (walks into the living room) Uh, Chan, can I uh, can Italk to you for a second?"
"Chandler";"Sure. What's up?"
"Ross";"Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something youralready familiar with, uh, women talk! (smacks Chandler over the head with a magazine)"
"Phoebe";"Phoebe:"
"Joey";"You guys, can we please not watch this all right."
"All";"Shhhh!"
"Joey";"(on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on thecounter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!"
"Mike";"And there is Kevin."
"Joey";"Joey:"
"Rachel";"Noo way, Kevin."
"Ross";"Ross:"
"Chandler";"You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!"
"Joey";"(on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy.(starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday."
"Chandler";"Well, it's official there are no good movies."
"Janice";"Well, let's go to a bad one and make out. (they start to kiss and leanback into Monica.)"
"Monica";"Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways on thecouch) so that you can bunny bump against my back."
"Joey";"(entering) Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey."
"Chandler";"Hey, man. What's up?"
"Joey";"Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up atthe audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. Howcould you not give me the message?!"
"Chandler";"Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me."
"Phoebe";"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay, it wasme!"
"Joey";"How is it you?"
"Phoebe";"Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler wasin the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows himher hand)"
"Joey";"Yep, that's my audition."
"Monica";"See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere."
"Phoebe";"Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play."
"Janice";"What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment."
"Joey";"Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missedmy chance."
"Phoebe";"That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault."
"Joey";"Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends,she only talks to agents."
"Phoebe";"What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts dialing)."
"Joey";"What, what are you doing? What are you doing?"
"Phoebe";"No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice)'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe,she'll know what it's about.'"
"Joey";"Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs it and hetries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't because of the sling.)"
"Phoebe";"(on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani,apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don'tknow what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns downthe apartment, the world does not stop.'"
"Chandler";"Is anybody else scared?"
"Phoebe";"(on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that isit for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (toMonica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so shetilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)"
"Chandler";"Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!"
"Monica";"Oh, now you want a pad."
"Susan";"Susan:"
"Ross";"There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is holding aBarbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a"
"Carol";"He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it."
"Susan";"He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with skiboots and a kicky beret."
"Ross";"Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?"
"Susan";"So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up andbe in show business."
"Carol";"This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised bytwo women, does it?"
"Ross";"You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the"
"Ross";"Give daddy the"
"Rachel";"Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?(uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her cereal)"
"Monica";"(entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my leftboob?"
"Joey";"I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)"
"Monica";"There it is. Joey, what are you doing?"
"Joey";"I'm sorry, it just felt nice."
"Chandler";"(entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone."
"Joey";"Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me.Go get me a sweater."
"Chandler";"Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to seeher tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight."
"Rachel";"What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?"
"Chandler";"Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half herchicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes."
"Ross";"And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?"
"Chandler";"Noo."
"Ross";"You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important toyou."
"Chandler";"No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarmstarted going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'"
"Rachel";"Men are unbelievable."
"Monica";"What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feelsomething, you have to run away?"
"Chandler";"I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train ofthought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to saysomething stupid."
"Monica";"Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant untilyou get us to break up with you."
"Joey";"Hey, you know about that?!"
"Chandler";"Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid ofthe commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!"
"Ross";"(to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment."
"Chandler";"Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do wehave any thoughts here?"
"Joey";"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understandit, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, itseems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fearof heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be themost committed guy there ever was."
"Rachel";"Amazingly, that makes sense."
"Chandler";"You think?"
"Joey";"Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel ofthe gun, pee into the wind!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'mpretty much peeing every which way."
"Phoebe";"Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?"
"Rachel";"Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies andpretend agents."
"Joey";"Come on baby, come on!"
"Phoebe";"(on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning apage. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'"
"Rachel";"Very nice touch."
"Phoebe";"(in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on phone) Um, hiAnnie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, 'Will he workfor scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to signifyyes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love tohave lunch with you, how about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through atunnel."
"Rachel";"Unbelievable."
"Joey";"Thank you so much."
"Phoebe";"It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before."
"Joey";"You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there'sthis one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time."
"Joey";"Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two."
"Phoebe";"Two?"
"Joey";"Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I loveyou."
"Phoebe";"Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right"
"Joey";"Nooo, four."
"Janice";"So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?"
"Chandler";"'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)"
"Janice";"Ohhh, are you a puppy! (opens it) Contact paper! I never really knowwhat to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper."
"Chandler";"Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go intoyour brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser."
"Janice";"Oh, you didn't have to do this."
"Chandler";"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's whatgirlfriends should, should get."
"Janice";"Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thoughtthat someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer."
"Chandler";"Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there'smore. We should take a trip."
"Janice";"We should?"
"Chandler";"Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet yourparents. We should take a trip with your parents!"
"Janice";"(laughs) I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out rightnow! Are you okay?"
"Chandler";"I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I havefeared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probablysay 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay."
"Janice";"You probably want us to move in together?"
"Chandler";"It doesn't scare me!"
"Janice";"Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. Youknow, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking aboutmoving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting alittle late, and I-I should just, um...(starts to leave)"
"Chandler";"Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'mhopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janiceto leave a message on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wannaapologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)"
"Rachel";"Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)"
"Chandler";"So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is goingto fast and we have to slow down."
"Monica";"Monica:"
"Monica";"That is never good."
"Chandler";"Then I got all needy and clingy."
"Rachel";"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not sobad. How did you leave it?"
"Chandler";"She said she'd call me."
"Monica";"Monica:"
"Chandler";"Oh God."
"Monica";"Welcome to our side of the tunnel."
"Chandler";"This ice cream tastes like crap by the way."
"Rachel";"Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, wesave the real stuff for those really terminal cases."
"Monica";"You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switchto low-fat."
"Rachel";"Yeah, you do."
"Chandler";"So, you don't think I'm terminal?"
"Monica";"Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need somedamage control."
"Chandler";"Okay, okay. So, should I call her?"
"Monica";"Monica:"
"Rachel";"This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reachingfor that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You wanther back you have to start acting aloof."
"Monica";"She has to know that your not ready."
"Rachel";"Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into heron purpose. And then act aloof."
"Chandler";"So I'm not, not gonna lose her?"
"Rachel";"Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser."
"Chandler";"I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'"
"Rachel";"Oh."
"Ross";"Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. (singing) 'Areal American hero. I'm"
"Joey";"(entering)"
"Ross";"Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!"
"Ross";"Ross:"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Helloo! Oh! (sees Joey and starts to leave)"
"Joey";"Pheebs! There you are!"
"Phoebe";"No it's not, sorry."
"Joey";"But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! (catches her in the hallway)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, inthose....pants."
"Joey";"Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think Igot a shot at it."
"Phoebe";"Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it,I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
"Joey";"It's okay, these things happen."
"Phoebe";"But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible,terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that."
"Joey";"I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit,okay, I just quit."
"Joey";"No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs,rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally."
"Phoebe";"Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italianactor with a worse Italian accent."
"Joey";"They actually said that?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I..."
"Joey";"No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. Youknow, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. (ina very bad Italian accent) I canna work on a new accent."
"Phoebe";"Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah."
"Ross";"(running into the hall, in slow motion) You'll never get me, Joe!!! (hethen pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against Joey and Chandler'sdoor, dead.)"
"Janice";"(to butcher) No, thank you. (Chandler makes a sound and she notices him)Chandler!"
"Chandler";"(in a British accent) Hello, Janice."
"Janice";"What are you doing here?"
"Chandler";"(in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?"
"Janice";"Are you being British?!"
"Chandler";"(normal voice) No. Not anymore."
"Janice";"Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were youhere waiting for me?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for aparty. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)"
"Janice";"Barley? What kind of party serves barley?"
"Chandler";"Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."
"Janice";"Where is this party?"
"Chandler";"Here in Chelsea."
"Janice";"Who's party is it?"
"Chandler";"A woman's"
"Janice";"What woman?!"
"Chandler";"(shyly) Chelsea."
"Janice";"Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you'reseeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or,else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic thatI could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys doyou want to be? (another guy walks by)"
"Chandler";"Can I be that guy?"
"Phoebe";"Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on."
"Joey";"Okay, shoot."
"Phoebe";"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial."
"Joey";"I didn't get it?"
"Phoebe";"No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you canwork on that."
"Joey";"Okay, what else?"
"Phoebe";"Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'"
"Joey";"Oh."
"Phoebe";"Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'"
"Joey";"Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate thisPheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle."
"Phoebe";"Oh."
"Joey";"Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but atleast with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, no, I understand."
"Joey";"You do, thanks."
"Phoebe";"Yeah. Sorry. (she starts to leave)"
"Joey";"Wait a minute."
"Phoebe";"What?"
"Joey";"Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out ofbeing my agent."
"Phoebe";"(in a coy tone) Oh, you caught me. I am so busted."
"Joey";"(in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I suspected-ah."
"Chandler";"....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ranout of the store."
"Monica";"My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'."
"Chandler";"I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice creamnow, right?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, it is."
"Monica";"You know what, everything's gonna be okay."
"Chandler";"(answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second?Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?"
"Rachel";"Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented."
"Monica";"If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call."
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"Hello!"
"Monica";"Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just wokeup, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy."
"Rachel";"Yes, and grumpy."
"Chandler";"What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice. Hi, I'mso glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's justbecause I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid acouple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?! (listens) Really?!"
"Rachel";"He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebodyelse by now."
"Chandler";"(on phone) I love you too."
"Monica";"Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good' ice cream)"
"Ross";"Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose."
"Susan";"What'd you do, dip it in sugar?"
"Ross";"Look,"
"Monica";"What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. Youused to dress up like a woman."
"Ross";"What?"
"Monica";"Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time."
"Ross";"What are you talking about?"
"Monica";"The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag."
"Ross";"Okay, you are totally making this up."
"Monica";"How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea."
"Ross";"(remembering) Oh God."
"Susan";"I've literally never been this happy."
"Monica";"Wasn't there a little song?"
"Carol";"Oh please God, let there be a song."
"Ross";"There was no song. (to Monica) There was no song!"
"Monica";"(singing) '"
"Ross";"Okay."
"Monica";"'"
"Ross";"Okay, that's, that's enough. (retreats to the bathroom)"
"Monica";"'...."
"Ross";"(coming out of the bathroom) Won't you dance around with me."
"Monica";"A-ha!!! (they all start laughing, as Ross hides in the bathroom)"
"Ross";"Ross:"
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?"
"Joey";"No. Y'know how we’re always saying we need a place for the mail."

"Chandler";"You’re building a post office?"
"Joey";"No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It’s aone day job, max."
"Chandler";"Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word!Those are snug."
"Joey";"Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente’s."
"Joey";"Power saw kinda got away from me there."
"Rachel";"(joining Phoebe outside) Hey Pheebs."
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Any sign of your brother?"
"Phoebe";"No, but he’s always late."
"Rachel";"I thought you only met him once?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know,‘Frank’s always late.’"
"Rachel";"Well relax, he’ll be here."
"Phoebe";"No, I know, I’m just nervous. Y'know it’s just y'knowMom’s dead, don’t talk to my sister, Grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately.It’s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing.You’re so sweet to wait with me."
"Rachel";"Well, actually Gunther sent me. You’re not allowed to have cups outhere, it’s a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)"
"Chandler";"Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?"
"Monica";"No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox."

"Joey";"Hey, Monica, who would yours be?"
"Monica";"First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list."
"Joey";"It’s just a game Mon. (makes a ‘Can-you-believe-her’ faceto the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?"

"Rachel";"Hardy Boy."
"Chandler";"Peter Parker."
"Ross";"Thank you."
"Rachel";"What about you honey, who would be on your list?"

"Chandler";"(coughing) What a geek!"

"Phoebe";"Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we’re gonna connect, y'know bond, andeverything."
"Frank";"Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pickup some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of ahooker."
"Chandler";"You know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city."
"Joey";"I know."
"Joey";"Oh, I’m sorry. Did I get ‘ya?"
"Chandler";"No, you didn’t get me!! It’s an electric drill, you"

"Monica";"I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)"
"Joey";"Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used tobe. (Monica gasps) Yeah."
"Monica";"I can’t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?"
"Joey";"Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comesright off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, inhis tight pants.)"
"Monica";"That’s a little more than I wanted to see."
"Joey";"(manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch ofthis stuff is glued down. It’d take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you shouldjust leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)"
"Monica";"I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor."
"Joey";"Eh! There you go."

"Phoebe";"(sits up) Oh, ew!"
"Frank";"What?"

"Ross";"And!! Isabella Rosselini."
"Chandler";"Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she’s toointernational, y'know she’s never gonna be around."
"Rachel";"So?"
"Chandler";"So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who’s gonna be in thecountry like all the time."

"Monica";"Oh, how do you play the shadow game?"
"Phoebe";"I just asked you."
"Monica";"I just asked you."
"Phoebe";"I don’t have time for this."
"Monica";"No, that is what the game is."
"Phoebe";"Which you just gave up really quickly."
"Chandler";"(entering) Have you seen Joey?"
"Monica";"What’s the matter?"

"Girl";"That’s my job!"
"Frank";"So wait, what’s the deal here, I can have sex with you, but Ican’t touch you?"

"Girl";"What’d you think I was, a hooker?"
"Frank";"No, your a masseuse, it’s cool, I’m not a cop."
"Phoebe";"Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for likefive minutes."

"Phoebe";"Whatever, it’s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways."
"Frank";"Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can’t believe thatI screwed it up so bad."
"Phoebe";"You really thought it was perfect?"
"Frank";"Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn’t perfect, but y'know it was prettycool, y'know, ‘cause we had all those great talks y'know."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?"
"Frank";"Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about mylikes and my dislikes..."
"Phoebe";"I don’t...."
"Frank";"How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn’tmelt."
"Phoebe";"Right, okay, um-mm."
"Frank";"Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you ‘cause y'knowyou’re my sister, y'know."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I guess I do, yeah."

"Phoebe";"Well, I-I wasn’t hopping mad, y'know."
"Frank";"You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry."
"Phoebe";"Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now,this."

"Phoebe";"She wasn’t a hooker."
"Frank";"Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be."
"Chandler";"Okay, on three. One....Two...."
"Joey";"Why don’t we just go on two."
"Chandler";"Why two?"
"Joey";"Because it’s faster."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this‘two’ talk."
"Rachel";"Oh!"
"Joey";"All right, but in the future..."
"Ross";"Okay!! Okay!!"
"Rachel";"Come on!"
"Ross";"Heavy thing, not getting lighter!"
"Chandler";"Okay, one...two..."
"Joey";"So we are going on two?"
"All";"All right!! (they lift it into place, however there is one small problem,the unit is so long that it blocks some of both of their bedroom doors.)"
"Chandler";"Oh, good job Joe."
"Joey";"Wow, it’s big!"
"Chandler";"Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!"
"Joey";"Maybe, my ruler’s wrong."
"Phoebe";"Maybe all the rulers are wrong."
"Joey";"Look it’s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, alittle of my door."
"Chandler";"Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how ‘bout it blocksnone of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and moveit, but it doesn’t move.)"
"Joey";"Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet."
"Rachel";"Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf,double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guynods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak."
"Isabella";"(to Gunther) Um, coffee to go, please."
"Ross";"Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)"
"Monica";"Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God."
"Ross";"Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list."
"Monica";"Why? ‘Cause otherwise you’d go for it?"
"Ross";"Yeah, maybe."
"Rachel";"Oh-oh, you lie."
"Ross";"What you don’t think I’d go up to her?"
"Rachel";"Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me."
"Ross";"Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated."
"Rachel";"You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate."
"Ross";"Okay, hold my crawler."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Monica";"Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?"
"Rachel";"Honey, he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m justsorry we don’t got popcorn."
"Ross";"(to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I’m Ross, you don’t know me, but I’ma big, big fan of yours. I mean,"
"Isabella";"Aren’t you with that girl over there? (points at Rachel, whowaves back)"
"Ross";"Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding,um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I’m allowedto sleep with you. No, no, no, it’s flattery."
"Isabella";"I’m sorry. (starts to leave)"
"Ross";"Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don’t, don’t just dismissthis so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity..."
"Isabella";"Yeah, for you. Is that the list?"
"Ross";"Um, yeah."
"Isabella";"May I see it?"
"Ross";"Um, no."
"Isabella";"Come on! (grabs the list)"
"Ross";"But, okay."
"Isabella";"(reading it) I’m not on the list!"
"Ross";"Um, see, but that’s not the final draft."
"Isabella";"It’s laminated!"
"Ross";"Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler(Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumpedyou for Wynona Rider, local."
"Isabella";"Y'know it’s ironic..."
"Ross";"What?"
"Isabella";"...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterdayI bumped you for that guy over there. (points at a guy and leaves)"
"Ross";"(to the rest of the gang) We’re just gonna be friends."
"Joey";"Y'know what?"
"Chandler";"Umm?"
"Joey";"I bet ‘ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)"
"Chandler";"I’ve got five bucks says you can’t."
"Joey";"Get out your checkbook, mister."
"Chandler";"Oh, I think I have the cash."
"Joey";"You are dogged man! I totally fit!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles sothat the doors won’t open) I’m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crackbetween the door and frame) Here you go."
"Joey";"Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr.Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinksare on me!"
"Janice";"Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six ofyou?"
"Phoebe";"Wow, it’s like a dirty math problem."
"Ross";"I’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us."
"Janice";"Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid."
"Joey";"Well, that’s really a different question."
"Janice";"I’m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people whospends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies."
"Joey";"Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together."
"Monica and Rachel";"What?!!"
"Rachel";"Excuse me, there was no time!"
"Joey";"Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go?"
"Janice";"Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?"
"Rachel";"Does anybody need more coffee?"
"Ross";"Yeah, I’ll take some."
"Joey";"Hey, there’s a dog out there!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, that is so unfortunate."
"Ross";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight."
"Monica";"(entering from bedroom) Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh,Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone."
"Phoebe";"You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone."
"Monica";"Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye. (leaves)"
"Phoebe";"(angrily) Bye-bye! (to Ross) That’s why I moved out."
"Ross";"Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sisterthat you don’t live here anymore."
"Phoebe";"I think on some levels she already knows."
"Ross";"Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, shedoesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know thatyou’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now."
"Phoebe";"Okay, well maybe not on those levels."
"Chandler";"(entering, with a goatee) Hey."
"Ross";"Hey."
"Chandler";"I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever."
"Phoebe";"Why, nobody good?"
"Chandler";"Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’splural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the needto make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing"
"Ross";"So how many more do you have tomorrow?"
"Chandler";"Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy,who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’"
"Monica";"(entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on thefloor or come over no more!"

"Ross";"Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn’t really have anyclose friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susansomething, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it’s gonna make a difference"
"Chandler";"Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?"
"Eric";"Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hopethat’s cool."
"Chandler";"Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never."
"Eric";"Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister’sbeach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tellyou, she’s a porn star. (Chandler breaks his pencil in half)"
"Chandler";"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unlessit turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good. (Eric offersto shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)"

"Chandler";"Um-mm, yeah right!"
"Monica";"He’s so cute."
"Chandler";"Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk aroundwith and be referred to as the funny one."
"Monica";"Oh look, the pool table’s free. Rack ‘em up. I’ll be backin just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt."
"Chandler";"Okay, but after that, we’re shootin’ some pool."

"Rachel";"Yeah, I know."
"Friend No. 1";"What?"
"Rachel";"Oh, I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry forthe rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling,y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)"
"Friend No. 1";"Rachel stop!"
"Friend No. 2";"You’re so bad!"
"Rachel";"I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to havesome...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see."

"Phoebe";"(to Monica, who’s entering) Hey, you’re early."
"Monica";"What are you doing with the lamp?"
"Phoebe";"I’m just taking it to be re-wired."
"Monica";"Oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo,‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week."
"Phoebe";"No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here."
"Mr. Heckles";"You’re disturbing my oboe practice."
"Phoebe";"You don’t play the oboe!"
"Mr. Heckles";"I could play the oboe!"

"Eric";"Hi, I’m Eric, I’m gonna be Chandler’s new roommate."
"Mr. Heckles";"I’m Chandler’s new roommate."
"Eric";"I-I-I don’t think so."
"Mr. Heckles";"I could be Chandler’s new roommate."
"Eric";"But, he told me over the phone."
"Mr. Heckles";"He told me in person."
"Eric";"That’s weird."

"Joey";"Oh, no thanks, I got it. (picks it up) No I don’t!"
"Monica";"Whoa! Are you okay?"
"Joey";"Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush."
"Monica";"It’s the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away)And-and the humidity."
"Joey";"That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination."
"Monica";"Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?"
"Joey";"Like you wouldn’t believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This isa great place."
"Monica";"Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable."
"Joey";"Gotcha."
"Monica";"This place is really my Grandmother’s. (Joey starts to take off allof his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from herwhen she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if thelandlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are youthirsty?"
"Joey";"Oh, you bet I am!"
"Monica";"(turning around) Okay, here’s your penis!"
"Monica";"Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!"
"Joey";"You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?"
"Monica";"So?!"
"Joey";"Whoa, ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?"
"Monica";"Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!"
"Joey";"Oh right, right."
"Monica";"I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and toyou that means they wanna have sex?"
"Joey";"Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk."
"Monica";"It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know,but... By the way I can still see it."
"Monica";"Pheebs?"
"Phoebe";"Huh?"
"Monica";"Where’s your bed?"
"Phoebe";"It’s not in the apartment? (Monica gives a ‘Come on’look) Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again."
"Monica";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I’ve, I don’t live hereanymore."
"Monica";"What are you talking about?"
"Phoebe";"I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’tknow how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!"
"Monica";"Everybody knows!"
"Phoebe";"That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica,I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I gotlike a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions."
"Monica";"Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the otherside."
"Monica";"What?!?!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in aland where people can spill."
"Monica";"You can spill. In the sink."
"Phoebe";"Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and Ilove you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see thathappening."
"Monica";"I love you, too."
"Phoebe";"Aww, good. (they hug) What?"
"Monica";"What? I’m just said."
"Phoebe";"No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is."
"Chandler";"So ah, whatcha watching?"
"Chandler";"What’s it about?"
"Joey";"Lifeguards."
"Chandler";"Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Who’s she?"
"Joey";"Nicole Eggert. You'll like her."
"Chandler";"Wow! Look at them run."
"Joey";"They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I’ll go get one."
"Joey";"No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here."
"Chandler";"Well, hello!"
"Monica";"Hey."
"Chandler";"Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers."
"Monica";"(all depressed) Help yourself."
"Chandler";"You okay?"
"Monica";"Phoebe moved out."
"Chandler";"Right."
"Monica";"I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why Idon’t have a boyfriend?"
"Chandler";"Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, Idon’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend."
"Monica";"Well, I think so."
"Chandler";"Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of myfavourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life."
"Ross";"(all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what iswrong?"
"Ross";"My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over."
"Phoebe";"Oh no! Why?"
"Ross";"‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and I’mnot one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny."
"Ross";"(sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, manydrinks) I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out andshe’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know lookat her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool!"
"Phoebe";"Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?"
"Ross";"Well, now I do!!"
"Phoebe";"I’m sorry."
"Ross";"Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s theonly woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever...."
"Phoebe";"Aw, God Ross. Oh.(goes over and hugs him)"
"Chandler";"Umm, this is nice."
"Monica";"I know, it is isn’t it?"
"Chandler";"No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?"
"Monica";"Yeah! And I got it on sale, too."
"Chandler";"Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantlea nuclear device."
"Monica";"Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can."
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen,it’s, it’s gonna be...."
"Monica";"I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)"
"Ross";"Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, orI’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!"
"Phoebe";"I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross.You’re, you’re really, you’re so good. (kisses him on the cheek)"

"Phoebe";"What?"
"Ross";"My foot is stuck in the pocket."
"Phoebe";"What?"
"Ross";"No, I can’t get it out."
"Phoebe";"Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear."
"Ross";"No, come on don’t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!"
"Phoebe";"What?"
"Ross";"Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)"
"Ross";"Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution."
"Phoebe";"You have chalk on your face."
"Ross";"Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought thiswas real grass."
"Monica";"Hey, are you okay?"
"Ross";"My wife’s a lesbian."
"Joey";"Cool!!"
"Ross";"Hi."
"Chandler";"I can’t believe you came back."
"Rachel";"Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wannathink. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now."
"Friend No. 2";"Rachel! Rachel! (stirs Rachel from her dream, she’s in hercar driving back from the city)"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Friend No. 2";"You missed the exit!"
"Rachel";"Oh, sorry."

"Rachel";"Um, (shyly) Barry."
"Her Friends";"Awwww!!"

"Monica";"I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares aboutthe divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And I’mappalled for you by the way."
"Matress King";"(on TV)"

"Ross";"Come on! That’s great."
"All";"Wow!"
"Joey";"Yeah, yeah. It’s like my chance to give something back to the actingcommunity."
"Ross";"Y’know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students."
"Joey";"(glares at him) I know!"
"Phoebe";"Ugh! I don’t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean ifyou buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler."
"Monica";"Not at these prices."
"Phoebe";"(sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know inEngland this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, andshe makes the ‘that went right over your head’ motion) Woo!"

"Joey";"Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, so please, please, please, don’t say anything to Chandler."
"Joey";"You want me to lie to Chandler?"
"Phoebe";"Is that a problem?"
"Joey";"No."
"Phoebe";"Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let’s see what you got. All right ya,put ‘em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)"
"Joey";"Hey, you’re ah, pretty good at this."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the youngmen weren’t acting Christian enough."
"Joey";"Ahh!"
"Joey";"Hey now!"
"Joey";"Hey!!! Oww!! And I’m bleeding."

"Phoebe";"All right, I have ya. Oh God."
"Guy";"Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, it’s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay."
"Guy";"Gotcha. (he and his helper walk in carrying the racecar bed.)"
"Rachel";"Hi Daddy!"
"Dr. Green";"This where they put it? What, there no table available in thekitchen! Hello, baby."
"Rachel";"You remember Ross."
"Dr. Green";"Um-hmm."
"Ross";"Nice to see you again Dr. Green."
"Dr. Green";"So! (they both try to sit next to Rachel but Dr. Green issuccessful.) (to Ross) How’s the library?"
"Ross";"Ugh, museum."
"Dr. Green";"What happened to the library?"
"Ross";"There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah,I never worked at one."
"Dr. Green";"You know what’s really good here, the lobster. What do you sayshall I just order three."
"Ross";"Yeah, if you’re really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was ajoke, I made a joke."
"Rachel";"Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster."
"Dr. Green";"What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind ofperson that works at a library."
"Ross";"It’s not a library..."
"Dr. Green";"(interrupting him) I know!! It’s a museum! What, you’re theonly one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we willhave two lobsters and a menu. (nods at Ross, and mouths I don’t know to the waiter.)"
"Ross";"So, Dr. Green, how’s the old boat."
"Dr. Green";"They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?"
"Ross";"It gives it a nice antiquey look."
"Dr. Green";"(he stares at Ross) Rust, is boat cancer, Ross."
"Ross";"Wow. I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachelgiggles at that)"
"Dr. Green";"Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night tothe Levines, before we go."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Ross";"Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)"
"Rachel";"Aw honey stop! It’s not that bad."
"Ross";"Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve addedwrong. He only tipped like four percent."
"Rachel";"Yeah. That’s Daddy."
"Ross";"That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re awaitress."
"Rachel";"Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffeehouse, I’d be serving him sneezers."
"Ross";"So?"
"Rachel";"So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s notgonna change."
"Ross";"You really serve people sneezers?"
"Rachel";"Well um,"
"Dr Green";"You kids ready?"
"Ross";"Thanks again, Dr. Green."
"Dr. Green";"All right."
"Dr. Green";"Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt."
"Ross";"Oh, ah, you don’t need that."
"Dr. Green";"Why not?"
"Ross";"The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes,the, the ah, night blindness."
"Dr. Green";"(gets his receipt and notices the twenty) What is this? Who put atwenty down here? Huh?"
"Ross";"Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way toomuch, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really."
"Rachel";"Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do somethingabout that."
"Ross";"I know."
"Dr. Green";"Excuse me, you think I’m cheap?"
"Rachel";"Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he reallydidn’t."
"Ross";"Nothing I do means anything, really."
"Dr. Green";"This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put downtwenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot?Here, I’ll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. (rips upthe bill, and throws it at Ross, then leaves)"
"Ross";"Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’."
"Joey";"Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry asan actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take apair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey thatI’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in myeyebrow and I like it’ (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretendfishhook.) Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is tryand divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that’s how it’s done. Great soapopera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed."
"Student";"Hey, Mr. Trib."
"Joey";"Hey-hey."
"Student";"Guess what, I got an audition!"
"Joey";"Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud."
"Student";"I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?"
"Joey";"You bet! What’s the part?"
"Student";"Oh it’s great, it’s a role on"
"Rachel";"You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave italone."
"Ross";"Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in myfood."
"Rachel";"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans andrubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already."
"Ross";"Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall."

"Rachel";"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’swhy you have got to be the bigger man here."
"Ross";"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, Icould be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, exceptthat I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’"
"Rachel";"Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? Forme?"
"Ross";"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okaywe’re never gonna get along."
"Rachel";"Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got aMother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wannahave to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)"

"Phoebe";"I know, you must’ve won like a contest or something!"
"Monica";"Phoebe!"
"Monica";"Why is this car in my bedroom?"
"Phoebe";"I’m sorry, okay, I-I wasn’t looking, and the store says thatthey won’t take it back because you signed for it..."
"Monica";"When did I sign for it?"
"Phoebe";"When I was you! Y'know what, it’s all Joey’s fault,‘cause he left his nose open!"
"Monica";"Did you make brownies today?"
"Chandler";"Knock, knock."
"Monica";"(to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed."
"Chandler";"Hey, I’m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees thebed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp."

"Chandler";"Okay. (to Monica) It’s a racecar."
"Phoebe";"So. This has always been Monica’s bed, what you’re justnoticing now, how self-involved are you?"
"Chandler";"Okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic onthe mattress?"
"Monica";"Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offersher, her hand to comfort her.)"
"Student";"Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas,that’s not gonna be me, not me."
"Joey";"Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?"

"Chandler";"You totally screwed him over."
"Monica";"Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?"
"Joey";"Because, Monica, the guy’s so good, and I really, really want thispart."

"Rachel";"He’s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to mychiropractor..."
"Dr. Green";"You’re still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn’tget into medical school in Extapa!"
"Ross";"Thank you! That’s what I keep saying."

"Rachel";"It’s Robert Bobby."
"Dr. Green";"Oh."
"Rachel";"And um, excuse me, he helps me."
"Ross";"Oh-ho please. Ask her how?"
"Dr. Green";"What do you need help for?"
"Rachel";"With my alignment. I’ve got one leg shorter than the other."
"Dr. Green";"Oh God!"
"Ross";"Argue with that."
"Rachel";"What? It’s true, my right leg is two inches shorter."
"Dr. Green";"Come on! You’re just titling! (to Ross) Her legs are fine!"
"Ross";"I know that!"
"Dr. Green";"So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?"
"Rachel";"I’m sorry, let her?"
"Ross";"What can I do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insuranceeither."
"Dr. Green";"Wait a minute, you don’t have renter’s insurance?!"
"Rachel";"No."
"Dr. Green";"Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run afterhim with one leg shorter than the other?!"
"Ross";"Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?"
"Dr. Green";"I’d love some juice. Thanks."
"Ross";"Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?"
"Rachel";"Yeah honey, I’m standing right there! Why didn’t you just tellhim about the mole I haven’t got checked yet."
"Ross";"Excellent!"
"Joey";"(sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you’llhave a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in therecent, present. And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor toplay a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turnedout, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he’s got a twoyear contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, meI’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be onTV. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause fromhis students.) Thank you."
"Jester";"Uh, may I help you?"
"Monica";"Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuckwith the racecar bed."
"Jester";"Look, it’s like I told you, there’s nothing I can do. Yousigned for it, Monica Velula Geller."
"Joey";"All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king."
"Jester";"Nobody sees the king!"
"Joey";"Oh-ho-kay, I’m talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)"
"Jester";"Hey! You can’t go back there!"
"Janice";"Oh my God."
"Chandler";"Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screechingsound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin’! (honks thebed’s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops)All right, I’ll leave. My bed’s so boring."
"Rachel";"Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?"
"Chandler";"I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)"
"Chandler";"Okay, I’m not gonna have one."
"Ross";"Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)"
"Phoebe";"No, no, it’s just my tooth."
"Chandler";"All right I’ll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)"
"Ross";"So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one."
"Phoebe";"No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him."
"Chandler";"See that is the problem with invisible dentists."
"Ross";"Why? Why can’t you go to him?"
"Phoebe";"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies."
"Chandler";"That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look downthe hygienist’s blouse."
"Rachel";"Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John,my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’."
"Rachel";"And all these people actually died?"
"Phoebe";"Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good care ofmy teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!"
"Ross";"Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happenedto die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, acoincidence."
"Phoebe";"Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead."
"Ross";"Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and Rachel comes upand kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther) Umm, can I get a napkin too?"
"Gunther";"Oh, like you don’t already have everything."
"Phoebe";"(trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)"
"Rachel";"Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go."
"Phoebe";"All right, fine, fine, but if you’re my next victim, don’tcome back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set."
"Rachel";"I promise."
"Phoebe";"Although, don’t feel like you can’t visit."
"Joey";"(entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?"
"Ross";"(patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no he’snot."
"Monica";"You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband."
"Ross";"What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you goingto tell Chandler?"
"Joey";"Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, tonot."
"Rachel";"Joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this, youhave to tell him."
"Joey";"It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him."
"Phoebe";"Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe"
"Joey";"(looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock.It’s like a"

"Joey";"What did they do?"
"Ross";"Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, thenthey rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that."
"Monica";"So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?"
"Ross";"Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you."
"Rachel";"Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?"
"Ross";"You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica mouths‘Don’t worry, I’ll be here the whole time.’ to Ross.) Yes! That’dbe great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. (Monicasarcastically mouths ‘Yeah!’ and holds up her thumb.)"
"Joey";"Hey-hey, Ross?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Joey";"I’ve got a science question."
"Ross";"Hmm?"
"Joey";"If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact ‘Homo-sapien’, is that whythere extinct?"
"Ross";"Joey, Homo Sapiens are people."
"Joey";"Hey-hey, I’m not judging."
"Rachel";"(holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon. (moves it back and forth) Spoon. Comeon! All right, y'know what I think he’s bored."

"Rachel";"We’re not?!"
"Monica";"No we’re not."
"Rachel";"All right, I like that."
"Monica";"Okay."
"Rachel";"So we’re okay, we’re okay, we’re okay, (starts to examBen) aren’t we? No, we’re not okay, we’re not okay, there’s a bump,there’s a bump."

"Rachel";"I cannot push it in!"
"Monica";"Okay, we’re gonna need a distraction."
"Rachel";"Okay, okay, okay."
"Monica";"I got it!"

"Monica";"Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?"
"Rachel";"Oh, oh, oh, I’ll get ‘Rainy Day Bear’!! (runs to get him)"

"Rachel";"Oh God, oh God, it’s sowed on though."
"Monica";"Give it. Give it."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Monica and Rachel";"Oh!!"
"Rachel";"Oh, it’s just like a bloodbath in here today."
"Chandler";"Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls arenice?"

"Chandler";"What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joeyquickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?"
"Joey";"They have a kid together, y'know. They’re like, they’re like afamily, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that work, I know Iwouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wannaah, come poke a nude guy?"
"Ross";"Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?"
"Rachel";"Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean, nooffense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child."
"Ross";"It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time,y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could."
"Rachel";"(confidently) I did!"
"Ross";"I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time."
"Rachel";"I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head againstthat thing!"
"Ross";"Monica did it?"
"Ross";"Monica?"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?"
"Monica";"No. Why?"
"Ross";"Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabetsong, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head."
"Monica";"Really?!"
"Ross";"Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his leftleg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort ofy'know... (walks around in a circle)"
"Monica";"Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)"
"Rachel";"I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell."
"Monica";"(coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!(starts to chase Ross around the living room)"
"Ross";"Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!"
"Rachel";"I’ll get the hat."
"Chandler";"Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let meget through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy."
"Janice";"Okay."
"Chandler";"I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guythat breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you arethe reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matterhow nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad."
"Janice";"Wow!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do."
"Janice";"Oh! You’re right. Oh God. But, before I can say‘good-bye’, there’s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The wayI feel about you, it’s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie’s beensinging about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it’s like movie love, you’re mysoulmate, and I can’t believe we’re not going to be spending the rest of ourlives together."
"Chandler";"Then don’t leave me!"
"Janice";"What?"
"Chandler";"Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!"
"Janice";"No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I’ve got to give mymarriage another chance."
"Chandler";"No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorceanother chance."
"Janice";"(standing up) I’m sorry. (hugs him)"
"Chandler";"Ohhh. Don’t go."
"Janice";"No, I-I-I gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but Chandler doesn’tlet her go.)"
"Chandler";"No. No! No! No!"
"Janice";"Honey, honey, people are looking."
"Chandler";"I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) Idon’t care!!"
"Janice";"Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now. (tries to get her leg out ofChandler’s grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off her shoe.)"
"Chandler";"You can’t leave! I have your shoe!"
"Janice";"Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)"
"Gunther";"Rachel has those in burgendy."
"Joey";"All right now remember, something this big and long is going to bedifficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area."
"Ross";"Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!"
"Phoebe";"I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is adead fat guy on a stick."
"Joey";"All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke. (they start to advancethe giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle.Okay, okay, we’re approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to theirview of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread theneedle."
"Phoebe";"He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!"
"Monica";"And yet, we’re still poking him."
"Joey";"Okay, retract the device, retract the device."
"Ross";"He does not look happy."
"Rachel";"Hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device."
"Joey";"Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!"
"Chandler";"(singing)"
"Phoebe";"(joining him)"
"Chandler";"(high pitched)"
"The Guys";"(reacting to a play) Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!"
"Phoebe";"Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watchingfootball, you could help."
"The Guys";"We will. (they don’t move)"
"Monica";"Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles."
"Rachel";"No Mon,"
"Monica";"Every year."
"Phoebe";"Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of thesethings. (just as she sits down)."
"Ross";"Halftime."
"Joey";"Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a littlethree on three going?"
"Rachel";"Oh! That would be sooo much fun!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever."
"Joey";"Great, you can cover Chandler."
"Chandler";"No, no, no, I don’t, I don’t really wanna play."
"Joey";"Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up."
"Chandler";"That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanutclusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that Idon’t have goals!"
"Joey";"Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, youget some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’tplay, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on."
"Chandler";"Yeah, all right, I’ll play."
"Phoebe";"Yay!!"
"Rachel";"Let’s do it! Ross?"
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"Do you wanna play football?"
"Ross";"Um, Monica and I aren’t supposed to play football."
"Joey";"Says who? Your mom?"
"Monica and Ross";"Yeah."
"Monica";"Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch footballgame called the ‘Geller Bowl.’"
"Chandler";"No, no, no, you say that proudly."
"Monica";"Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind’vecompetitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross’s nose."
"Ross";"It was soo"
"Monica";"To score the winning touchdown, by the way."
"Ross";"Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdowndidn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nosebreaking."
"Monica";"(to Chandler and Joey) I won the game."
"Ross";"Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?"
"Rachel";"Um, there was a Geller Cup?"
"Ross";"Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said,‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophyand.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw itin the lake."
"Chandler";"And was the curse lifted?"
"Ross";"Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football everagain."
"Monica";"Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it’sbeen twelve years."
"Ross";"Can I see you for a second?"
"Monica";"(shouting) Once!!"
"Ross";"All right, we’re gonna play."
"Chandler";"But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, becausemy Mom won’t let me cross the street."
"Monica";"Okay. Let’s bring it in."
"Rachel";"Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me."
"Ross";"Here you go. (throws her the ball)"
"Rachel";"(knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in theface."
"Joey";"All right, we have to pick captains."
"Chandler";"And then Tineals."
"Phoebe";"Okay, so how do we decide that?"
"Monica";"Well, why don’t we just bunny up."
"Rachel, Chandler, and Joey";"What?"
"Monica and Ross";"(holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbitears with their fingers.) Bunny!"
"Monica";"Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied firstso that means I get to pick first. Joey."
"Joey";"Thank you."
"Rachel";"Monica, I’m your best friend."
"Ross";"Sweetie, don’t worry you’ll get picked. Chandler."

"Ross";"Come on, let’s go!"
"Monica";"Losers walk!"

"Chandler";"Well, that went well."
"Joey";"I think so."
"Chandler";"Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number."
"Joey";"Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for itmyself, y'know."
"Chandler";"Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part ofthat whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about."
"Joey";"Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I’ll let you haveher."

"Ross";"Okay. Hut! Hike!"
"Joey";"Fumble!"
"Joey";"What the hell’s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey."
"Chandler";"Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math."
"Joey";"All right, that’s it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. Butnow, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself."
"Chandler";"Hey! Well, I’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Orsomething about you that’s mean!"
"Monica";"All right, come on guys, let’s go! Tie score, and we’rerunnin’ out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monicathrows the ball to Phoebe.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh I got it!! (catches the ball) Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!"
"Joey";"Pheebs, run!"
"Monica";"Run, Phoebe, run!"
"Phoebe";"Touchdown!! Touchdown!!"
"Ross";"Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn’t count."
"Monica";"After the snap!"
"Ross";"Before the snap!"
"Joey";"After!!"
"Chandler";"Before!!"
"Rachel";"Now, does it really matter?"
"All";"Yes!!"
"Phoebe";"Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?"
"Ross";"Oh Pheebs, that’s great. It doesn’t count."
"Monica";"Does so count!"
"Ross";"Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God!"
"Monica";"Y'know what, that’s fine, maybe you haven’t grown up, but Ihave."
"Ross";"Oh-ho, okay."
"Monica";"Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)"
"Ross";"Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, goahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win."
"Phoebe";"Woo-yay!!"
"Monica";"No! Listen, I’m not gonna go through this with you again, okay.Just once I wanna beat when you can’t blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or thefact that you thought you were getting mono. Let’s just call this, tie score andit’s halftime."
"Ross";"Okay, first of all, I don’t play with cheaters, and second of all,you know I had swollen glands!!"
"Monica";"Y'know what? I’ll think you’ll play."
"Ross";"Oh really! Why is that?"
"Monica";"Because the winner gets this!"
"Ross";"The Geller Cup."
"Chandler";"Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?"
"All";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"Okay, good."
"Ross";"Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!"
"Monica";"When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, Iswam into the lake and fished it out."
"Ross";"That cup is mine!"
"Monica";"No it’s not! You want it, you’re gonna have to win it!"
"Rachel";"All right, so are we not having dinner at all?"
"Monica";"Come on Phoebe, let’s go! Come on, it’s time to get serious,huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game."
"Joey";"It’s hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl."
"Monica";"All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be ableto focus?"
"Joey";"What are you gonna do?"
"Monica";"All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I’lltake care of the rest."
"Joey";"Okay."
"Monica";"Break!"
"Joey";"Here you go!"
"Ross";"Chandler! Chandler!"
"Chandler";"(to Margha) Hi."
"Monica";"Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don’t see that everyday, doya?"
"Ross";"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s with the tackling?"
"Monica";"What?! I just touched him and he went over."
"Ross";"Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough."
"Phoebe";"I love this game!!"
"Ross";"Hey, where’d you get that?"
"Rachel";"I went really long."
"Monica";"Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!"
"Ross";"It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pickfirst, so you got the better team."
"Monica";"You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’rewinning because I’m better than you."
"Monica";"Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I’llprove it to you, okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I’ll still win thegame."
"Ross";"What?! The guys against the girls? See, that’s ridiculous Monica,because I’m only down by three touchdowns."
"Monica";"Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose toa bunch of girls."
"Ross";"Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you’re with me."
"Rachel";"I can not believe your trading me!!"
"Monica";"Come on Rach, come on. Let’s see what’s it like to be on awinning team for a change."
"Rachel";"Are you gonna let me play?"
"Monica";"All right then."
"Margha";"(coming over) The game is over, we eat now?"
"Chandler";"No-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we’re just switchingteams."
"Joey";"Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it’s better if we’reon the same team."
"Ross";"Right. Okay, let’s play. Let’s go."
"Chandler";"No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?"
"Joey";"Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania."
"Chandler";"And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near theNetherlands, right?"
"Joey";"Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place wherePeter Pan and Tinker Bell come from."
"Margha";"Oh, my."
"Ross";"Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let’s play some ball,guys."
"Joey";"Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I’m not playing with this guy, now."
"Chandler";"Fine with me."
"Ross";"Okay, y'know what, let’s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi,which of my boys do you like?"
"Chandler and Joey";"What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?"
"Margha";"Which do I like?"
"Ross";"Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to yourwindmill..."
"Margha";"Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird,I would have to say, Chandler."
"Chandler";"Yes!!"
"Joey";"Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn’t understand thequestion."
"Chandler";"Well, you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her."
"Margha";"I’m sorry, Joey, that is my chose."
"Chandler";"You hear that! That is her chose, mister I’ll let you have her! Iwin! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)"
"Margha";"I’m now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one."
"Chandler";"Wh-what?"
"Margha";"I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye."
"Joey";"Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex."
"Chandler";"Y'know what, it doesn’t matter, ‘cause she picked me. Me!From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching"
"Ross";"Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have notime, and we are losing, we are losing to girls."
"Chandler";"We’re not gonna lose to girls."
"Ross";"Hey! It’s 42-21!"
"Joey";"This sucks, I was just up by that much!"
"Monica";"Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries."
"Monica";"We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, justthink about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV whileyou’re making out..."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!"
"Monica";"Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let’s kill‘um!"
"Rachel";"Yeah!!! Kill ‘um!!!"
"Phoebe";"All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know howare we gonna beat three boys?"
"Monica";"All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we’re downby two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing aslow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long."
"Rachel";"No! Come on! Don’t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me."
"Monica";"Honey, there’s a reason."
"Rachel";"God, I’m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would youlet me throw, come on this is my game too."
"Phoebe";"Come on Mon, let her throw the ball."
"Monica";"All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I’ll pitch it to you, you throwit down field to Phoebe. All right. Break."
"Rachel";"Thank you! Break!"
"Monica";"Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!"
"The Guys";"One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!"
"Rachel";"I’m so sorry! Are you okay?"
"Monica";"No! I’m not okay!"
"Rachel";"I’m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn’t knowwhat to do."
"Joey";"(looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!"
"Chandler";"Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!"
"Monica";"Come on! Come on! Hurry! We’re running out of time! Huddle up!"
"Phoebe";"Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah."
"Monica";"All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long."
"Rachel";"(on the verge of tears) Okay."
"Monica";"Break!"
"Rachel";"(in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!"
"Chandler";"Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts atthat pole, so you’re five feet short, so we win!"
"Phoebe";"Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobodytagged Rachel, then isn’t the play still going."
"Ross";"Let go! Let go!"
"Monica";"Let go! I’m a tiny little woman!!"
"Chandler";"Guys! Guys! Come on! It’s Thanksgiving, it’s not importantwho wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Notyou! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!"
"Monica";"Ow!!"
"Rachel";"We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there’s a likeleague we could join or something."
"Phoebe";"Isn’t there a national football league."
"Chandler";"Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights."
"Rachel";"Oh shoot! I work Monday nights."
"Phoebe";"Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?"
"Joey";"When they’re hungry enough, they’ll come in."
"Monica";"Let go!"
"Ross";"No! You let go!"
"Monica";"No!"
"Ross";"How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?"
"Monica";"I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough."
"Ross";"Hey! It’s starting to snow."
"Ross";"Gimme the this!"
"Monica";"Let go!"
"Chandler";"(reading the comics) Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Chandler";"Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should stillbe allowed to fly this thing?"
"Gunther";"Rachel?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Gunther";"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeksgetting trained by another waitress?"
"Rachel";"Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?"
"Gunther";"(laughs) Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the trainingagain, whenever."
"Rachel";"(to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?"
"Chandler";"(thinks about it) Yeah?"
"Sarah";"So that’s two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the BrownBirds of America, I salute you. (Does the Brown Bird salute, she blows on a bird call,then holds her hand, palm facing out, next to her face, and then waves it like a birdflapping it’s wings.)"
"Ross";"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand."
"Chandler";"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand."
"Ross";"Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand."
"Chandler";"I was shrieking... like a Marine."
"Ross";"All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championshipplay. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does abackswing and hits Sarah who’s started up the stairs, knocking her down, they bothwatch in horror.)"
"Monica";"You broke a little girl’s leg?!!"
"Ross";"I know. I feel horrible. Okay."
"Chandler";"(reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on"
"Ross";"Well, I’m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what doyou think she’ll like?"
"Monica";"Maybe a"
"Rachel";"I’m gonna get back to retraining. (gets up)"
"Ross";"All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)"
"Chandler";"Look out kids, he’s coming! (Ross continues to leave with hishead down in shame.)"
"Joey";"And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees."
"Phoebe";"Have fun. Oh wait, no, don’t! I forgot I am totally against thatnow."
"Joey";"What? Me having a job?"
"Phoebe";"No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, andtheir, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey,how do you sleep at night?"
"Joey";"Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey,Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, theirfulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy."
"Phoebe";"Really?"
"Chandler";"Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most ofthem, it’s the only chance to see New York."
"Gunther";"...and after you’ve delivered the drinks, you take the emptytray...."
"Rachel";"Gunther, Gunther, please, I’ve worked here for two and a halfyears, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)"
"Gunther";"What if you put them here. (sets the empty tray on another stack ofempty trays on the back counter.)"
"Rachel";"Huh. Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because thatway they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitressesdo that too."
"Gunther";"They already do. That’s why they call it the ‘trayspot.’"
"Rachel";"Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that itwas a club they went to. Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry. (walks away)"
"Gunther";"It’s all right. Sweetheart."
"Ross";"So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me thatyou get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell thosecookies anymore."
"Sarah";"Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the mostwins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a"
"Ross";"Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?"
"Sarah";"Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments,as I do daydreaming about outer space, he’d be able to afford a trip to the TajMahal."
"Ross";"I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all theway to India."
"Sarah";"No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he’sgonna double the college money my Grandma left me."
"Ross";"Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have tosell in order to win?"
"Sarah";"The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five."
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Sarah";"So far, I’ve sold seventy-five."
"Ross";"Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out hiswallet) How much are the boxes?"
"Sarah";"Five dollars a box."
"Ross";"(puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?"
"Sarah";"A ten speed bike. But, I’d rather have something my Dadcouldn’t sell."
"Ross";"Well, that makes sense."
"Sarah";"Could you do me one favor, if it’s not too much trouble?"
"Ross";"Yeah, Sarah, anything."
"Sarah";"Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the spaceshuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don’t have a TV, the lady across thealley said she’d push hers up to a window, so I could watch it."
"Woman";"(looking through her peephole, we see Ross standing in the hallway.)Yesss?"
"Ross";"Hi, I’m selling Brown Bird cookies."
"Woman";"You’re no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole."
"Ross";"No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Birdsalute.)"
"Woman";"What does that mean?"
"Ross";"Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited tosleep-overs."
"Woman";"I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!"
"Ross";"No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to goto Spacecamp more than anything in the world."
"Woman";"I’m pressing, a policeman is on his way."
"Ross";"Okay, okay! I’m going. I’m going. (goes across the hall to knockon another door.)"
"Woman";"I can still see you!"
"Ross";"All right!!"
"Phoebe";"(walking up to Joey) Hey."
"Joey";"Hey. What, what are you doing here?"
"Phoebe";"Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh,all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh..."
"Joey";"Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas...."
"Phoebe";"Destiny."
"Joey";"Sure."
"Phoebe";"Yes."
"Joey";"All right."
"Phoebe";"Okay. (One of Joey’s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes!That one doesn’t look very fulfilled."
"Joey";"Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s justtaking it to the back."
"Phoebe";"You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist."
"Joey";"Well we have to make room for the fresh ones."
"Phoebe";"So, what happens to the old guys?"
"Joey";"Well, they go into the chipper."
"Phoebe";"Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds? (Joeypoints out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to playin the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face againstJoey’s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)"
"Joey";"(to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the ‘cutit’ motion with his hands)"
"Ross";"...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters,Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus."
"Joey";"All right, I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus’s."
"Ross";"Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl toSpacecamp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?"
"Chandler";"Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?"
"Ross";"No, but ah, there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell youwhat, I’ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night."
"Ross";"Mon?"
"Monica";"All right, I’ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, andthat’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross)Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?"
"Ross";"Ah, no Mon, Dad"
"Monica";"No."
"Ross";"Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em."

"Rachel";"Well, yeah! I’m still pursuing that."
"Chandler";"How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending outresumes like what, two years ago?"
"Rachel";"Well, I’m also sending out.... good thoughts."
"Joey";"If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you’ve got nothingpushing you to get another one. You need the fear."

"Gunther";"Rachel?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Gunther";"Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular."
"Rachel";"Can’t I just look at the handles on them?"
"Gunther";"You would think."
"Rachel";"Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you knowwhy I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. Idon’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where thetray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t thinkI should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice."
"Gunther";"What?!"

"Joey";"Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorizeit. Show to everybody. Got it?"
"Monica";"Um-mm."
"Joey";"All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at thecard before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks alittle while) 5 of hearts."
"Ross";"Real magic does exist."
"Rachel";"Wow."
"Monica";"Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?"
"Joey";"I can’t tell you that, no."
"Ross";"Ah, somebody’s at the door on the ceiling."
"Rachel";"Noo, that’s our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor."
"Monica";"He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything."
"Phoebe";"Why don’t you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly,please?’"
"Monica";"I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up thereto yell and then I end up apologizing to him."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I’ll go up there, I’ll tell himto keep it down."
"Monica";"All right, be my guest."
"Rachel";"Good luck."
"Joey";"All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wannaknow how I did it, I’ll show ya.

"Monica";"Honey, what’s the matter?"
"Chandler";"I just saw Janice."
"All";"Oh."
"Chandler";"Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, shelooked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them."
"Joey";"Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we brokeup. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killedme."
"Chandler";"Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon."
"Joey";"Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know...."
"Ross";"Hey Chandler, there’s a party tomorrow, you’ll feel better then."
"Chandler";"Oh, y'know what, I’m gonna be okay, you don’t have to throwa party for me."
"Monica";"It’s Joey’s birthday."
"Chandler";"Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him."
"Monica";"Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there."

"Rachel";"Op."
"Mr. Kaplan";"Eh."
"Rachel";"Oh, you got me."

"Rachel";"Oh, that sounds great."
"Mr. Kaplan";"Come on over here, sweetheart. (they walk over to a storage closet)"
"Rachel";"Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much."

"Rachel";"Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it."
"Monica";"I know honey, I’m sorry."
"Rachel";"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I thinkwhy would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotelyrelated to the field they’re interested in."
"Monica";"(gives her a look) Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got aYentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!"
"Rachel";"Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t.... I don’t mindpaying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira,the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom."

"Monica";"That’s okay."
"Rachel";"That’s all right."
"Ross";"That’s okay."

"Chandler";"Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France.When actually I’ll be in Cuba."
"Ross";"All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay inperson. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela,okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let herdown easy."
"Chandler";"What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?"

"Joey";"She’s right in there. (motions to the living room)"
"Joey’s Sisters";"Hey, Chandler!"

"Ross";"Bummer."
"Rachel";"(to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy."
"Ross";"No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look,Rach, I want only good things for you."

"Joey";"What’s goin’ on?"
"Chandler";"(pats him on the shoulder) You’re it! Now run and hide!"
"Mary-Theresa";"It’s no big deal. Chandler was just kissin’ me becausehe thought I was Mary-Angela."
"Joey";"What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?"
"Chandler";"I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey’ssisters gasp) Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look reallysimilar."

"Chandler";"Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s notgoing to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?"
"Joey";"Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’dbe on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!"
"Chandler";"Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just wantyou to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my bestfriend. I would never do anything like this ever again."

"Joey";"No! No! No! No, I’m not going to punch Chandler."
"Cookie";"I’ll do it."
"Joey";"No you won’t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believehim, he’s sorry. But, (to Chandler) you’ve got one more apology to make, allright, you’ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela."
"Chandler";"Okay, absolutely!"
"Joey";"All right."
"Chandler";"You’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s, but hestill doesn’t know which one is Mary-Angela.)"
"Joey";"Cookie, now you can punch him!"

"Rachel";"Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he reallyhappens to like me."
"Ross";"Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?"
"Ross";"Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?"
"Joey";"All right, that’s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guyis going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel)But, is he a big guy?"

"Chandler";"Don’t worry."
"Phoebe";"God, I hope they kick his ass!"
"Rachel";"Honey, I’m sorry."
"Monica";"Y'know if it’s any consolation, he really did sound like he washaving more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)"
"Guy";"(muffled) May I help you?"
"Rachel";"(running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Doeseverybody hate these shoes?"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on thatas long as your wearing that towel dress."
"Rachel";"(to Ross) Tell him."
"Ross";"(to Chandler) It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed tostart with her!"
"Chandler";"All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?"
"Ross";"Why?"
"Chandler";"I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert,y'know he's the botanist."
"Ross";"Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks."
"Chandler";"Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?"
"Ross";"Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound)"
"Phoebe";"(entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach,I'm here with the purses!"

"Rachel";"(running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs."
"Phoebe";"Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles."
"Rachel";"No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today."
"Ross";"Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come downthere and I'll take you out to lunch?"
"Rachel";"Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out."
"Ross";"Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (toPhoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox?"
"Phoebe";"Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it."
"Rachel";"Oh."
"Chandler";"(to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday?"
"Ross";"What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?"
"Chandler";"Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about thebachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he cansee a stripper."
"Phoebe";"A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich�. Why don't you get amagician?!"
"Chandler";"Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then allright."
"Ross";"She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you shouldof seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, (to Joey) he's reallygood looking. (Joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) What am I gonna do?"

"Julio";"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"Monica";"You don't even know me..."
"Julio";"Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you."

"Rachel";"Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?"
"Ross";"Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now ifit's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm notgonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away."
"Gunther";"Let it be me! Let it be me!"
"Rachel";"Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two peoplelove each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (shekisses him)"

"Monica";"What?"
"Richard";"You’ve got panties stuck to your leg."
"Monica";"(removes them) That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things outof the dryer, and it’s static cling. Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’dbe running into you and saw an opportunity."
"Richard";"It’s good to see you."
"Monica";"It’s good to see you too."

"Chandler";"(to Ross) Wellll?"
"Ross";"Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
"Chandler";"What do we do? What do we do?"
"Ross";"Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it."
"Chandler";"Like an eclipse."

"Monica";"Yeah, I do think it’s better this way. (listens) Yeah, we’rebeing smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, I’m sure.(she opens the doorand it’s Richard)"
"Richard";"You really sure?"
"Monica";"I’ll call you back. (starts kissing him)"
"Monica";"So we can be friends who sleep together."
"Richard";"Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball."
"Monica";"Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do youcurrently have any other racquetball buddies?"
"Richard";"Just your dad. (pause) Although that’s actually racquetball. Youknow I-I do have a blind date with my sister’s neighbour next Tuesday."
"Monica";"Oh."
"Richard";"You want me to cancel it?"
"Monica";"No! (pushes him) No!"

"Joey";"All right I’ll talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when thekid sees those two blanks in the hallway?"
"Chandler";"Hmmm, that’s very cool."
"Joey";"Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no,no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second theyget away. Aww!"
"Rachel";"Joey! I can’t believe you just did that!"
"Chandler";"I can’t believe she cracked your code!"
"Rachel";"All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even thoughshe’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy."
"Joey";"Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys thehotel, and kills the dad."

"Rachel";"Um-hmm."
"Joey";"Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?"
"Chandler";"No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?"
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Ross";"Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’sever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?"
"Rachel";"No. She doesn’t die."
"Joey";"Then why would you say that?!"
"Rachel";"Because, I wanted to hurt you."
"Robert";"(running in) Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys."
"Rachel";"(gasps) Oh my...."
"Robert";"Got ‘em."
"Monica";"Hi."
"Rachel";"(screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. I’msorry."
"Monica";"You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to topit off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over herleft breast.) in a grill fire."
"Monica";"What are you smiling at?"
"Rachel";"I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up."
"Monica";"Yeah, right."
"Richard";"Hello."
"Monica";"I love this friend thing!"
"Phoebe";"Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you justtell him?"
"Ross";"Oh."
"Phoebe";"Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is iton the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’"
"Chandler";"We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely knowand talk about his.... stuff."
"Ross";"He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary. (Hestops and thinks about what he just said.)"
"Robert";"(entering) Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey."
"Robert";"(to Phoebe) So are ready for the gym? They’ve got this new rockclimbing wall, we can spot each other."

"Chandler";"Yeah, we got, um-hmm."
"Phoebe";"Umm, I think you’re really, really great..."
"Robert";"Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? (spreadshis legs) Is it something I’m putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?"
"Phoebe";"I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say."
"Gunther";"(cleaning up the table) (to Robert) Hey buddy, this is a family place,put the mouse back in the house."
"Monica";"Ow!"
"Richard";"(outside the bedroom) Really?! Well, it’s just like everyoneelse’s apartment. It’s got rooms, walls, and ceilings."
"Richard’s Date";"Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give methe tour."
"Monica";"Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom asRichard starts the tour.)"
"Richard";"Ah well, this is the living room."
"Richard’s Date";"Impressive."
"Richard";"All right. This is the kitchen."
"Richard’s Date";"Oh, that’s real pretty. Wait a minute, don’t Iget to see the bedroom?"
"Richard";"The bedroom. Well it’s pretty much your typical... (opens the dooras Monica hides under the covers, and quickly closes the door before his date can see theroom.) bedroom."
"Richard’s Date";"We’re still on this side of the door."
"Richard";"Um-hmm."
"Richard’s Date";"Yeah, but I didn’t get to see it."
"Richard";"Oh shoot! Maybe next time. (yawns) Thanks for a lovely evening. (showsher out)"
"Monica";"(still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?"
"Richard";"Oh, (laughs) that was the blind date that I told you about, she calledand switched it to today."
"Monica";"(still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And I’m justasking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this."
"Richard";"Well, you seem fine."
"Monica";"(gets up) Okay, y'know what, I’m not fine, I’m not. I mean howcan I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause)Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?"
"Richard";"You mean like exclusive friends?"
"Monica";"Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be soterrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stoodup in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever."
"Richard";"Wow. Y'know we’re back where we were. Honey, I would love to doall that, but nothing’s changed."
"Monica";"That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache."
"Richard";"Okay, okay, one thing’s changed. But we still want differentthings and we know how this is gonna end."
"Monica";"Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘causegetting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think Icould do it again."
"Richard";"I know I couldn’t. So...."
"Monica";"How ‘bout one last game of racquetball?"
"Monica";"Watch the thorns!"
"Richard";"(lying down) Ow!!"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Joey";"Beth is really, really sick."
"Rachel";"Awwww."
"Joey";"Jo’s there, but I don’t think there’s anything she coulddo."
"Rachel";"Joey?"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Do you want to put the book in the freezer?"
"Joey";"(nodding his head) Okay."
"Rachel";"Okay."

"Joey";"Wow! This girl is good."
"Phoebe";"Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of thatbefore."
"Chandler";"I like her."
"Phoebe";"(to Chandler) Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both atthe same time?"
"Chandler";"Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from thesepeople."

"Monica";"Yeah, sure."
"Gunther";"(to Chandler) Someone in there?"
"Chandler";"No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’"

"Joey";"All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had goneout a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me,her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romanticdinner...."
"Monica";"You gave her food poisoning!?"
"Joey";"I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front ofthe fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out.So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!"
"Joey";"I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told youabout Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg."
"Monica";"Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?"
"Joey";"I ran!!"
"Chandler";"Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’veever met in a men’s room."
"Ginger";"Actually, me too."
"Chandler";"(sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all ina puddle."
"Ginger";"Oh damn, I hate that."

"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Monica";"Okay, well I do know you."
"Phoebe";"That’s what I said."
"Monica";"Well so?"
"Phoebe";"I can’t. I can’t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted herand then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone. Y'know what the saddest partis, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in likeall my lives."
"Leslie";"(singing) My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down atthe heel, holes in the toes. Don’t care what people say. My feet’s best friends,pals to the end. With them I’m one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light,I...."

"Leslie";"What? Why not? You could make a ton of money."
"Phoebe";"Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire bynow, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie."
"Leslie";"Aw, you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry."
"Phoebe";"That’s okay. All right, I’m gonna play song that’sreally, really sad. It’s called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upsidedown to play it.)"

"Monica";"So umm, how was your date with Ginger?"
"Chandler";"Great. It was great. She’s ah, she’s great, great looking,great personality, she’s greatness."
"Monica";"Sounds like she’s got the ah, whole package."
"Chandler";"Joey told you about the leg, huh?"
"Monica";"Uh-huh."
"Chandler";"Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but itdid. I mean I like her, I don’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it’slike ‘Hey, y'know what, where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallestperson in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world."
"Joey";"(entering from his bedroom) Morning."
"Chandler";"(to Monica) Actually he’s the smallest person in the world."
"Joey";"(to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin’ huh?"
"Chandler";"It came up."
"Joey";"Listen, I ah, I know it’s a longshot. But, by any chance did she findthat funny?"
"Ross";"(entering) So I nodded off a little."
"Rachel";"Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’tmake that much noise when it hit rocks!"
"Ross";"Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked aboutstrappy backed dresses."
"Rachel";"Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditoriumlistening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thingthat’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone wedidn’t know it had!’"
"Ross";"First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that littlebone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly."
"Rachel";"Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah,blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah."
"Ross";"Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, Iwonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka."
"Rachel";"Oh, that is so..."
"Ross";"No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes anunusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shakeit off, thinking it’s alive and attacking him.)"
"Rachel";"Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming withme this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?"
"Ross";"No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, Ifeel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these newpeople, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, butI hate that I’m not a part of it."
"Rachel";"It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not apart of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it’s like, I-I-I likethat you’re not involved in that part of my life."
"Ross";"That’s a little clearer."
"Rachel";"Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because Ido. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know,I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it,because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?"
"Ross";"Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)"
"Ginger";"Your thinking about my leg aren’t you?"
"Chandler";"No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?"
"Ginger";"It’s okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I needto know is: ‘How much it bothers you?’ because I don’t like wasting mytime. Am I wasting my time?"
"Chandler";"No. No. I don’t think so."
"Ginger";"Okay. It’s just like anything else, you just have to get used toit."
"Ginger";"What’s that?"
"Chandler";"That’s-that’s my nubbin."
"Ginger";"What’s a nubbin?"
"Chandler";"It’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing."
"Ginger";"You have three nipples?"
"Chandler";"Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...(starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?"
"Ginger";"Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave."
"Chandler";"You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?"
"Ginger";"Ah well, it’s nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I’ll see youlater. Okay. (She leaves and in the hall we see her shake her shoulders like when someoneruns their fingernails across a blackboard.)"
"Phoebe";"(to Leslie) Oh, I thought you weren’t coming. What? Where were you?"
"Leslie";"Come here, come here. (they go to the side of the stage) Okay,don’t get mad, okay."
"Phoebe";"Okay, don’t give me a reason to get mad, okay"
"Leslie";"I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts."
"Phoebe";"No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, andyou just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probablywould’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if Ican’t trust you then just forget it."
"Leslie";"No, no, I don’t want to forget it."
"Phoebe";"Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most importantthing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, butwe won’t be partners. So what’s it gonna be?"
"Commercial";"(in the background their singing Smelly Cat) Problem odour in thelitter box? Don’t change your kitty, change your kitty litter."
"Monica";"Sorry, Pheebs."
"Joey";"Yeah. You okay?"

"Chandler";"The doctor."
"Ross";"Is everything okay?"
"Chandler";"Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, nowaiting."
"Monica";"Wow! It’s like Rachel in High School."
"Rachel";"What?!!"
"Monica";"Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!"
"Chandler";"That was an obvious joke, and I didn’t think of it.Why didn’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!"
"Joey";"(to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar ofolives?"
"Monica";"I won’t give you anything, but you’ll owe me 2.95."
"Joey";"Done."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!"
"Monica";"Why? (in a motherlike tone) Do you have a report due?"
"Phoebe";"I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massagesoutside the UN and, I don’t know where his country is."
"Monica";"Okay, let’s start with the free messages outside the UN."

"Monica";"What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it andfruit flies everywhere.)"
"Rachel";"(looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica it’s on the ceiling."
"Monica";"That’s okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) onmy ceiling! You broke up?!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over."
"Monica";"Oh no!!"
"Rachel";"No."
"Monica";"Rachel, you and Mark?!"
"Rachel";"No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realisedhow much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want tomake it work."
"Chloe";"(entering from bathroom) Morning!"
"Rachel";"(on answering machine) Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reachyou all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me andMark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid."
"Ross";"Yeah!!"
"Rachel";"Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, Idon’t want to get back together over a machine."
"Ross";"Na-huh."
"Rachel";"So, I love you."
"Ross";"I love you."
"Rachel";"And y'know what, I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to bed now, but ah,on my way to work tomorrow morning, I’m gonna stop by around 8:30."
"Ross";"Okay. (Ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)"
"Rachel";"Bye."
"Ross";"Chloe, Chloe how’s it coming?!!"
"Chloe";"(entering from bedroom) Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I shouldget?"
"Ross";"Umm, oh, hey, I don’t know. How about a big one?"
"Chloe";"But my apartment is so..."
"Ross";"Well then a small one!! Listen, let’s, we kinda have to get going!"
"Chloe";"Wait! Where’s my shoes?"
"Ross";"You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches downand picks up a shoe)"
"Chloe";"Do I know why we’re rushing?"
"Ross";"Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?(He’s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe)Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!"
"Chloe";"That’s so great for you guys!"
"Ross";"Yeah!"
"Chloe";"You must be so happy!"
"Ross";"Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I’m feeling. Well.... (picks upher coat)"
"Chloe";"Good luck, with your girlfriend."
"Ross";"Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up betweentheir faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behindthe door) Rachel!!!!"
"Rachel";"Hi. Ohhh, you got my message."
"Ross";"Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time."
"Rachel";"So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?"
"Ross";"Yes, you can, very much."
"Ross";"(seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey."
"Phoebe";"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?"
"Monica";"Oh, there’s banana on it."
"Phoebe";"Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine."
"Monica";"So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)"
"Phoebe";"The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail."
"Monica";"Oh, good. Thanks."
"Phoebe";"Now what is Fabutec?"
"Monica";"Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw thisinfo-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before,except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked soamazing...."
"Phoebe";"Waxine!!"
"Monica";"Yes! Have you seen it?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl."
"Monica";"I know!!"
"Phoebe";"God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they dothat?"
"Monica";"Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rainforest!"
"Phoebe";"They have the best stuff in there."
"Chandler";"Oh my God! Oh my God!"
"Joey";"Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home tomake up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?"
"Ross";"You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do?Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all Ican think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tellher what I did."
"Chandler";"Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the moreimportant question. How dumb are you?"
"Ross";"What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. Howam I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?"
"Joey";"Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am,just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble."
"Chandler";"He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re justgonna hurt her."
"Joey";"Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild."
"Ross";"Yeah, but don’t you think...."
"Chandler";"All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least waituntil the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for."
"Ross";"Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with thefootrest extended.)"
"Joey";"All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find outsome other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think aboutthe trail?"
"Ross";"What trail?"
"Joey";"(stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) Thetrail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!(slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!"
"Ross";"Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail."
"Chandler";"Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’ssister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’sfriends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!"
"Phoebe";"(reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linenstrips to leg number one,"
"Monica";"Did that!"
"Phoebe";"Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pullit off in one quick pain free motion."
"Monica";"Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!"
"Phoebe";"Was it not pain-free?"
"Monica";"No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now witha little wax."
"Phoebe";"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’tseem to think it’s that bad."
"Monica";"That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being sostupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest."
"Phoebe";"(Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!"
"Monica";"Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?"
"Ross";"(entering) Chloe? Hi.."
"Chloe";"Is this about me taking your watch?"
"Ross";"You took my watch?"
"Chloe";"I’m sorry, I do that."
"Ross";"Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?"
"Chloe";"Oh no. I feel it isn’t really anybody’s business, y'know."
"Ross";"Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?"
"Chloe";"Oh, well I tell Issac everything."
"Ross";"You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know wehaven’t actually met..."
"Issac";"You dog!"
"Ross";"Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend."
"Issac";"Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place."
"Ross";"Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her."
"Issac";"Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love ‘em,monogamy is too cruel a rule."
"Ross";"Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?"
"Issac";"Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We’rethe same, you and me."
"Ross";"Actually, no, we’re not."
"Issac";"Yeah, we are."
"Ross";"No, we’re not."
"Issac";"Yeah, we are."
"Ross";"No, we’re not!!"
"Issac";"Okay, we’re not."
"Ross";"Right."
"Issac";"But, we are."
"Ross";"Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister."
"Issac";"I can promise not to tell her again."
"Ross";"(entering out of breath) Jasmine?"
"Jasmine";"Uh-huh."
"Ross";"We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller."
"Jasmine";"You did a bad thing!"
"Ross";"Yes, I did."
"Jasmine";"Very bad!"
"Ross";"Very bad."
"Jasmine";"Very, very bad."
"Ross";"I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebeyet?"
"Jasmine";"No."
"Ross";"Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much,and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?"
"Jasmine";"All right."
"Ross";"Thank you, thank you."
"Jasmine";"But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and heknows Phoebe too."
"Ross";"(angrily) Who’s your roommate?"
"Ross";"Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything toRachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place."
"Gunther";"I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to?"
"Monica";"Ow!"
"Phoebe";"Oh!!"
"Monica";"Ow!! Ow!!"
"Phoebe";"Ow!!!"
"Monica and Phoebe";"Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!"
"Phoebe";"We’re all right."
"Monica";"It’s okay, it’s okay."
"Phoebe";"We’re all right."
"Monica";"We were just waxing our legs."
"Chandler";"Off?!!"
"Phoebe";"For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will everexperience."
"Chandler";"Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unlessyou’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely."
"Joey";"Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men,that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax."
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey’s arm and puts astrip on it.)"
"Chandler";"Oh, that’s mature."
"Joey";"Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?"
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh."
"Monica";"That’s right."
"Ross";"(forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!"
"Rachel";"I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!"
"Monica";"What?"
"Chandler";"Nothing, nothing."
"Monica";"(going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay."
"Phoebe";"(to Joey) What, what are they talking about?"
"Ross";"Rachel?"
"Rachel";"Just get away from me!"
"Ross";"No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?"
"Rachel";"A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!"
"Phoebe";"Whe-where did he put it?!"
"Rachel";"Ross, you had sex with another woman!"
"Monica";"Oh my God."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did notgrow at all yesterday."
"Chandler";"Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk...."
"Monica";"Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this andyou didn’t tell us?!"
"Chandler";"(to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads."
"Rachel";"(opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!"
"Ross";"No!!"
"Rachel";"Just get out! Now!!"
"Ross";"No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this."
"Rachel";"Okay! All right! How was she?"
"Chandler";"Uh-oh."
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"Was she good?"
"Joey";"Don’t answer that."
"Rachel";"Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talkabout it!! How was she?"
"Ross";"She was..."
"Joey";"Awful! Horrible!"
"Chandler";"She was not good. Not good."
"Joey";"She was nothing compared to you."
"Ross";"She, she was different."
"Joey";"Ewwwww!"
"Chandler";"Uh-oh."
"Rachel";"Good different?"
"Ross";"Nobody likes change."
"Ross";"What? Okay, okay, okay, okay."
"Phoebe";"Should we do something?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, never cheat on Rachel."
"Ross";"I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself,and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy,and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible."
"Rachel";"Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friendleave? (Ross can’t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? Shewas in there, when I was in there?!"
"Ross";"Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meantnothing to me!"
"Rachel";"And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!"
"Ross";"Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. Ithought we were broken up."
"Rachel";"We were on a break!"
"Ross";"That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up."
"Rachel";"You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?"
"Ross";"Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought ourrelationship was dead!"
"Rachel";"Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!"
"Joey";"Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes toopen the door)"
"Monica";"(stopping him) What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there."
"Joey";"Why not?! (to Chandler) I’m hungry."
"Monica";"Because they’ll know we’ve been listening."
"Rachel";"God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!"
"Ross";"Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying tomake sure that didn’t happen!"
"Rachel";"Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all overagain."
"Chandler";"Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have moreimportant things to worry about."
"Joey";"Yeah, we’ll be fine."
"Ross";"Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and thenChandler and Joey convinced me not to."
"Chandler";"(handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving,ever."
"Phoebe";"Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00with Mr. Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now, and I’m not there."
"Ross";"Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if Ididn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?"
"Rachel";"All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have beenable to forgive me?"
"Ross";"(pause) Yes I would."
"Rachel";"You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been nakedwith me, and made love to me?"
"Ross";"(less sure) Yes."
"Rachel";"You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were...."
"Ross";"(covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay,okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Becauseit’s, I mean it’s you."
"All";"Ohhhhh!"
"Ross";"What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking?"
"Rachel";"I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza."
"Ross";"Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you?’"
"Joey";"Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathicmessage to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza."
"Phoebe";"We could eat the wax! It’s organic."
"Chandler";"Oh great, food with hair on it."
"Phoebe";"No, not the used wax."
"Chandler";"Because"
"Ross";"Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself."
"Rachel";"Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza."
"Ross";"No anchovies."
"Rachel";"With ah, extra anchovies."
"Ross";"That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off."
"Rachel";"Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there inthe sauce?"
"Ross";"You can have the last piece, if you want."
"Rachel";"Well, I should think so. You slept with someone."
"Phoebe";"They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too."
"Monica";"What if they don’t?"
"Joey";"You think I need a new walk?"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Joey";"Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school.Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think Ineed a ‘take notice’ walk."
"Chandler";"Are you actually saying these words?"
"Ross";"What, now you’re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffeetable) Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. Ithought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insanemust I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I,that’s not me, I’m not Joey!"
"Joey";"Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a ‘come on’look.) Yeah, okay."
"Monica";"Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’vecome home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved."
"Ross";"Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that,that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, thatran when things got just a little rough!"
"Rachel";"That’s...."
"Ross";"That’s what?!"
"Rachel";"That is neither here nor there."
"Ross";"Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. Whatdo you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, doyou wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible,stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but Ican’t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can’t see usthrowing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much."
"Rachel";"No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don’t! You can’tjust kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t workthat way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?"
"Ross";"Okay, okay, okay."
"Rachel";"(softly) I think you should go."
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"(softly) I really think you need to go now."
"Ross";"(moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you saidthere was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together..."
"Rachel";"Yeah, what the hell did I know!"
"Ross";"Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,(takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my lifewithout you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and yourface, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around herwaist) and, and...."
"Rachel";"(crying) No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to menow. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and nowI just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t, (Ross stands up and backs away)it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed,everything. Forever."
"Ross";"(crying) Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean."
"Rachel";"Then how come it is?"
"Phoebe";"They’ve been quiet for a long time."
"Joey";"Maybe she killed him?"
"Chandler";"Let’s go."
"Chandler";"(to Joey) Is that your new walk?"
"Joey";"(whispering) No, I really have to pee."
"Joey";"Can I see the comics?"
"Chandler";"This is the"
"Joey";"Okay,"
"Monica";"Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?"
"Chandler";"We are. He’s meeting us here."
"Monica";"No! Rachel is meeting"
"Phoebe";"Oh come on, they can be in the same room."
"Joey";"Yeah, you shoulda been there last night."
"Phoebe";"Why? What happened now?"
"Joey";"Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over toborrow some moisturiser from Chandler...."
"Chandler";"Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over toborrow something."
"Joey";"Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other."
"Phoebe";"Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept withsomeone else."
"Joey";"Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened,that she should of forgiven him by now."
"Phoebe";"Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand whathe means. Oh my God, this is like"
"Chandler";"Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced.Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts."
"Phoebe";"Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, theynever broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy...."
"Joey";"I had the same dream!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl."
"Joey";"Oh, I had the opposite dream."
"Chandler";"Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been aweek."
"Joey";"Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship."
"Monica";"It’s never taken you more than a"

"Rachel";"Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee."
"Monica";"Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close."
"Rachel";"Closer than here?"
"Phoebe";"(turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I foundcoffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, let’s skedaddle."
"Rachel";"Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee."

"Chandler";"Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smokingpatch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fakelaughs.)"
"Rachel";"Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for twoweeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since."
"Ross";"Pffhah."
"Rachel";"(to Ross) What’s your problem?"
"Ross";"Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap."
"Rachel";"Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City."
"Ross";"Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay."
"Rachel";"Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count ofthree and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks."
"Phoebe";"All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you haveto dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men."
"Chandler";"Or what my Father called Thursday night."
"Ross";"Here you go."

"Frank";"Oh, yeah!"
"All";"Wow!"
"Phoebe";"My little brother’s getting married!!"

"Phoebe";"Do I?"
"Frank";"Do you?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I do, yeah."
"Frank";"Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. (to Joey) I’mgonna, I’m gonna get my ah, my fianc�e man!"

"Phoebe";"Yeah, isn’t it fantastic?"
"Monica";"Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young toget married?"
"Phoebe";"What, he’s 18."

"Alice";"And he was my best student."
"Frank";"Yeah, she was my best teacher."
"Alice";"Ohhh. (They embrace in a very passionate kiss.)"
"Chandler";"If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?"
"Ross";"And so now you guys are gonna be married?"
"Alice";"Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want tohave kids right away."
"Rachel";"Oh my God!! Great!"
"Phoebe";"Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that?"
"Frank";"I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know whodoesn’t want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah,now-now I always will, ‘cause y'know, it’ll be me. Right?"
"Alice";"Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there’s an age differencebetween us."
"Phoebe";"Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t."
"Alice";"Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?"
"Hypnosis Tape";"You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are nowcompletely asleep. You don’t need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. Youare a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman."
"Monica";"And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only goneout with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, yougotta get me back in the game."

"Pete";"Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you’re given’‘em out."
"Monica";"Haven’t you and I covered that topic?"
"Pete";"Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you…."
"Monica";"Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig,and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food."
"Pete";"Well, if that were true, I’d dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two timeswe went out were just plain awkward. (to Rachel) Come on, you think she should go out withme, don’t you?"
"Rachel";"(laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I meanthat ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all indisarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know."
"Monica";"I mean really, think about it."
"Pete";"Ho-ho, I will."
"Phoebe";"No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life, (walks behind them,they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I don’t want tobe all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong!"
"Ross";"Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?"
"Phoebe";"No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it startssticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat!"
"Joey";"Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it."
"Phoebe";"But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up tohis elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is notfair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) andit-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics."
"Joey";"Well, have-have you told him how you feel?"
"Phoebe";"Yes. Not out loud."
"Ross";"Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, andthen you’re gonna hate yourself."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I meanlook at him and his Mom, I can’t. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talkhim out of it."
"Ross and Joey";"No-no-no-no-no. (They start to turn away, but Phoebe stops them,and turns them back to face her.)"
"Phoebe";"Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose.Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!"
"Ross and Joey";"No."
"Phoebe";"Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank. (exits)"
"Joey";"So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say,“Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember? And then, andthen, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.”Well, that was a nice move dumb ass."
"Rachel";"I think you should definitely go out with this guy."
"Monica";"Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me."
"Rachel";"Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on"
"Monica";"Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids….(realises) All right, I get your point."
"Rachel";"All right."
"Chandler";"(entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi."

"Rachel";"Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this isjust so exciting."
"Monica";"Or incredibly offensive."
"Rachel";"Oh yeah, sure, that too."
"Chandler";"(to the girls who are staring at him) What?"
"Ross";"All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything."
"Joey";"Yeah, come on, think about it. You’re 18, okay, she’s 44, whenyou’re 36, she’s gonna be 88."
"Frank";"What, you don’t think I know that?"
"Joey";"Look, the point is, there’s a lot of women out there you haven’teven had sex with yet!"
"Ross";"Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah,you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that."

"Frank";"You don’t have it anymore?"
"Ross";"No, I ah, I slept with someone else."
"Frank";"Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?"
"Ross";"It didn’t."
"Frank";"Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I’ve got withAlice."
"Joey";"Now, wh-what, what is that like?"
"Frank";"It’s so cool man, it’s so, it’s just ‘cause beingwith her is so much better than like not being with her."
"Ross";"Yeah, yeah."
"Joey";"(to Ross) Why can’t I find that?"
"Ross";"Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!"
"Joey";"Well, I want it!"
"Frank";"You can have it!"

"Phoebe";"Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?"
"Alice";"Absolutely. Okay, first we’ll start with a little club soda andsalt, and then if that doesn’t work we can go back to…"
"Phoebe";"Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined."
"Alice";"Oh no-no, never say that. If we can’t get it out then we can cutaround the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw."
"Phoebe";"Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank."
"Pete";"Okay, that’s great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit onthe head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin."
"All";"Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay."
"Secretary";"You have a Miss Monica Geller here."
"Pete";"Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. (Monica enters) Hi."

"Monica";"Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?"
"Pete";"Well, y’know, I never know how much to tip."
"Monica";"You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. Imean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the wayyou get girls to go out with you?"
"Employee";"Umm, I’m still here."
"Pete";"(turns off the TV) You’re taking this all wrong. Because, if Ididn’t leave you that tip, you wouldn’t of come down here, we wouldn’t behaving this argument, and there wouldn’t be this ah, heat between us."
"Monica";"What?!"
"Pete";"Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a newlevel now. ‘Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and nowwe’re like this-this couple that fights."
"Monica";"Okay, umm, you’re a loon."
"Pete";"Look, forget the check, okay. (rips up the check) I like you. I thinkyou’re great. Come on, what do you say?"
"Monica";"I don’t know."
"Pete";"Why not?"
"Monica";"‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour."
"Pete";"One meal! That’s all I’m asking for. Please? We go out, we eat,and if you don’t have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even."
"Frank";"(hiding under a pile of clothes) Hi. (She jumps up screaming.) Wait, no!Just put the mail down. It’s-it’s me!"
"Phoebe";"Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?"
"Frank";"Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thoughtI’d curl up in it. Is that all right?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?"
"Frank";"Oh, well just probably the worst one since I’ve been alive."
"Phoebe";"What umm, what happened?"
"Frank";"Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off."
"Phoebe";"Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?"
"Frank";"Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don’tsee how I could all of the sudden be too young, ‘cause I’m older than I was whenwe first got together."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybeit’s just all for the best?"
"Frank";"Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)"
"Frank";"Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life!After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, andthen, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it’s still really hard to takedeep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And nowit’s, and now it’s gone and I don’t know why!"
"Phoebe";"Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But,y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?"
"Frank";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of madeher see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to,one day, you really, really will."
"Frank";"Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?"
"Phoebe";"Okay."
"Frank";"Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn’t want us to be together, but theworst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch."
"Phoebe";"Okay, but."
"Frank";"Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you’dunderstand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, ora place to go…"
"Rachel";"Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!"
"Chandler";"(in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)"
"Monica";"Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?"
"Chandler";"Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe himanything."
"Monica";"I know!!"
"Chandler";"Okay, then get the lobster!"
"Monica";"(opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!"
"Pete";"Hi."
"Rachel";"Hi!!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hi!"
"Joey";"Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?"
"Monica";"And that’s why, I’m not inviting you in for a drink. (startsto leave) Bye."
"All";"Oh-no-no-no-no…."
"Rachel";"Just one drink?!"
"Monica";"(in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?"
"Pete";"Hey, you like pizza?"
"Monica";"Oh, that’s sounds great."
"Pete";"I know a great little place."
"Pete";"You’re, hey, you’re not paying for the pizza!"
"Monica";"Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, isthat enough lire?"
"Pete";"Ahh, I’d throw another thousand on that."
"Monica";"Why, how much is that?"
"Pete";"That’s about 60 cents."
"Joey";"Every night!!"
"Hypnosis Tape";"You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. Youare a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, whodoes not need to smoke. (Joey walks out smiling to himself.)"
"Phoebe";"Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totallyevil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this betterthan I can."
"Alice";"Hi Frank."
"Frank";"Hi, Mrs. Knight."
"Alice";"Phoebe’s right Frank. I know it’s hard to hear, but itwould’ve been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we,we want the same things now, in the future we may not. (to Phoebe) Is that it, is thatwhat it is?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but not just that."
"Alice";"Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as wedo, none the less…"
"Phoebe";"None the less."
"Alice";"None the less. Umm, you’re too young to, to really know what youwant. (They embrace in a passionate kiss.)"
"Phoebe";"That’s right, exactly. (sees them) All right, it’s a good byekiss, that’s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (Theyboth lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is thatyou see what I’m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignoreher) Okay, I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get mypurse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves)."
"Hypnosis Tape";"Cigarette’s don’t control you. You are a strong,confident woman, who does not need to smoke."
"Joey";"(He’s recorded his voice on the tape) Joey’s your best friEnd.You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) And you also want to buy himhundreds of dollars worth of pants."
"Gunther";"Here you go."
"Rachel";"Thank you."
"Gunther";"(In his head)"
"Mark";"(entering) Hi!"
"Rachel";"Hi! All right, let’s go shoppin’!!"
"Mark";"Um, y'know, before we go ah, there’s something I need to say."
"Rachel";"Oh, okay."
"Mark";"I’ve kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. (Rachel is shocked) Butsince you were with Ross, I-I didn’t do anything about it. But, now that you’renot, I’d really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that’s-that’s whatI’m doing, now."
"Rachel";"Wow! Umm...."
"Gunther";"I dropped a cup."
"Pete";"...so y'know, that’s why, within a few years, that voice recognitionis gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could belike-like, ‘Wash my car.’ ‘Clean my room.’ It’s not gonna be ableto do any of those things, but it’ll understand what you’re saying."
"Monica";"Oh, this is so great."
"Pete";"Yeah, it was."
"Monica";"All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quicklykisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye."
"Monica";"Hello, people who do not live here."
"All";"Hi! Hello!"
"Monica";"I gave you a key for emergencies!"
"Phoebe";"We were out of"
"Ross";"Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?"
"Chandler";"Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife soldseparately."
"Monica";"He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s sofunny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!!"
"Ross";"Still?!"
"Monica";"Noo!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s likethe perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything."
"Chandler";"Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from"
"Monica";"Two."
"Chandler";"Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?"
"Joey";"(entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big oldbaddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner tableand exits)"
"Ross";"I guess he musta gotten the part in that play."
"Monica and Phoebe";"Oh."
"Chandler";"Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythmis going to get you."
"The Director";"Joe. How’s it going?"
"Joey";"Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another castmember.) Hey."
"Kate";"Hi."
"Joey";"Oh, so you’re playing Adrienne, huh?"
"Kate";"Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?"
"Joey";"Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I’m Joey Tribianni."
"Kate";"Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller."
"Joey";"So the ah, play’s pretty great, huh?"
"Kate";"Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray’s work. She’s sobrilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middleclass."
"Joey";"Oh, forget about it. She rocks!"
"Kate";"Where do I know you from?"
"Joey";"Dr. Drake Remoray."
"Kate";"No, that’s not it. So, you’re a soap actor? Well this must bepretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?"
"Joey";"Hey, I’ve done plays before. I’m a serious actor."
"Kate";"That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing!You’re-you’re-you’re the guy that doesn’t know how to pour milk!!"
"Joey";"See, I actually"
"Kate";"Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie."
"Joey";"Yeah, that was real."
"Phoebe";"Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out."
"Rachel";"I know."
"Phoebe";"What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
"Rachel";"Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no."
"Phoebe";"Huh."
"Rachel";"I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing thisGunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’mstanding there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him,which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Rossor something."
"Phoebe";"Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet andyou have issues with your father."
"Rachel";"I don’t have any issues with my Father."
"Phoebe";"Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then."
"Joey";"I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company aboutthat info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, andwhenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me."
"Ross";"(entering) Hello."
"Chandler and Joey";"Hey!"
"Ross";"So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute."
"Joey";"Wow, what-what do you think she wants?"
"Ross";"Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life withoutme.... a-sucks."
"Chandler";"It’s possible. You are very loveable, I’d miss you if Ibroke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive."
"Ross";"Then be supportive like a guy."
"Chandler";"(in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I’d miss you."
"Ross";"Hi."
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Ross";"You ah, wanted to see me?"
"Rachel";"Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)"
"Ross";"What?!"
"Rachel";"Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, justsort of stuff that you’ve left here."
"Ross";"What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?"
"Rachel";"No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know,move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?"
"Ross";"Yes."
"Rachel";"Yeah?"
"Ross";"Yes, I do."
"Rachel";"Good."
"Ross";"Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-thiswas a gift?!"
"Rachel";"Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop."
"Ross";"It’s still a gift! I got it from the"
"Rachel";"Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug."
"Ross";"No!! Y'know-y'know don’t do me any favours. In fact, where,where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, thisbook is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too.Yes, I do."
"Rachel";"You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where thatT-shirt!"
"Ross";"I’m just trying to help you, move on."
"Rachel";"Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty...."
"Ross";"Petty..."
"Rachel";"Petty... (goes into her room)"
"Ross";"Petty..."
"Rachel";"Petty..."
"Ross";"Petty..."
"Rachel";"Small..."
"Ross";"Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mockingher.)"
"Rachel";"You are so just doing this out of spite."
"Ross";"Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!"
"Rachel";"Huh?"
"Ross";"I’m-I’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (hekisses the shirt)"
"Rachel";"You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t evenfit you anymore!"
"Ross";"Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah..."
"Rachel";"(imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!"
"Ross";"Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put onthe T-shirt. It’s an old ‘Frankie says relax’ T-shirt, that barely fitshim. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don’t mind I’mgonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have apleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)"
"Phoebe";"So, you’re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)"
"Chandler";"And you’re our age. You’re our age."
"Phoebe";"Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just nameit after yourself."
"Pete";"What like Pete Dakota?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete."
"Joey";"Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago."
"Chandler";"That’s not a state Joe."
"Joey";"Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?"
"Pete";"I got to go, so ah, I’ll see you guys later."
"All";"Okay."
"Chandler";"You’re our age!"
"Pete";"(to Monica, by the door) So ah, we on for tomorrow?"
"Monica";"Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his headand says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I’m runningout of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am Ionly attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, orthey’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me,and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean,seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, kinda."
"Kate";"Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?"
"Joey";"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh?Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You lookat me, and it’s nothin’. (He kisses her) Nothing."
"The Director";"Tasty! I’m really starting to feel like you guys have ahistory, it’s-it’s nice."
"Kate";"I have a question about this scene."
"The Director";"Yes?"
"Kate";"Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor."
"The Director";"Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking."
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Kate";"I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason thanthat."
"Joey";"Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'knowah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the scripthere that you’re a bitch."
"Kate";"It doesn’t say that in the script."
"Joey";"It does in mine!"
"Chandler";"I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, Istill wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thingon the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?"
"Ross";"You bug me."
"Chandler";"Is there any chance you didn’t see that?"
"Chandler";"Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through thepeep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!"
"Ross";"I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d sayno, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!"
"Chandler";"You didn’t just break up."
"Ross";"Hey, it’s been like three weeks!"
"Chandler";"You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. Imean bullets have left guns slower!"
"Ross";"Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight,I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this. (turns away,then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go,she’s going in."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Ross";"She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! Thedoor’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!"
"Chandler";"And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave."
"Ross";"Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!"
"Chandler";"Stop what?!"
"Ross";"I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there willdo it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!"
"Chandler";"No!! You can’t!!"
"Ross";"Look, they must be stopped!"
"Chandler";"I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!(Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisinglystrong!"
"Ross";"I need juice! People need juice!!"
"Chandler";"Look man!"
"Ross";"People need juice!"
"Chandler";"Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds thedoor shut with his feet.)"
"Ross";"Juice, I need..."
"Chandler";"She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonnabe somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole,"
"Ross";"Yeah, okay."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Ross";"It’s just I miss her so much."
"Chandler";"I know. (He rubs Ross’s head)"
"Mark";"Why do all you’re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?"
"Rachel";"Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them ismissing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’"
"Rachel";"Y'know what?"
"Mark";"No. And I don’t think I’m gonna want to."
"Rachel";"I can’t do this."
"Mark";"Yep. Yep, that’s what I didn’t want to know."
"Rachel";"Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair toyou."
"Mark";"Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I amhere for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch.Right here!"
"Rachel";"Oh God. I’m sorry about this."
"Mark";"That’s okay."
"Rachel";"You sure?"
"Mark";"Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself."
"Spokeswoman";"...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And sotoday, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It istruly ironic, on one hand consider the size..."
"Pete";"(to Monica) Hey, can I ask you something?"
"Monica";"Sure."
"Pete";"Where are we?"
"Monica";"(looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I’m gonnasay, midget rodeo."
"Pete";"Just tell me the truth."
"Monica";"Okay. Umm, y'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told youthis, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship."
"Pete";"Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that like a year ago?"
"Monica";"So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm,the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus onme. Y'know what I mean?"
"Pete";"Oh, yeah. I know that."
"Monica";"I so wanna be attracted to you."
"Pete";"But you’re not. Okay, good."
"Monica";"I’m sorry."
"Pete";"Y'know what, don’t be. This is not, don’t be, ‘causeit’s not so bad."
"Monica";"It’s not?"
"Pete";"I know I’m no John Bon Jovi, (Monica laughs) or someonewho find attractive, I’m just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feelingdifferently."
"Monica";"Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, youseem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too."
"Pete";"Yeah, stupidly charming isn’t’ it? Well listen let’s, youwanna get something to eat? ‘Cause this place is kinda"
"Spokeswoman";"And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker."
"Pete";"(to Monica) One second."
"Chandler";"I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.(He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like agunfighter in a Western.)"
"Chandler";"(to Joey) I wasn’t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwinghis stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?"
"Joey";"Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like thegreatest actress since, since, sliced bread!"
"Chandler";"Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth."
"Joey";"God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m sotalented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell sogood.’"
"Chandler";"I think somebody has a crush on somebody."
"Joey";"Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?"
"Chandler";"I’m talking about you. You big, big freak."
"Joey";"Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind."
"Chandler";"Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If youwere in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!"
"Joey";"Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexualscenarios and stuff huh?!"
"Kate";"Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?"
"Joey";"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh?Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’.You look at me, and nothin’. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing."
"The Director";"You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we’re gonna pick it uphere, tomorrow."
"Kate";"Well, that was ah..."
"Joey";"Better?"
"Kate";"Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G’night."
"Joey";"Ah, Kate?"
"Kate";"Yeah?"
"Joey";"You ah, you forgot your shoes."
"Kate";"(she giggles) I’m probably gonna need those. Huh? (she giggles somemore)"
"Joey";"Hey, listen you ah...."
"Kate";"Hmm?"
"Joey";"...feel like getting a cup of coffee?"
"Kate";"Umm."
"The Director";"(leaning in) Kate?"
"Kate";"Yep."
"The Director";"You ready to go?"
"Kate";"Yeah."
"The Director";"(to Joey) Very nice. Very nice. (he walks away)"
"Kate";"So umm, I’ll see you tomorrow, huh?"
"Joey";"Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight."
"Phoebe";"(to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isn’t itSpiderman? Y’know like Goldman, Silverman..."
"Chandler";"‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name."
"Phoebe";"It isn’t?"
"Chandler";"No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man.Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man."
"Phoebe";"Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!"
"Rachel";"(entering) Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey, Rach, how was work?"
"Rachel";"Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair."
"Monica";"By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff."
"Rachel";"Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw itout, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)"
"Monica";"Something wrong?"
"Rachel";"(She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and takea deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)"
"Chandler";"So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?"
"Phoebe";"Okay well, he would turn things to gold."
"Chandler";"What about things that are already gold?"
"Phoebe";"Ahh, his work is done."
"Chandler";"Okay, let’s play my game now."
"Phoebe";"Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kickup the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)"
"Chandler";"Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is theonly woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!"
"Joey";"Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it’s like to be you?"
"Monica";"Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?"
"Joey";"Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kissher and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s likesomebody’s ripping out my heart!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, it’s so"
"Ross";"(entering) Hey!"
"All";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away."
"Monica";"Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
"Ross";"We were all pretty shaken up about it."
"Phoebe";"Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death wassomething that’s supposed to be sad, in a way."
"Ross";"Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person."
"Monica";"Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (toRoss) And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?"
"Ross";"You get the dollhouse."
"Monica";"I get the dollhouse!"
"Phoebe";"Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel."
"Joey";"Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?"
"Phoebe";"No, just a barrel."
"Monica";"Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse."
"Phoebe";"Really?! Really?!"
"Monica";"Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was toplay with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with."
"Chandler";"My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me."
"Rachel";"Hey, Sophie!"
"Sophie";"Hey, Rach!"
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Sophie";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me allthe way back up here."
"Chandler";"Oh, that’s-that’s okay, no problem. (He starts to lookaround her office.)"
"Rachel";"Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’slingerie here in the office?"
"Chandler";"Yes, I realise that."

"Joanna";"Oh, Rachel, (pause) actually, y'know what, forget it."
"Rachel";"Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too?"

"Monica";"I know!!!"
"Phoebe";"So, I’m here, ready to play."
"Monica";"Okay."
"Phoebe";"I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (Sheremoves this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to thehouse.)"
"Monica";"What’s this?"
"Phoebe";"That’s a dog, every house should have a dog."
"Monica";"Not one that can pee on the roof."
"Phoebe";"Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactivewaste."
"Chandler";"(holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?"
"Phoebe";"No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic."
"Monica";"I don’t want a ghost."
"Phoebe";"Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the houseis sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground."
"Ross";"Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancientIndian burial ground? That would never happen."
"Phoebe";"Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government."
"Rachel";"(entering) Hey!"
"All";"Hello."
"Rachel";"I need to talk to you!"
"Ross";"Sure, what’s up?"
"Rachel";"Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler."
"Ross";"I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)"
"Chandler";"Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase."
"Rachel";"Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions aboutyou..."
"Chandler";"Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin’out the Chan-Chan man!"
"Rachel";"(looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are youinterested at all?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I’ll do it."
"Rachel";"Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me."
"Phoebe";"(holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into thehouse!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.)Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!"
"Monica";"Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, allright? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size,they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go."
"Phoebe";"Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, we’re notwelcome in the house of no imagination."
"Ross";"Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have tosay dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof!"
"Phoebe";"The little ones do."

"Lauren";"Absolutely!"
"Joey";"Yeah?"
"Lauren";"Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft."
"Joey";"They gave me the shaft all right."
"Lauren";"(laughing) Oh, you’re so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doingafter rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?"
"Joey";"Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, adrink sounds great."
"Lauren";"Cool! I-I’ll see you then."
"Joey";"All right."
"The Director";"All right, it’s time to act, my talking props. (Both Joey andKate just look at each other.)"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"All";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!"
"Rachel";"Wow!!"
"Phoebe";"Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealingthe interior.)"
"Ross";"Hey, what’s this?!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slidesa doll down the slide)"
"Monica";"It’s very interesting, Phoebe."
"Rachel";"What’s this?"
"Phoebe";"The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests comeover, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed."
"Ross";"This is the coolest house ever!!"
"Phoebe";"Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights someincense)"
"Rachel";"All right!"
"Ross";"I would!"
"Monica";"Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!"
"Ross and Rachel";"Uh-huh."
"Phoebe";"Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around thehouse.)"
"Ross and Rachel";"Ooohhhh!!"
"Phoebe";"And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)"
"Ross and Rachel";"Ahhhh!!"
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey, my Father’s house does that!"
"Rachel";"(to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything."
"Chandler";"Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothinglike a cool, crisp New York evening."
"Rachel";"Hmm."
"Chandler";"Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, becauseJoanna’s such a"
"Joanna";"Chandler is fantastic!!"
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Joanna";"Oh God, we just clicked! Y’know how people just click? Like he cameby to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?"

"Rachel";"Oh, I know..."
"Joanna";"Oh, I know and he’s soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going tocall, so put him straight through."
"Sophie";"Isn’t this great?!"
"Joanna";"Don’t spoil it."
"Joey";"Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?"
"The Director";"(answering the phone) Hello. Oh! It’s you. Just ah, justone-one sec. (to Joey and Kate) I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope thatthere will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call,"
"Joey";"(to Kate) That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?"
"Kate";"He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweateryou’re dating."
"Joey";"Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’sunderneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care whoI’m going out with?"
"Kate";"I don’t care. Why, do you want me to care?"
"Joey";"Do you want me to want you to care?"
"Kate";"Do you?"
"Joey";"What?"
"The Director";"(returning) Okay, I’m afraid to say this, but let’s pickit up where we left off."
"Joey";"Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?"
"Kate";"I’ve got no reason to stay."
"The Director";"Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is aterrible play! I’ll see you in the morning. (exits)"
"Kate";"I can’t believe we go on in, in a week."
"Joey";"Hey, it’s gonna be all right."
"Lauren";"(to Joey) Hey! So since we’re getting off early, do you want to goand paint mugs?"
"Joey";"What?"
"Lauren";"You know! At the place I told you about last night?"
"Joey";"Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah,y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight."
"Lauren";"Oh, okay."
"Joey";"Okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)"
"Lauren";"I’ll see you tomorrow. (she kisses him full on the mouth.)"
"Joey";"Okay."
"Lauren";"G’night. (exits)"
"Joey";"(to Kate) Ah, are you okay?"
"Kate";"Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?"
"Joey";"I don’t know."
"Kate";"Well umm, maybe if it had more heat."
"Joey";"How do you mean?"
"Kate";"Well, Adrian’s looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can’tjust kiss her, he’s gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?"
"Joey";"Maybe he could slip her the tongue."
"Kate";"Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up."
"Joey";"Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around hiswaist."
"Kate";"And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and hisstomach!"
"Joey";"And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and,and, and bite her!"
"Kate";"And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with thisraw, animal...."
"Joey";"Something like that?"
"Kate";"Yeah, that’s pretty much what I had in mind."
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Joey";"(to Ross) Hey."
"Ross";"Hi."
"Joey";"(to Monica) Hey."
"Ross";"Hi."
"Joey";"Hey."
"Ross";"It’s a little early to be drinkin’."
"Joey";"No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate."
"Ross";"Ohhhhh!"
"Monica";"You’re kidding?! That’s great!"
"Joey";"Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making..."
"Monica";"Oh my."
"Joey";"Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing inand breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keepgoing like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he’s beenprocessed by the devil, or something.)"
"Chandler";"(entering with Rachel) I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it allwrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime.I’ll give you a call.’"
"Rachel";"Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?"
"Chandler";"That’s what you say at the end of a date."
"Rachel";"You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’"
"Chandler";"To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standingthere, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion."
"Monica";"Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’tmean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?"
"Rachel";"Well, they always called."
"Monica";"Hmm, bite me."
"Joanna";"(entering) Did he call?"
"Rachel";"No. Sorry."
"Joanna";"Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?"
"Sophie";"Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women."
"Joanna";"Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t hecalled, Rachel? Why?"
"Rachel";"Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because youare my boss."
"Joanna";"Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?"
"Rachel";"Well..."
"Joanna";"The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’ttell him not to call me, did you?"
"Rachel";"No. I..."
"Joanna";"Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone youwork for, there are always ways to fix...that."
"Rachel";"(grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!"
"Chandler";"Multiple, so many paper cuts."
"Rachel";"Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand.Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out,she’s gone crazy!"
"Chandler";"(sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then."
"Rachel";"Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that youhaven’t called her. You have to call her!"
"Chandler";"Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say,‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’"
"Rachel";"Well then you’re going to have to take her out again."
"Chandler";"Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goopthing in the corner of her eye!"
"Rachel";"I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take herout again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, Idon’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!"
"Chandler";"All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than anhour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybodyever again!"
"Rachel";"That’s fine!"
"Chandler";"That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know."
"Rachel";"I know."
"Ross";"Mon?"
"Monica";"(from the bathroom) I’m in the shower!"
"Ross";"Oh, fire! There, there’s a fire! Fire!!"
"Joey";"Hey."
"Kate";"Hi."
"Joey";"So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did youah, did you talk to Marshall?"
"Kate";"About what?"
"Joey";"Y'know, about what happened with us."
"Kate";"Nooo. And there’s really no reason he should find out, so ahlet’s not make a big deal about it, okay?"
"Joey";"What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on youcan’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there,you’re not that good an actress."
"Kate";"Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That’s all itwas. Joey, I’m-I’m sorry you feel bad, but haven’t you ever sleep with awomen where it meant more to her than it did to you?"
"Joey";"Nooo."
"Lauren";"(entering) Hi, Kate!"
"Kate";"Hi, Lauren."
"Joey";"Hi, Lauren."
"Lauren";"Hi, pig!"
"Ross";"Sorry I ah, I scared you in there."
"Monica";"Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the showermassager."
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey!"
"Monica";"(runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been afire."
"Phoebe";"What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! Whathappened?!"
"Ross";"Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to thepoint of origin.) In the Aroma Room."
"Phoebe";"All right. Did everyone get out okay?"
"Monica";"Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate."
"Phoebe";"Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves toremove it.)"
"Ross";"No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s underthere!!"
"Phoebe";"(She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-theFoster puppets!"
"Chandler";"It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here,(points to his eye) and it’s all the time."
"Joanna";"Well, thanks again for lunch."
"Chandler";"(He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this waspleasant."
"Joanna";"It was, wasn’t it?"
"Chandler";"The food there was, was great."
"Joanna";"Wasn’t it?"
"Chandler";"So take care."
"Joanna";"You too."
"Chandler";"Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it againsometime. (Rachel is disappointed)"
"Joanna";"Great! I’m looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?"
"Rachel";"Sophie’s desk."
"Rachel";"(whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!"
"Chandler";"Noo!"
"Rachel";"Chandler!!"
"Chandler";"Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry."
"Rachel";"Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now.(She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)"
"Chandler";"Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you."
"Joanna";"What?"
"Chandler";"I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I wasgoing to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And thisisn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when itcomes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. AndI’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out."
"Joanna";"Well, this isn’t how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess Ihave to appreciate your honesty."
"Chandler";"Yeah, o-okay."
"Joanna";"So..."
"Chandler";"Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it againsometime!"
"Joey";"(on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’veconsidered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I’ve ah, I’verecently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry. So, doyou think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. (He sits down andcrosses out something, and dials the phone again.) Hello, Jennifer? (listens) Oh hi, Mrs.Loreo, is Jennifer there? (listens) Oh, she’s not home huh? (listens) Well ah,actually I kinda need to talk to you too."
"Rachel";"So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?"
"Monica";"Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God, they took my idea!"
"Monica";"That was you?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)"
"Gunther";"(bringing Rachel a mug) Rachel, I made you a cocoa."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God, are you guys okay?"
"Gunther";"Are you all right?"
"Joey";"(leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel who ismoaning in pain.) Oh my."
"Chandler";"(sporting a goatee) Hey."
"Joey";"Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan."
"Chandler";"Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me.(there’s no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen,"
"Joey";"Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy’s theory.Okay?"
"Ross";"(entering) Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Ross";"(triumphantly) I’m gonna be on TV!!"
"Chandler";"No way!"
"Ross";"Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these fossilsthey just found in Peru and"
"Chandler";"Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!"
"Ross";"Thanks. You ready to go?"
"Chandler";"Yeah. (they start to leave)"
"Joey";"Saw a girl with that vest."
"Chandler";"Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)"
"Anchorwoman";"(on TV) While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets astraditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. (Joey isintrigued by the idea) Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guyswon’t live to see the fourth of July. (Joey starts to call a place to buy a littlebaby chick) Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead."
"Joey";"(on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? ‘Cause Iwas watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!"
"Pete";"Hi!"
"Monica";"Hi! Hey, Pete you’re back! Hey, check this out. (She starts toskate over to him)"
"Pete";"Wow! Skates!"

"Pete";"Ah, which ever is closest."
"Monica";"Okay. (hands him a cup)"
"Pete";"So ask me what I did today."
"Monica";"So what did you do today Pete?"
"Pete";"I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef."
"Monica";"What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)"
"Monica";"Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?"
"Rachel";"What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?"
"Monica";"I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Ovenand opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I cantotally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) ButPete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me."
"Rachel";"And you’re still not attracted to him at all?"
"Monica";"Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-Ican’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade."
"Rachel";"Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re healthteacher."
"Monica";"Oh, please."
"Monica";"What? Honey."
"Rachel";"Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday."
"Monica";"Oh God, I’m so sorry."
"Rachel";"I know."
"Rachel";"Ow!!"
"Monica";"Oh God!"
"Ross";"(entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey, you guys!Guess what?"
"Rachel";"(looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?"
"Ross";"Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it.Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so..."
"Rachel";"Oh I see, so this suit is making a point."
"Ross";"Right."
"Rachel";"Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look asstupid as you like."
"Ross";"(to Monica) You like it right?"
"Monica";"Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.(Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, come here!"
"Monica";"What-what was it you were gonna tell us?"
"Rachel";"Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!"
"Ross";"Okay, good bye! (leaves)"
"Chandler";"So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it takefor the roller skating thing to happen."
"Phoebe";"Umm, oh, about three months."
"Chandler";"Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the toplessthing kicks in."
"Joey";"(entering carrying a box) Hey!!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Joey";"I got you something! Open it! Open it!"
"Chandler";"Okay. (He opens it and it’s a baby chick) It’s a chicken."
"Joey";"It’s cute, huh?"
"Phoebe";"Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?"
"Chandler";"Fowl? No. Women? Nooo."
"Phoebe";"Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. Theyrequire constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’sof love."
"Joey";"Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight,and talks to it like it’s a little baby.)"
"Chandler";"Easy Lenny."
"Pete";"So? I mean have you thought about it?"
"Monica";"Okay. Here’s the thing."
"Pete";"Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What’s the thing?"
"Monica";"I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see youhave these feelings for me...."
"Pete";"Wait, wait, wait, wait, that’s-that’s what you’re worriedabout? If that’s the problem, we’ve got no problem."
"Monica";"Huh?"
"Pete";"No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else.On my trip."
"Monica";"Oh?"
"Pete";"Her name’s Ann, she’s a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane.She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we hada big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting."
"Monica";"Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m sohappy for you. And now I can work for you!"
"Pete";"I guess you can."
"Monica";"Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and kisses himon the cheek) All right, y'know what? I’m just gonna roll right into that officeand-and quit!"
"Pete";"All right."
"Monica";"Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?"
"Pete";"Yeah, sure. Good luck!"
"Monica";"(rolling towards the office) I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She rollsthrough a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past thedoor the other way.) I’m okay!! I’m all right!!"
"Phoebe";"(to Pete) Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman."
"Pete";"What?"
"Phoebe";"I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?"
"Pete";"Why would you say that?"
"Phoebe";"‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there wassomebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if youspent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and..."
"Pete";"You’re good. You’re good!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantialgift."
"Pete";"Listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though?"
"Phoebe";"Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?"
"Pete";"Thanks a lot."
"Phoebe";"No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks."
"Chandler";"Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here,and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joeyenters)-chickeeeen."
"Joey";"Hey."
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Joey";"How’s she doing?"
"Chandler";"She?"
"Joey";"Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?"
"Chandler";"I don’t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying todetermine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I can’t tell, what ever it was wentback in too quickly."
"Joey";"Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the castfor drinks."
"Chandler";"Excuse me?"
"Joey";"What?"
"Chandler";"I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebodycould be here with our chick!"
"Joey";"Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock thismorning trying to get her back to sleep?"
"Chandler";"You don’t think I get up when you get up?"
"Joey";"Ohhh, here it comes."
"Chandler";"Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come inand spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?Well I don’t think so mister!"
"Joey";"Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!"
"Chandler";"And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?"
"Joey";"That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant..."
"Chandler";"I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got thischick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?"
"Joey";"I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick."
"Chandler";"I’ll take her back tomorrow."
"Joey";"Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?"

"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Vince";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Vince is a fireman."
"Rachel";"Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?"
"Vince";"98 hot saves, highest in the force."
"Chandler";"Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up toan even hundred."
"Vince";"(dead serious) Fire safety is not a joke, son."
"Chandler";"You're right, I know."
"Vince";"(to Phoebe) Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. (kisses her) See youSaturday. (leaves)"
"Phoebe";"Okay. (watches him leave)"
"Rachel";"Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating thatKindergarten teacher."
"Phoebe";"Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight."
"Rachel";"What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you."
"Phoebe";"I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling twoguys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin',field-playin' juggler."
"Joey";"So Pheebs, do they know about each other?"
"Phoebe";"Does a dog's lips move when he reads? (Joey makes an `I don't know'face, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't."
"Ross";"(entering) Hey guys!"
"Joey";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Joey";"(going over to him) Well?!"
"Chandler";"(joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?"
"Ross";"Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totallybenign."
"Joey";"Well what is it?!"
"Ross";"He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin...abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identifyit, he was reluctant to remove it."
"Chandler";"Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in therewith my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I meannot as lucky as people who were born with two nipples."
"Ross";"At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name."
"Joey";"Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross.And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross.""
"Ross";"(sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!"
"Monica";"Pete's breaking up with me."
"All";"What?!"
"Monica";"I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back fromAtlanta,"
"Rachel";"And?"
"Monica";"Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's somethingbad."
"Joey";"Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you."
"Monica";"Really?!"
"Joey";"Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you."
"Jason";"...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's prettycool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life."
"Phoebe";"That is so great! Oh, I... (sees that a parked car near them has caughton fire) Oh my God!"
"Jason";"Whoa!"
"Phoebe";"(the fire has worsened) Oh my God!!!"
"Jason";"Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!"
"Phoebe";"(stopping him) No! No!"
"Jason";"No, no?"
"Phoebe";"Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic.(hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get outof here!"
"Jason";"W-w-w-wait! Why?!"
"Phoebe";"Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (shedrags him away)"
"Ross";"Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-millthird nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!"
"Dr. Rhodes";"Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.(Ross starts to take off his pants) What are you doing?"
"Ross";"Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple."
"Dr. Rhodes";"Well that's not a third nipple."
"Ross";"No?"
"Dr. Rhodes";"First of all, it's on your ass."
"Ross";"Well then, what is it?!"
"Dr. Rhodes";"Wait a minute, hold it. (He goes to the door and opens it.) Johnson!Will you come in here a moment?"
"Dr. Johnson";"I'm with Hamilton!"
"Dr. Rhodes";"He's good with rear things, bring him in too."
"Monica";"(starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'knowwhat, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I"
"Chandler";"Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should waterhis plants. If y'know what I mean."
"Joey";"Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them."
"Phoebe";"(entering with Rachel) …and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just,always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy."
"Rachel";"Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?"
"Phoebe";"(disgusted) Uh."
"Joey";"Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?"
"Phoebe";"Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work.It's like I'm working in the field."
"Rachel";"So Pheebs, pick one of them."
"Monica";"Yeah. Which one do you like more?"
"Phoebe";"Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He'sso burly, he's sooo"
"Joey";"Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive."
"Chandler";"Well sensitive is important, pick him."
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Joey";"Oh sure, go with the sissy."
"Phoebe";"Jason is not a sissy!"
"Joey";"Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler."
"Ross";"Y'know I have dinner plans!!"
"Dr. Rhodes";"Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies andgentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'mstumped."

"Monica";"It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying inbed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazineshut in amazement.) I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, andit’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean Ican’t. Right?

"Ross";"What?! What?!"
"Guru Saj";"We appear to have angered it."
"Ross";"We?! We angered it?!"
"Guru Saj";"Oh, I think I see the problem. And I’m afraid we’re gonnahave to use a much stronger tool. (Ross gives him a ‘What?’ look) Love."
"Ross";"Oh God!"

"Monica";"(Robin is speaking loudly again) I..."

"Billy";"So it’s-it’s not heeled yet?"
"Robin";"No-no, it’s ooozing, oozing. (to Rachel) Could you pass me thecream? Is there any—Oh, there’s the cream."
"Billy";"Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, andnobody else."
"Robin";"What is it, Tim?"
"Billy";"It’s me, I’ve been sleeping with your wife."
"Joey";"(to Billy) So you’re the gynaecologist?"
"Billy";"(to Joey) Hey, I’m trying to have a private conversation! Is thatokay?!"
"Robin";"(starting to cry) Ooh, (to Rachel) Can I have a napkin, please? Could youplease hand me a napkin? (Rachel tries to grab one, but is to slow for his tastes.)

"Billy";"Thomas, come back here! (they both leave)"
"Phoebe";"So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?"
"Monica";"(pause) I have no idea."
"Rachel";"So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Orshould I say Mrs. Monica Becker?"
"Phoebe";"No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name."
"Monica";"He didn’t ask me to marry him."
"All";"Ohh."
"Phoebe";"Well then"
"Monica";"He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fightingcompetition thingy."
"The Guys";"Pete?!"
"Rachel";"Why?! What is it?"
"Monica";"I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling."
"Phoebe";"(intrigued) Oh?!"
"Monica";"Yeah, but without the costumes."
"Phoebe";"(disappointed) Oh."
"Joey";"And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal."
"Chandler";"Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are:“They’re"
"Monica";"So you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff?"
"Ross";"Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking."
"Monica";"What’s fish hooking?"
"Ross";"Huh, what’s fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Ross’smouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic)Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?"
"Joey";"What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath."
"Doug";"So thanks for the warm welcome. It’s good to have you guys on myteam, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let’s go out there and get‘em! Huh? And remember, there is no ‘I’ in team."
"Chandler";"Yes, but there’s two in martini, soo everybody"
"Doug";"(to Chandler) You! Chuckles! What’s your name?"
"Chandler";"Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah..."
"Doug";"No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. (Chandler starts toleave) This team is about hard work, but it’s also about having fun. Good to have youaboard Bing! (smacks him on the butt, and Chandler leaves shocked.)"
"Ross";"(on phone) That’s right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thankyou. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah, we have the reservations."
"Rachel";"Yes!!"
"Chandler";"All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)"
"Ross";"(stunned) Dude, what are you doing?"
"Chandler";"Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting likeit was no big deal."
"Phoebe";"Yeesh, what’d you do about it?"
"Chandler";"Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy whohas a problem with his boss slapping his bottom."
"Monica";"I gotta tell ya, I think it’s okay to be that guy."
"Joey";"Yeah, maybe it’s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how footballplayers pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt)"
"Rachel";"Y'know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I wouldnever congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your headin between ‘em."
"Monica";"Okay, can we please go eat?"
"Joey";"Yeah. What are we getting?"
"Monica";"(to Chandler) Anything but stew."
"Ross";"All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance toget you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him."
"Joey";"Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is youcould rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes tosmack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt thatwould smell bad?"
"Chandler";"(to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?"
"Phoebe";"Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if Iset Ross up on a date?"
"Rachel";"Oh, ah with who?"
"Phoebe";"Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute,and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but ifyou’re not cool with it..."
"Rachel";"Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?"
"Phoebe";"You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah,like, average height, medium build, bald..."
"Rachel";"Oh! (laughs) That’s fine."
"Phoebe";"Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)"
"Hoshi";"You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when Icall your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?"
"Pete";"I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could weconcentrate on my training?"
"Hoshi";"It’s just hard when I know I have e-mail"
"Monica";"(entering) Hi!"
"Pete";"Monica! (runs over and kisses her) Hi honey."
"Hoshi";"All right, on the table. (Pete gets on the table for his rubdown)"
"Monica";"Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about thisah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t wantyou to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you."
"Pete";"Oh, believe me, I don’t want to get hurt either. I’m being smartabout this. See these guys? They’re the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi hereused to be a paid assassin. (Hoshi yells at him in Chinese) A house painter! He used to bea house painter."
"Monica";"Promise me you’ll be careful."
"Pete";"I promise."
"Monica";"Hey, are we still on for tonight?"
"Pete";"Yeah."
"Monica";"Okay, good, ‘cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workoutof our own..."
"Hoshi";"No! No boom-boom before big fight!"
"Monica";"How ‘bout just a boom?"
"Rachel";"(to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a softpretzel from one of the kids from"
"Phoebe";"Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)"
"Bonnie";"Hi!"
"Rachel";"This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) You’reBonnie?"
"Bonnie";"I can show you an ID if you want?"
"Rachel";"Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-Isaw you."
"Bonnie";"Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again."
"Rachel";"Oh, that must be it."
"Phoebe";"(to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight."
"Bonnie";"Thanks! You too."
"Rachel";"(to Phoebe) You said she was bald."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now."
"Rachel";"How could you not tell me that she has hair?"
"Phoebe";"I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people."
"Rachel";"(looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!"
"Phoebe";"Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay."
"Rachel";"Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick.I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got"
"Phoebe";"Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like herpersonality."
"Rachel";"Why, does she have a bad personality?"
"Phoebe";"Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!"
"Doug";"Bing! (Chandler stands bolt upright and turns around to face him.) Readyour Computech proposal, a real homerun. (He goes to slap his butt, but Chandler slidesover making him miss.) Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. (Chandlergoes over) Wham! (slaps him on the butt) Good one. That was a good one. (to a couple ofChandler’s co-workers) Keep at it team. (goes into his office)"
"Chandler";"(to his co-workers) What is with him?"
"Phil";"With him? You’re is favourite, you’re his guy!"
"Stevens";"We never get smacked."
"Chandler";"Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once."
"Phil";"Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me."
"Stevens";"I’m telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid startingDartmouth in the fall."
"Doug";"(coming out of his office) Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouthsucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?"
"Chandler";"No sir."
"Doug";"There you go. (smacks him on the butt)"
"Ross";"(walking up with this"
"Monica";"God Ross, what is that?"
"Ross";"Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents,plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!"
"Announcer";"From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate FightingChampionship debut! He’s known for his confrontational business style. Ladies andGentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!"
"Monica";"I love you, Pete!!!"
"Announcer";"And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He’s a 300pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!"
"Monica";"(going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!"
"Pete";"Don’t worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent’s strengthand weight against him."
"Ross";"Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble."
"Ross";"All right! You go get him! Let’s go!"
"Referee";"Here we go gentlemen, here we go! (to Tank Abbott) Are you ready? (Henods, and takes out his teeth) (to Pete) Are you ready? (Pete nods, “Yes.”)Let’s get it on!!"
"Pete";"Uh-oh."
"Monica";"Hey! (she sits down next to him) It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tellyou how proud I am of you."
"Pete";"It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant “You suck!”"
"Monica";"I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And nowyou can just look back at this thing with no regrets."
"Pete";"What, look back?"
"Monica";"Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?"
"Pete";"Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?"
"Monica";"Well, no. But..."
"Pete";"Well I’m not gonna stop until I’m the Ultimate FightingChampion."
"Monica";"That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!"
"Pete";"Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you thinkit just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad’s garage,there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that Ilearned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck."
"Monica";"You didn’t know that already?"
"Pete";"Look, I’m gonna get better. Okay? I promise you."
"Monica";"Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast."
"Pete";"Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may haveaffected my concentration."
"Monica";"Yeah. That-that was the problem."
"Monica";"(joining them) Hey."
"Ross";"Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?"
"Monica";"Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing hisopponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves."
"Ross";"Hot dog?"
"Monica";"Four, please. (Ross looks at her) I’m really nervous. (Ross givesher the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)"
"Phoebe";"So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?"
"Ross";"What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all,I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s reallyterrific."
"Phoebe";"Ohh, that’s too bad!"
"Ross";"No, I-I’m saying I liked her."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea."
"Ross";"Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again."
"Phoebe";"Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?"
"Chandler";"(joining them) Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?"
"Ross";"Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry."
"Joey";"(sticking his head out the window) Hey, the fight’s starting!"
"Ross";"Okay, we’ll be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try toslap you again today?"
"Chandler";"Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna beokay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes asplanned, my butt will be smack free."
"Joey";"(sticking his head out the window) Fight’s over!"
"Chandler";"Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!"
"Doug";"(turning around) Bing! You got those numbers for me?"
"Chandler";"No, I ah, I didn’t do them."
"Doug";"Oh, you forgot?"
"Chandler";"No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with acouple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise,verbal or otherwise."
"Doug";"Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, TapanziBridge never looked smaller. (laughs) That’s okay, you’re still my number oneguy! (slaps him on the butt) Bing!"
"Chandler";"Doug!!"
"Doug";"Hmm."
"Chandler";"I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you expressyourself."
"Doug";"Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because Igotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!"
"Chandler";"No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah,the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock."
"Doug";"Oh?"
"Chandler";"Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’sjust that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making allthe other guys jealous."
"Doug";"Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing!You’re okay."
"Chandler";"Okay. (he starts to leave)"
"Doug";"Ha! (goes to smack him on the butt, but stops, faking Chandler out)Ahhhhhhh!"
"Chandler";"Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)"
"Phoebe";"Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, orinside his shower drain?"
"Rachel";"(seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look,it’s Ross and that girl."
"Phoebe";"No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) It’s a lineof ants! They’re working as a team!"
"Rachel";"Phoebe! (goes back to the window)"
"Phoebe";"(looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross isbreaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go."
"Rachel";"Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them.Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’swhat that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh..."
"Phoebe";"Oh no! That really is nothing, she is"
"Rachel";"Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Nowhe loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault."
"Phoebe";"You said it was okay!"
"Rachel";"You said she was bald!!"
"Phoebe";"What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!"
"Rachel";"Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, wehave to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave herhead! You owe me one bald girl!!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it.Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?"
"Rachel";"(quietly) Yes."
"Phoebe";"Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?"
"Rachel";"Yes."
"Phoebe";"So?"
"Rachel";"I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff.Ooo-ooh! (sits down on the curb)"
"Phoebe";"(sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, we killed them all."
"Rachel";"Oh!"
"Pete";"It’s okay, it’s not as bad as it looks, it’s a precaution.Ah, I’m not supposed to move my spine."
"Monica";"Please tell me you’re stopping now."
"Pete";"I’m fine! I’d fight tonight, if they’d let me. (stands upand starts swinging his arms) See this circle I’m marking off here? This is my zoneof terror."
"Monica";"You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!"
"Pete";"I can’t until I’m the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I’mtelling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me orSuperman. Now, I’m not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid."
"Monica";"Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible atthis! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!"
"Pete";"Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my rightforearm, and a severely bruised Adam’s Apple, but that really hurt."
"Monica";"Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurtyourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do itwithout me."
"Pete";"Well if you’re asking me to quit, then you’re asking me to besomeone I’m not. I’ve got to do this."
"Monica";"Then I’ve gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)"
"Pete";"Mon-Monica?"
"Monica";"Yes?"
"Pete";"Could you leave a note? ‘Cause I’m on a lot of pain killers now,and I don’t know if I’ll remember this tomorrow. (She leaves.)"
"Doug";"So, in conclusion, the lines all go up (points to the chart), so I’mhappy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. (They start to leave) Phil! Nice job. (smacks himon the butt) Stevens! Way to go! (smacks him on the butt) Joel-burg, you maniac! I loveya! (smacks him on the butt) (Chandler walks up) Bing! Good job, couldn’t have doneit without ya. (he shakes his hand)"
"Chandler";"Thank you, sir."
"Stevens";"(coming back in) Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, byaccident."
"Doug";"Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! (smacks him onthe butt) (to Chandler) Well, what about you? You’re not feeling left out or anythingare ya?"
"Chandler";"No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous."
"Doug";"Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don’t you?"
"Chandler";"Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!"
"Doug";"Now get on out of here, you! (smacks him on the butt)"
"TV Announcer";"Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’sjust trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just..."
"Chandler";"Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!"
"Rachel";"Oh, I can’t watch this. (turns her eyes away)"
"Joey";"Check it out, he’s winning! (to Monica) Pete’s winning!"
"Monica";"Really?!"
"Joey";"No-o-o!!"
"TV Announcer";"Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for hisfavourite area."
"All";"Oh! Oh! (they all recoil in horror)"
"Phoebe";"Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?"
"Ross";"Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’twant to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t."
"All";"Ohh!! (they all start pointing at the screen)"
"Chandler";"(to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!"
"Bonnie";"All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk onthat hard cider, and then suddenly, I don’t know, we were, we were making out."
"Chandler";"Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously."
"Rachel";"(to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything elsebut sex?"
"Joey";"Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography."
"Monica";"Joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in."
"Joey";"Well, I think we all learned something."
"Phoebe";"(entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this!(She hands Chandler a picture) That’s my Mom’s writing! Look."
"Chandler";"(reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation1965."
"Phoebe";"Y'know what that means?"
"Joey";"That you’re actually 50?"
"Phoebe";"No-no, that’s not, that’s not"
"All";"Oh!"
"Rachel";"That is so cool."
"Phoebe";"I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of storiesabout my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, andshe lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?"
"All";"Yeah! Yeah, we can!"
"Bonnie";"(to Ross) Shoot! I can’t go, I have to work!"
"Ross";"That’s too bad."
"Rachel";"(sarcastic) Ohh, big, fat bummerrr."
"Phoebe";"So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk."
"Joey";"Hey, Bonnie had sex there!"
"Monica";"(watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look at them. AmI ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid."
"Chandler";"You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook."
"Monica";"(sarcastic) Thanks!"
"Chandler";"Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your boyfriend."
"Monica";"Yeah right."
"Chandler";"Why is that so funny?"
"Monica";"You made a joke right? So I laughed."
"Chandler";"Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?"
"Monica";"Well, no. You’re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the arm)"
"Chandler";"Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But theoreticallyy'know, I mean say we weren’t friends, say it’s a blind date. I show up at yourdoor, and I’m like (in a fake voice) “Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.”"
"Monica";"Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice."
"Joey";"(walking up carrying a brown paper bag) Hey!"
"Monica";"Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!"
"Joey";"No, it’s just my luggage."
"Chandler, Monica, and Joey";"Hey!!"
"Joey";"Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman whoknew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house."
"Ross";"Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I wasn’t talking about his karma."
"Rachel";"(approaching) Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey-hey, check out the hat!"
"giant";"giant"
"Chandler";"What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They didexperiments on me! I can’t have children!!"
"Monica";"Seriously, where did you get the hat?"
"Rachel";"Ross gave it to me."
"Ross";"Yeah, I think she looks good."
"Rachel";"Ohh, thank you."
"Chandler";"Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?"
"Rachel";"Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you thathats are back."
"Phoebe";"And this time, they’ve ganged up to form one giant, super hat."
"Ross";"Go, go, go!"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!"
"Phoebe";"Oy!!"
"Monica";"What’s with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of thefloor, which is covered in sand)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage."
"Ross";"Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat."
"Phoebe Sr";"Well, yes, it’s kind’ve an unusual house. It has umm, threebeautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there."
"Phoebe";"(at the door) Knock, knock, knock."
"Phoebe Sr";"(on phone) Ah, oh, hang on a second. (to Phoebe) Come in, come in.(on phone) All right, so think about it, and call me back. (hangs up)"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?"
"Phoebe Sr";"Ahh, yes."
"Phoebe";"Hi Phoebe Abott, I’m your best friends daughter!"
"Phoebe Sr";"You’re Erwin’s daughter?!"
"Phoebe";"No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. (hands her the picture)Lily, from high school. Remember?"
"Phoebe Sr";"Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?"
"Phoebe";"(points to herself) Phoebe. (points to her) Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. Shenamed me after you I guess."
"Phoebe Sr";"Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There’s Frank. (points to the picture.)"
"Phoebe";"Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That’s my Dad, that’s Frank! Yeah!I’m sorry I’m getting all flingy."
"Phoebe Sr";"Take it easy--if you want, there’s cookies on the counter, or,or--sangria! (jumps up) I can make sangria!"
"Phoebe";"No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks."
"Phoebe Sr";"Oh."
"Phoebe";"(goes and gets some cookies) Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve been,I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?"
"Phoebe Sr";"Oh no, I-I’m sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody afterhigh school."
"Phoebe";"(disappointed) Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents.Everything."
"Phoebe Sr";"Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nicknamefor the three of us."
"Phoebe";"Oh, what? What was it?"
"Phoebe Sr";"The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. (Phoebe notices a picture on thefridge, takes it, and puts it in her pocket.) Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened,that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way."
"Phoebe";"(happily) Yeah, no, it was great."
"Joey";"(getting an idea) Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?"
"Monica";"What?!"
"Joey";"I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker."
"All";"No, no!"
"Monica";"What are you crazy?!"
"Joey";"Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it’s like a law!"
"Rachel";"(to Monica) Allll done!"

"Phoebe Sr.";"Noo! No! It wasn’t like that I... Remember how I told you howLily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close."

"Phoebe";"(interrupting) I’m not asking!"
"Phoebe Sr.";"Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I wasstupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it’s like tobe eighteen years old?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off,and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand."
"Phoebe Sr.";"Well, I’m so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the bestparents in the world, I didn’t even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of yearsago, and by then you were already grown up. I don’t know, you’re here, and Iwould, I would really, I would like to get to know you."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y'knowyou had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! Y'know what, you walkedout on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you."
"Phoebe Sr.";"Wait!"
"Phoebe";"I don’t"

"Phoebe";"No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone."
"Phoebe";"(turning around, insistently) Monica!"
"Monica";"Oh."
"Ross";"It’s over."
"Rachel";"Oh, was it awful?"
"Ross";"Well, it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was, until Inoticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stopthemselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left."
"Rachel";"I wrote you a letter."
"Ross";"Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turnsaway.)"
"Rachel";"(handing him the letter) It’s just some things I’ve beenthinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of usgetting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff."
"Ross";"Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing himfrom making contact.) Wow, it’s-it’s 5:30 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So,I’d better get cracking on this baby."
"Rachel";"Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done."

"Rachel";"(coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts theletter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Whydidn’t you come up?"
"Ross";"Done!"
"Rachel";"You just finished?"
"Ross";"Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, veryimportant to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!"
"Rachel";"So umm, does it?"
"Ross";"I’m sorry."
"Rachel";"Does it?"
"Ross";"Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’part just another glance."
"Rachel";"What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even"
"Ross";"(interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t"
"Rachel";"Are you sure?"
"Ross";"Oh, sure! I’m sure."
"Rachel";"I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away fromthe letter.)"
"Chandler";"All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man onEarth. Would you go out with me?"
"Monica";"Ennnh."
"Chandler";"I’ve got canned goods."
"Joey";"(jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, youguys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Checkthis baby out, dug me a hole!"
"Chandler";"Excellent hole, Joe."
"Joey";"Oh no! No!! My hole!!"
"Monica";"(screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!"
"Joey";"(climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!"
"Monica";"Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!"
"Chandler";"Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!"
"Monica";"It’s like two miles!"
"Joey";"Yeah, and I’m a little tired from digging the hole."
"Monica";"Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!"
"Chandler";"We’ve got to do something!"
"Joey";"Well, there’s really only one thing you can do."
"Monica";"What?! What is it?!"
"Joey";"You’re gonna have to pee on it."
"Monica";"What?!! Gross!!"
"Joey";"Don’t blame me, I saw it on"
"Chandler";"Y'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammoniain that, that like kills the pain."
"Monica";"Well forget it! It doesn’t hurt that (tries to take a step)"
"Joey";"If you want some privacy you can use my hole."
"Phoebe";"Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachelcuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod ‘Yes.’) Ohh!That’s so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod ‘No.’) But for you, yay!Ohh."
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"How was the beach?"
"Monica";"Nothing, I don’t know."
"Ross";"What happened?"
"Monica";"Nothing. I’m gonna take a shower."
"Chandler";"Me too!!"
"Joey";"Me too."
"Phoebe";"Okay, I’m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car."
"Rachel";"Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?"
"Ross";"It does. It really and truly does."
"Ross";"(finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does"
"Ross";"She wants"
"Chandler";"Oh my God! If you say that one more time,"
"Ross";"Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she sayshere, (reading from the letter) “If you accept full responsibility...” (toChandler and Joey) Full responsibility! “...I can begin to trust you again. Does thatseem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!”"
"Joey";"No?"
"Chandler";"Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel. Ifyou bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you."
"Ross";"(calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you’re right. Yeah I guessI’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this."
"Joey";"Sure, it’s hard to forget! But that doesn’t mean you have totalk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler)ever talk about."
"Ross";"What the hell happened on that beach?!"
"Joey";"It’s between us and the sea, Ross!"
"Phoebe";"(to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula."
"Ursula";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, well umm, I know that we haven’t talked in a long time, butumm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom."
"Ursula";"Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm."
"Phoebe";"(shocked) You know her?!"
"Ursula";"No, I umm, I read about her in Mom’s suicide note."
"Phoebe";"There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods ‘Yes.’) Well, doyou still have it?"
"Ursula";"(disgusted) Hang on. (She goes into her apartment and slams the door inPhoebe’s face.)"
"Phoebe";"I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!"
"Ursula";"Yeah. So how have you been doing?"
"Phoebe";"I, umm, shut up!"
"Phoebe";"(reading from the note) “Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll missyou. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!"
"Ursula";"Well, it’s pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. Youread the poem, right?"
"Phoebe";"Noooo!!"
"Ursula";"All right, hang on! (She takes the note, goes back into her apartmentand slams the door shut.)"
"Monica";"Pass the cheese, please."
"Monica";"My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?"
"Joey";"Nope."
"Chandler";"(jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!"
"Phoebe";"No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk."
"Chandler";"I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us."
"Ross";"(coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you thinkabout making that beach trip an annual thing?"
"Chandler, Monica, and Joey";"NO!!!"
"Rachel";"All right, that’s it, you guys! What happened out there?"
"Monica";"What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all overme."
"Ross and Rachel";"Come on!"
"Ross";"What happened? Joey?"
"Joey";"All right. (gets up)"
"Monica";"(stopping him) No! Joey, we swore we’d never tell!"
"Chandler";"(running over and joining Monica) They’ll never understand!"
"Joey";"Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It’s eating mealive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish."
"Monica";"(interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the livingroom) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn’t stand. I-I couldn’t walk."
"Chandler";"(following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone.We didn’t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica’sshoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)"
"Monica";"I was in too much pain."
"Joey";"And I was tired from digging the huge hole!"
"Chandler";"And then Joey remembered something."
"Joey";"I’d seen this thing on"
"Ross";"Wait a minute! I saw that! On"
"Phoebe and Rachel";"Ewwww!!"
"Monica";"You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought Iwas gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way.So... (looks at Joey.)"
"Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel";"(turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!"
"Joey";"That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help!And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn’t. I got thestage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned toChandler."
"Chandler";"(wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, “Do itnow! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here thescreaming."

"Rachel";"You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!"

"Monica";"What, that little thing at the prom?"
"Rachel";"Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having sex withAmy Welch!"
"Monica";"Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?"
"Rachel";"I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!"
"Monica";"Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
"Rachel";"Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same highschool."
"Monica";"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride offChip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a banduniform they had to have specially made."
"Rachel";"(shocked) They had to have that specially made?!"
"Monica";"It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes."
"Rachel";"(stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!"
"Monica";"Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go outwith a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And thefat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat."
"Rachel";"Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her)"
"Monica";"Oh, really?!"
"Rachel";"Yeah. Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and gohave sex with another guy?"
"Monica";"I’ll try."
"Ross";"So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?"
"Joey";"Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don’t thinkany of them are gonna work out."

"Phoebe";"(is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming,trying to get away! Just like when she was alive."
"Ross";"So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?"
"Phoebe";"Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used tothe fact that there’s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she’s worried thaty'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice)Well, that’s not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call inthe other room."
"Monica";"Why can’t you use the phone in here?"
"Phoebe";"Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. Ijust spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica’s room)"
"Ross";"So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a"
"Monica";"Ross, don’t start."
"Ross";"Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-thatthere’s a woman inside that cat!"
"Rachel";"I believe it."
"Ross";"No you don’t."
"Rachel";"Yes, I do."
"Ross";"No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this."
"Rachel";"Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right."

"Chandler";"Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe."
"Tony";"You gotta take the canoe!"
"Chandler";"All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when youget home, throw the canoe away!"

"Joey";"(looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!"
"Rachel";"Do we have to tell her?"
"Ross";"Yes, we have to tell her!"

"Rachel";"Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.)It’s a little old but…"
"Mr. Treeger";": No! You’re clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hourunclogging!"
"Rachel";"I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot."
"Mr. Treeger";": Oh yeah, of course you don’t!"
"Rachel";"No."
"Mr. Treeger";": ‘Cause you’re a little princess! "Daddy, buy me apizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of"
"Rachel";"I didn’t… I never said that."
"Mr. Treeger";": You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls willcome in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don’t think of someone else for achange?"
"Rachel";"(starting to cry) Okay, I’m sorry. (Runs out still carrying thepizza box.)"
"Monica";"God! If you’re gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes tothrough it out.]"
"Joey";"Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?"
"Rachel";"Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true."
"Joey";"I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson."
"Monica";"Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we justforget about it."
"Rachel";"That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed."
"Joey";"All right that’s it, school is in session! (Exits and slams thedoor.)"
"Monica";"(Picking up a card from Chandler’s wallet.) My God! Is this a gymcard?"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’vemissed the last 1200 times."
"Ross";"So why don’t you quit?"
"Chandler";"You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I"

"Chandler";"Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycraspandex covered gym…treat."
"Ross";"You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?"
"Chandler";"No!"
"Ross";"So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?"
"Chandler";"Oh no, you’ll have to come."
"Mr. Treeger";": Tribbiani! Hold on, I’ll get the plunger."
"Joey";"Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now,you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call thelandlord."
"Mr. Treeger";": And tell him what?"
"Joey";"Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry."
"Mr. Treeger";": Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Actof 1968!"
"Joey";"I have actually"
"Mr. Treeger";": Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I’ve been anice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief. I’m gonna call thelandlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother’sapartment. Your friends are outta here pal."
"Joey";"Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know! (He storms out,and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an ‘Oops!’ have.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!"
"Monica";"What’s the matter?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and everytime I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for."
"Monica";"So do them for free."
"Phoebe";"Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for foolingaround with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse."
"Ross";"They make you take an oath?"
"Phoebe";"No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients andumm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it justmakes good sense."
"Chandler";"Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?"
"Phoebe";"No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional. (She starts to leave)"
"Rachel";"Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?"
"Monica";"Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up."
"Chandler";"Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s onthe table!"
"Monica";"You’re gonna do some feet flirtin’!"
"Phoebe";"I don’t what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues toleaqve)"
"Ross";"Then how do you explain the toe ring?!"
"Phoebe";"Because it’s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!"
"Rachel";"Oh! My hero! What happened?"
"Joey";"Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends likethat and that he’d better come up here and apologize. I’ll see you later.(Starts to leave)"
"Monica";"What a minute, what did he say?"
"Joey";"He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are livinghere illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll seeyou later."
"Rachel";"What?! You got us evicted!!"
"Monica";"I told you not to go down there!"
"Joey";"Well he made Rachel cry!"
"Monica";"Rachel always cries!"
"Rachel";"That’s not true! (Starts to cry.)"
"Monica";"Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck likeyou’ve never sucked before!"

"Rachel";"What are you ever gonna use that for?!"
"Chandler";"To pay for the gym."
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Phoebe";"Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we startedmaking out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore."

"Rachel";"Sweety..."
"Phoebe";"I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next,y’know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then thesepolicemen, thought I was a whore too. It’s been a really bad day, whore wise."

"Ross";"Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)"
"Rachel";"What was that?"
"Ross";"Monica knows."
"Monica";"It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool ourparents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember Icried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I wasactually cooler than my older brother."
"Ross";"Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my datetonight, so ah, I'll just_ head."

"Monica";"Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?"
"Rachel";"I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could goup to your old room, and not make out."
"Monica";"Ross, cough drops, please?"
"Ross";"At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies."
"Rachel";"Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorryI forgot, she's not a lesbian."
"Ross";"You see Amanda and I have a very special..."
"Monica";"(interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're herbaby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!"
"Rachel";"(laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad."
"Monica";"And what are you laughing at, Miss`My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'"
"Rachel";"Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me somethingwith it! (Shows her, her ring)"
"Monica";"That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? Andget me my cough drops!"
"Ross";"Fine."
"Rachel";"Sorry."
"Ross";"Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to Rachel) At least I made ten bucksin my relationship."
"Rachel";"Y'know..."
"Phoebe";"(singing)"
"Gunther";"I like it. (sneezes)"
"Phoebe";"Gunther, kiss me."
"Gunther";"What?"
"Joey";"(opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart boardover the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actuallygonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?"
"Chandler";"Can I sleep on your couch?"
"Phoebe";"(singing)"
"Gunther";"Rachel?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Gunther";"I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe theother day_"
"Rachel";"No!"
"Gunther";"Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn'tstop it, and I've been feeling guilty."
"Rachel";"(confused) Okay."
"Gunther";"So umm, are we cool?"
"Rachel";"(really confused) Okay."
"Gunther";"I knew you'd understand."
"Cheryl";"So, thank you for the delicious dinner."
"Ross";"You're welcome for a delicious dinner."
"Phoebe";"Hey what are you guys looking at?"
"Chandler";"Ross and the most beautiful girl in"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, come to papa."
"Ross";"I know!"
"Monica";"Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the"
"Chandler";"Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back ofChandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobicsinstructor, what?"
"Ross";"Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in thecentazoic era."
"Chandler";"Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era."
"Ross";"I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made herdinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow."
"Rachel";"Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who canbring home the biggest geek."
"Ross";"Fine by me; hope she wins."
"Chandler";"Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?"
"Phoebe";"Oo! Is it for my birthday present?"
"Chandler";"Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it justhasn't come yet?"
"Chandler";"Well, I have a call in about that."
"Phoebe";"'Kay."
"Chandler";"Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of herfavorite book."
"Rachel";"Oh,"
"Chandler";"Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils."
"Rachel";"Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair."
"Chandler";"Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talkedto a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren."
"Rachel";"Oh, honey, that's so sweet."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate'sgirlfriend!""
"Chandler";"It doesn't say that. Does it?"
"Ross";"How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incrediblymeaningful"
"Chandler";"Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her somethingreally great."
"Phoebe";"It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!"
"Monica";"(Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I amsorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral forsixty people."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! What happened?"
"Monica";"Sixty"
"Ross";"So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?"
"Monica";"Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something thatbig on such short notice. I mean there's no way."
"Phoebe";"Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , notMonican... (Monica looks almost puzzled) ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playingaround with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?"
"Monica";"I don't know."
"Phoebe";"There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lendyou money, but just get moving!"
"Monica";"Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies andstuff."
"Phoebe";"Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked inmonths."
"Monica";"Well, you're not working either."
"Phoebe";"Yes, but I'm doing this."
"Monica";"Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Everyone";"Hey."
"Kathy";"Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?"
"Joey";"Why?"
"Joey";"You can pee here!"
"Kathy";"Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me."
"Chandler";"It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into thebathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?"
"Joey";"We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get hersomething?"
"Everyone";"Yeah!"
"Rachel";"Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice."
"Joey";"Oh, I know..."
"Rachel";"And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love.""
"Phoebe";"Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?"
"Rachel";"No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answersand I really want to finish a whole one without any help."
"Phoebe";"Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language."
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey, how'd it go?"
"Monica";"Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food,and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow—the dead-guy-from-today'sbest friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!"
"Phoebe";"Mon! I'm so happy for you!"
"Monica";"Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff."
"Phoebe";"I'll have one, please. Plus my money."
"Monica";"Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, youtold me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all thisstuff. But look—I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money Imake from that."
"Phoebe";"Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank."
"Monica";"Okay."
"Ross";"(moved by the kiss) Huh..."
"Cheryl";"Um, would you like to come in?"
"Ross";"Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?"
"Cheryl";"According to recent findings!"
"Cheryl";"(throwing food around the room) Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!"
"Ross";"Mitzi is....."
"Cheryl";"My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat."
"Ross";"(mouths "where?") Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh (steps on some garbageand falters) ...do you have any"
"Cheryl";"What?"
"Ross";"Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles,break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh..."
"Cheryl";"I'd rather not."
"Ross";"Oh, yeah, why not?"
"Cheryl";"Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weirdsmell."
"Monica";"Oh, is everything in the car?"
"Phoebe";"Yes. Did you settle the bill?"
"Monica";"No. I hate this part."
"Phoebe";"Oh, look what we almost left. (Picks up a coffee maker)"
"Monica";"No, that's not mine."
"Phoebe";"Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!"
"Monica";"Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen."
"Mrs. Burkart";"Oh, good. Thank you."
"Monica";"Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of..."
"Mrs. Burkart";"Dear?"
"Monica";"Just the matter of ...payment?"
"Mrs. Burkart";"(in grief) Jack used to handle the finances! (Breaks into tears)"
"Rachel";"You know what we should all do? Go see a musical."
"Chandler";"(confused) Sure..."
"Rachel";"And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do youhappen to know the name of that one?"
"Chandler";"I don't know... um, Grease?"
"Rachel";"No...."
"Chandler";"Rent?"
"Rachel";"Yes! Rent!"
"Chandler";"Okay, so when do you want to go?"
"Rachel";"What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy."
"Joey";"(entering the apartment) Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls."
"Chandler";"Yes, it is, at"
"Rachel";"What did you get her? (Joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up apen.)"
"Chandler";"A"
"Joey";"It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?"
"Chandler";"Huh-huh! You can't give her that."
"Joey";"Why not?"
"Chandler";"Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!"
"Rachel";"Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift,maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?"
"Joey";"Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over...."Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!""
"Chandler";"All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delvecciofor her birthday?"
"Joey";"She didn't have a birthday while we were going out."
"Chandler";"For three years?"
"Joey";"(whining and heading toward the door) Look, it's too late, and I got anaudition. I can't shop anymore! I..."
"Chandler";"All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?"
"Joey";"Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?"
"Chandler";"Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?"
"Joey";"Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it."
"Phoebe";"But Mon, you have to get our money!"
"Monica";"Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tearslooked giant."
"Phoebe";"I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother'sfuneral was?"
"Monica";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are somepeople who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massagewasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know,"these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!""
"Monica";"Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?"
"Phoebe";"Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill."
"Monica";"Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me."
"Mrs. Burkart";"(singing) You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, andforever in peace may you wave...."
"Phoebe";"She seems fine now."
"Mrs. Burkart";"(singing) ...emblem of the land I love. The home of...."
"Joey";"So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?"
"Ross";"You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And insteadof a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end oftime, and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and handsit to Joey who puts it on.) Here."
"Joey";"Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?"
"Ross";"What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there."
"Joey";"All right, so... next time, you take her to your place."
"Ross";"No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell."
"Joey";"What kind of smell?"
"Ross";"I don't know."
"Joey";"All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Joey";"You wanna see her again, right?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Joey";"So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!"
"Ross";"Yeah, okay you're right."
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Ross";"I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?"
"Joey";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"It's, uh... it's endearing, really."
"Joey";"All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! (Ross hesitates, looks unsure)Oink!"
"Chandler";"Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a presentfor Kathy that would be better than"
"Rachel";"Any luck?"
"Chandler";"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible thingsfor Kathy." (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me ahand with all this stuff?"
"Rachel";"All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her theclock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen."
"Chandler";"She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want herto have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her."
"Rachel";"Aw, honey, that's so sweet."
"Chandler";"Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?"
"Rachel";"Oh! Pathetic! (Grabs the crossword puzzle and starts writing.)"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all overfor you!"
"Chandler";"Where?"
"Joey";"Our place, the hall! I..."
"Chandler";"I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package, shakes it next tohis ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) It's a book!"
"Joey";"(Unimpressed) A book? (Suddenly interested) Is it like a book that's also asafe?"
"Chandler";"No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the"
"Joey";"You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. (Joey leaves,comes back in.) Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?"
"Chandler";"No, it came out to an even twenty."
"Joey";"Wow. That's almost as much as a"
"Mrs. Burkart";"(singing) Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers,creepers, where'd you get those eyes?"
"Phoebe";"You didn't get the money, did you?"
"Monica";"Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let'sjust go!"
"Phoebe";"No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinksshe is! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey, widow?"
"Mrs. Burkart";"(Singing) Come on along and listen to..."
"Phoebe";"Okay, Widow!"
"Mrs. Burkart";"(Singing) ...the lullabye of..."
"Phoebe";"Excuse me. Excuse me! (Mrs. Bukart stops singing) Thanks. Um, clearly thisis a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve tobe paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paidevery penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no placeelse to go."
"Mrs. Burkart";"All right. I'll get my bag."
"Phoebe";"Good. (Phoebe and Mrs. Burkart go into the other room, leaving Monica witheveryone staring at her.)"
"Monica";"I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event."
"Cheryl";"So you want to come inside?"
"Ross";"(mustering up courage) Yes. Yes I do. (They go inside.)"
"Cheryl";"I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable. (Ross attempts to clear aplace for his coat and fold it small enough to fit. Then hit sits on the couch. Somethingfalls on him from above and he brushes his neck off frantically.)"
"Cheryl";"(sneaking up behind Ross) Guess who?"
"Ross";"Department of Sanitation?"
"Cheryl";"It's me!"
"Ross";"Oh! (She kisses him) Ah. (They kiss more, and move down onto the couch.Ross's hand moves under some garbage) Aw! (His hand is covered with something brown andgooey.)"
"Cheryl";"What?"
"Ross";"(trying to make his disgust into lust) Ah, Cheryl!"
"Cheryl";"Oh, Ross!"
"Cheryl";"Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!"
"Ross";"Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out."
"Cheryl";"(looking in the bag) Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat."
"Rachel";"I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody tohug!"
"Gunther";"Move!"
"Rachel";"Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!"
"Phoebe";"Uh... yay!"
"Rachel";"Thanks!"
"Monica";"Oh, that's great! Congratulations!"
"Rachel";"Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?"
"Monica";"Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til shedid."
"Phoebe";"Yeah. I'm a hard ass."
"Monica";"And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners."
"Phoebe";"Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!"
"Monica";"Wait a minute, Phoebe! We"
"Phoebe";"Okay!"
"Monica";"I can cook and you can take care of the money."
"Phoebe";"Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!"
"Both";"(screaming with excitement) Aah!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?"
"Joey";"Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now."
"Chandler";"Oh yeah? That's great!"
"Joey";"Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this,because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!"
"Chandler";"[nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh...."
"Kathy";"Hey."
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey! Happy birthday."
"Kathy";"Thank you!"
"Joey";"You know, uh... [Joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] Chandler gotyou a gift, too."
"Chandler";"No he didn't. [Moving it back.]"
"Joey";"Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!"
"Chandler";"Happy birthday! I'm"
"Kathy";"You really didn't have to. (Opens the box) Wow."
"Chandler";"See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a"
"Kathy";"Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. (They hug)."
"Chandler";"Oh, yeah... yeah."
"Joey";"Ah. Hm. (To Kathy) Wanna go to bed?"
"Kathy";"I'll be in in a minute."
"Joey";"Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. (Tries to strike a sexy pose up againstthe doorway to his room. Then goes inside)."
"Chandler";"[to Kathy] Goodnight."
"Kathy";"Um, thank you for the gift."
"Chandler";"Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you...you don't always know the exact time."
"Kathy";"No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book."
"Chandler";"Uh, the book?"
"Chandler";"What do you mean?"
"Kathy";"Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know yalike Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard itmust have been for you to find."
"Chandler";"(tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that soundwas, "Uhl, ell.""
"Kathy";"You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him."
"Chandler";"Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend."
"Kathy";"Well...."
"Chandler";"Goodnight. (Goes to his room.)"
"Joey";"(opening bedroom door) Hey, that coupon expires, you know."
"Monica";"Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister."
"Cheryl";"Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out."
"Monica";"Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep,thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?"
"Monica";"No?"
"Chandler";"(entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathynaked! It was like torture!"
"Ross";"Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a"
"Chandler";"It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s badenough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I thinkshe knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird likeenergy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seenher naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine herbody was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth!Smooth! (leaves)"
"Phoebe";"Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?"
"All";"Yeah! Oh my God!"
"Casey";"Here you go."
"Joey";"Great! All right, so I’ll call you later."
"Casey";"Great! (leaves)"
"Chandler";"(rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?"
"Joey";"That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight."
"Chandler";"Goin’ out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) Sothings didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer."
"Joey";"No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with hertonight, right after my early dinner with Casey."
"Chandler";"(shocked) What?"
"Joey";"Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza bymyself! (Laughs)"
"Chandler";"Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!"
"Joey";"Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?"
"Chandler";"Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having sex with an endlessline of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can’t believe he justsad that.)"
"Joey";"What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive."
"Chandler";"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. ButCasey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense thatshe’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you."
"Joey";"You got all that from the back of her head?"
"Chandler";"All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know?Make a choice, pick a lane."
"Joey";"Who’s Elaine?"
"Phoebe";"(singing) ""
"Ross";"Oh, you could just go uh, ""
"Phoebe";"Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’"
"Ross";"Well umm, y’know, I used to play."
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?"
"Ross";"Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it incollege. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound."
"Monica";"Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worthit. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound."
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Monica";"He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was everyallowed to hear, "The Sound.""
"Phoebe";"I wanna hear "The Sound.""
"Ross";"Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, wellit’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?"
"Phoebe";"Come on, play that funky music white boy."
"Monica";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in—No, yeah,okay. (Runs out.)"
"Ross";"Okay, guys."
"Chandler";"All right! Bring it on, you…"
"Ross";"Here we go. (Plays one note) Y’know, I’ve-I’ve never playedmy stuff for anyone before, so it’s important that-that you understand it’sabout communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y’know, umm, youshould-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That’s whatI’m…"
"Chandler";"(interrupting) Oh my God! Play!"
"Monica";"(At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm… terrific."
"Chandler";"Really, bitchin’!"
"Phoebe";"Wow, it was so—wow!"
"Ross";"Really?! I mean, really?!!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!"
"Ross";"Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play youanother piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll beright back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I’m—I am so…(starts to break up and leaves)"
"Monica";"Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!"
"Rachel";"Oh, I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers."
"Phoebe";"What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plusit’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear."
"Chandler";"You mean like, music?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes, yes, your breastsare just as firm and juicy."
"Chandler";"Come in!"
"Kathy";"(entering) Hey! (sees what’s on TV) Oh God, is that"
"Chandler";"Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles."
"Kathy";"So is Joey around?"
"Chandler";"No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. Souh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?"
"Kathy";"I uh, don’t really have a preference. You?"
"Chandler";"I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) …of theboat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello."
"Joey";"(on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, it’s me. Listen Casey and Iwere on our way back and had a little car trouble."
"Chandler";"What happened?"
"Joey";"We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get sometransmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there assoon as I can."
"Chandler";"Why can’t you tell her?"
"Joey";"‘Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is aboutto—(he stops talking suddenly)"
"Chandler";"Joey! Joey!!"
"Joey";"Yeah?"
"Chandler";"I thought your time ran out."
"Joey";"Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more—(his time runs out forreal)"
"Chandler";"(to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. He’s running a little late, hesays he’s sorry."
"Kathy";"Oh."
"Chandler";"So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then."
"Kathy";"Oh, okay."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I think it is!"
"Kathy";"So what did you do today?"
"Chandler";"Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut…"
"Kathy";"(interrupting) Oh, it looks great!"
"Chandler";"…and then it got canceled."
"Kathy";"Well, I could cut it."
"Chandler";"Really?! You do that?"
"Kathy";"Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt’s dog grooming shop, buthey, what do you say?"
"Chandler";"Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don’t make my tail too poofy."
"Kathy";"You have really great hair."
"Chandler";"Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers throughhis hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y’know who also hasgreat hair is Joey!"
"Kathy";"Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I’m basically done here. Justlet me get this off your neck."

"Joey";"(very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream!Man, how did you afford this stuff?"
"Chandler";"Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account."

"Chandler";"Or Casey."
"Joey";"No-no, Kathy."
"Chandler";"Could be Casey."
"Joey";"No. No, Kathy."
"Chandler";"Consider Casey."
"Joey";"Y’know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush onCasey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?"
"Chandler";"That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!"
"Ross";"(to Phoebe) Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!"
"Ross";"Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want toplay anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?"
"Phoebe";"Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah."
"Ross";"Pheebs…"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be reallyy'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.I…"
"Ross";"See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I…I won’t play anymore."
"Phoebe";"Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if Iknew I was depriving the world of your music."
"Ross";"Yeah, okay."
"Ross";"Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice."
"Monica";"Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!"
"Chandler";"I kissed Kathy."
"Ross";"What?"
"Monica";"Are you serious?"
"Phoebe";"Does Joey know?"
"Chandler";"No. Is there anyway,"
"Monica";"You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends. (They alllook at her) Which we all appreciate."
"Ross";"No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before youkissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside."
"Chandler";"Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Isit?"
"Phoebe";"I think maybe, yeah."
"Monica";"He loves you."
"Chandler";"Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!"
"Ross";"Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe."
"Phoebe";"Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea."
"Rachel";"I know, I remember that!"
"Monica";"I remember you did."
"Chandler";"God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!"
"Rachel";"Well, Chandler, you’re gonna have to tell him."
"Chandler";"Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!"
"Rachel";"Because you do."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I know."
"Ross";"Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this."
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey! Samboucha Margarita?"
"Chandler";"Is that a real thing?"
"Joey";"Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now."
"Chandler";"Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something."
"Joey";"What’s up?"
"Chandler";"It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lotactually."
"Joey";"You do?"
"Chandler";"Yeah."
"Joey";"Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not mygirlfriend anymore."
"Chandler";"What?"
"Joey";"Yeah, she broke up with me."
"Chandler";"Oh uh, when?"
"Joey";"Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kindof scene, that’s why I let people watch."
"Chandler";"Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?"
"Joey";"Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?"
"Chandler";"Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too."
"Joey";"No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay."
"Chandler";"Yeah?"
"Joey";"Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you came to me first."
"Chandler";"Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do."
"Joey";"But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut outfor you. ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s intosome other guy. So…"
"Chandler";"See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to youabout. I-I think I know who the other guy is."
"Joey";"Who?"
"Chandler";"It’s me. I’m the other guy."
"Joey";"What?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got totalking, and one thing to another and…"
"Joey";"And what?! Did you sleep with her?!"
"Chandler";"No! No! No! I just kissed her."
"Joey";"What?!! That’s even worse!!"
"Chandler";"How is that worse?!"
"Joey";"I don’t know! But it’s the same!"
"Chandler";"Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I thinkI’m in love with her!"
"Joey";"Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!"
"Chandler";"You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line."
"Joey";"Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, thatyou-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!"
"Chandler";"Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!"
"Joey";"Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like"Well, kinda.") Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will notlisten to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker thatI’m not gonna eat! You know why?!"
"Chandler";"Probably because…"
"Joey";"Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on thisapartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either. (The bread makerdings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroomand slams the door.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it."
"Monica";"(removing ear plugs) What?"
"Rachel";"Phoebe, his music could not"
"Ross";"Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it.Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish myset?"
"Phoebe";"After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help."
"Ross";"Yeah, like I could"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Ross";"I played bad on purpose guys."
"Monica";"Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time."
"Ross";"Yeah—no, just that last song."
"Joey";"(answering phone) Hello."
"Chandler";"(on phone) Hey, it’s me. I know you can’t stand to be in thesame room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone. All I…(Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)"
"Joey";"(answering phone) Hello."
"Chandler";"Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I’m…(Joey hangs up the phone again.)"
"Joey";"(answering phone) Stop callin’!!"
"Voice";"(on phone) Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 dailychallenge."
"Joey";"All right!"
"Voice";"What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would doanything… (Joey realizes it’s Chandler and hangs up the phone in anger.)"
"Chandler";"(entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!"
"Phoebe";"Look everyone, it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!"
"Rachel";"So are things with you and Joey any better?"
"Chandler";"They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him lastnight, just trying to get him to talk to me."
"Rachel";"Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of thoseplug-in telephone headsets huh?"
"Ross";"Should we"
"Rachel";"You shouldn’t."
"Phoebe";"Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a newbusiness and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and thenwe each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who."
"Ross";"Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don’t know why I do that."
"Rachel";"Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy."
"Monica";"We haven’t eaten yet!"
"Rachel";"I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, Ijust… (goes into her bedroom.)"
"Chandler";"Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa,‘cause I wanna trade for her."
"Phoebe";"I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!"
"Chandler";"Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?"
"Phoebe";"Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s likeimpossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let’s trade!"
"Chandler";"Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpackand she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran offwith it… (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe’s faces.) Oh, there was no bigdog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put onit… (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials…"
"Phoebe";"Ohh."
"Monica";"Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller."
"Chandler";"Op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase."
"Monica";"Who cares? He works in a museum!"
"Chandler";"Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!"
"Phoebe";"You don’t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren’t here, you canwatch the parade if you want."
"Chandler";"Thanks."
"Monica";"What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer anda piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!"
"Phoebe";"God, what happened?!"
"Monica";"Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!"
"Rachel";"(standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!"
"Chandler";"Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts."
"Phoebe";"Open it up, let me see."
"Monica";"Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills."
"Chandler";"Well maybe you should put some ice on it."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, God it looks bad."
"Rachel";"Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor."
"Monica";"No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’thave a boyfriend!"
"Chandler";"He’s really picky about his patients."
"Phoebe";"Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?"
"Monica";"Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7."
"Phoebe";"(on phone) Hi! Yeah, I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’seye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He’s out of town,but does she want to see the on-call doctor?"
"Monica";"Yes!!"
"Phoebe";"Yes! She’s very excited about that."
"Phoebe";"This is so cool, ‘til Monica gets back, it’s like I’mhead chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, andthen decides to add it to the dish.)"
"Ross";"Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, get out of my kitchen!"
"Chandler";"(entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress withJoey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammedthe door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it."
"Phoebe";"All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cookingquestion."
"Ross";"So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m alreadygetting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch."
"Chandler";"Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you."
"Ross";"Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?"
"Chandler";"I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for youroffice."
"Ross";"Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me."
"Chandler";"Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonnaget stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets."
"Ross";"Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never tookback."
"Chandler";"Like?"
"Ross";"Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year."
"Chandler";"When was the last time you saw her wear it?"
"Ross";"Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…"
"Chandler";"Big dog?"
"Ross";"(entering) Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Ross";"What are you doing?"
"Joey";"I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt."
"Ross";"Everything? Even the TV?"
"Joey";"No! I’m putting that in my room."
"Ross";"Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think youcould at least hear the guy out?"
"Joey";"Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, wouldyou hear him out?"
"Ross";"That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?"
"Joey";"Five years."
"Ross";"You’ve sentenced him?!"
"Joey";"Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time."
"Ross";"Joey, the guy’s your best friend."
"Joey";"No,"
"Ross";"Oh, who? Me?"
"Joey";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my firstact as your best friend?"
"Joey";"What?"
"Ross";"I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler."
"Joey";"All right. But if you weren’t my best friend."
"Chandler";"I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumblessomething in Italian. And I"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?"
"Chandler";"Hey Joe."
"Joey";"(Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)"
"Doctor";"I’ll be right with you. Okay? (to the nurse) Thanks, Wendy."
"Monica";"Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?"
"Rachel";"Ooh, so cute, that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye."
"Nurse";"Dr. Burke will see you know."
"Monica";"Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-calldoctor will see me now."
"Nurse";"Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will seeyou now."
"Dr. Timothy Burke";"Ready?"
"Chandler";"Hey! I’m sorry! That—(sees that Joey is about to leave)where are you going?"
"Joey";"My folks."
"Chandler";"Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?"
"Joey";"I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for anapartment."
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Joey";"Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know,work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…"
"Chandler";"Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say thatI’ll stop seeing her?"
"Joey";"Look, it’s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together justreminds me of what you did. And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’tknow what it is to be a friend. So, I’ll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandlergrabs his bag and stops him.)"
"Chandler";"Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!"
"Joey";"Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving."
"Chandler";"All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at leaststay for them! Okay, they have had a"
"Joey";"When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unitfor like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking abouthow I let you down!"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Joey";"Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turnout to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!"
"Chandler";"All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to besomething that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get init for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?"
"Joey";"We’ve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)"
"Tim";"Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you werejust standing outside"
"Monica";"I was probably waiting for it to open."
"Tim";"I gotta tell you, you look great now."
"Monica";"You look great too."
"Tim";"You’re an excellent patient!"
"Monica";"So how does it look?"
"Tim";"Well, you’ve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have towear a patch for a couple of days."
"Monica";"Like a pirate?!"
"Tim";"If that helps you."
"Monica";"Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her)Come on, one of us had to mention him."
"Tim";"I moved back here a couple of months ago."
"Monica";"Oh. Big family dinner tonight?"
"Tim";"Uh. (He holds up a brown lunch bag.)"
"Monica";"No way!"
"Tim";"I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend’s."
"Monica";"(disappointed) Oh."
"Tim";"But we broke up."
"Monica";"(happy) Oh."
"Tim";"She-she wasn’t ready for a serious commitment."
"Monica";"(sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirate’s voice) So you made her walk theplank? Aye, matie?"
"Tim";"You’re not wearing the patch yet."
"Monica";"I know."
"Ross";"He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!"
"Rachel";"I know, it’s sick."
"Monica";"Why is it sick?"
"Rachel";"Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greektragedy over for dinner!"
"Monica";"Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no. I’msorry, but I think it’s twisted."
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Joey";"(coming out of the bathroom) What’s twisted?"
"Monica";"Me going out with Richard’s son."
"Joey";"Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!"
"Chandler";"(He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really badidea to me."
"Rachel";"Is he okay in there?"
"Joey";"He’s fine!"
"Ross";"Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son,you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather."
"Monica";"Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian,(points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay icedancer, (points to Joey) threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler)livin’ in a box!! (goes to her room)"
"Rachel";"So now, what exactly is the point of the box?"
"Joey";"Chandler?"
"Chandler";"The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up throughthe air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up anotherfinger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up athird finger), it hurts!"
"Ross";"(to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you lastyear? Can I see it?"
"Rachel";"(worried) Why?"
"Ross";"I just wanna check something."
"Rachel";"Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)"
"Ross";"(He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, we’llsee."
"Chandler";"Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)"
"Rachel";"(coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. Iwear it all the time."
"Ross";"(grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one issilver."
"Rachel";"Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed."
"Ross";"Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!"
"Rachel";"Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoyand that I can get a lot of use out of?"
"Ross";"What did you get?"
"Rachel";"Credit."
"Monica";"(running in from her bedroom) I’ll get it! I’ll get it!I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it!I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it!I’ll get it! I’ll get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim."
"Tim";"Hi. (gives her a bottle of wine)"
"Monica";"Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe."
"Tim";"Hi, nice to meet you."
"Monica";"And Joey."
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Tim";"Hi, Joey."
"Monica";"My brother, Ross."
"Ross";"Hey."
"Monica";"And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And that’s Chandler."
"Chandler";"How do ya do."
"Tim";"What’s…"
"Monica";"Umm, well, he’s…"
"Joey";"He’s doin’ some thinkin’!"
"Chandler";"What happened? What happened?!"
"Joey";"You kissed my girlfriend!"
"Rachel";"Ooh, I like those sunglasses."
"Ross";"Like ‘em, like ‘em? Or, I’d like to get store credit forthat amount like ‘em?"
"Rachel";"(Swears in Italian, it’s the same term used by Joey earlier andJoey nods his approval.)"
"Monica";"All right everybody, this turkey is ready!"
"Tim";"Where can I wash up?"
"Monica";"Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink,and umm, you can use the fancy soap."
"Tim";"Thank you."
"Rachel";"Fancy soap? I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope!"
"Monica";"See he’s nice. Right?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where youcan actually use the phrase, "That’s not how your dad used to do it.""
"Tim";"Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?"
"Monica";"I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)"
"Rachel";"(pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I’ll get it. (goes over to the door.)"
"Chandler";"Gotcha! (laughs)"
"Joey";"That doesn’t sound like thinking to me!"
"Chandler";"Sorry!"
"Joey";"Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there! Ithink you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!"
"Chandler";"Okay, okay, you got it!"
"Rachel";"Ross, can you pass me the yams?"
"Ross";"Sure! Oh, and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchangethem."
"Rachel";"Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!"
"Monica";"Oh-ho-ho, we’ve got company."
"Ross";"There’s nothing the matter with me. See, I’m not completelydevoid of sentiment, see I have feelings."
"Rachel";"Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)"
"Chandler";"You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension bymooning you guys!"
"Joey";"All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it,all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, thenyou should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!"
"Chandler";"You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I wantyou to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight."
"Joey";"So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?"
"Chandler";"Absolutely!"
"Joey";"That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?(There’s no response from Chandler.) Okay."
"Rachel";"Don’t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Rosswhat’s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshellfrom the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from themuseum from the first time we… were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,but I keep the things that matter!"
"Ross";"I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry. Though, you’re notsupposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It’s like a million years old, we, weactually, we had people looking for that."
"Monica";"(putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)"
"Tim";"Here, let me help. (Does so.)"
"Monica";"Thank you."

"Phoebe";"No."
"Monica";"Y’know what, let’s do the catering business."

"Rachel";"Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God."
"Mrs. Lynch";"I didn’t realize that she was so close."

"Rachel";"Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothingabout an assistant buyer?"
"Mrs. Lynch";"(starting to cry) No, I’m sorry. I have to go. (She leaves asSophie arrives.)"

"Sophie";"I sure did! (smiles)"
"Allesandro";"I’m so excited about having Monica come on board with us.Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it’s like losing a member ofthe family. Of course, that"

"Phoebe";"Oh, which museum?"
"Phoebe";"(just Phoebe) No, answer his."
"Ross";"Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near thedoor, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at mymercy."
"Chandler";"Were you so late because you were burring this woman?"
"Ross";"No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. Sheseems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hoursaway."
"Chandler";"How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at theyall look at him) That joke would’ve killed in Albany."
"Joey";"Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now? (He smiles and has cookieremains all over his teeth.)"
"Chandler";"Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They’re lighting the bigChristmas tree tonight."
"Phoebe";"Umm, that paper’s two weeks old."
"Chandler";"All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I reallywanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it."
"Rachel";"Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I"
"Chandler";"Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling."
"Rachel";"Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung."
"Joey";"Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas."
"Chandler";"Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do youwant me to set you up?"
"Rachel";"Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve beensingle. How come you never offered this before?"
"Chandler";"Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longerfeel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy."
"Rachel";"Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t likeguys with boring jobs."
"Chandler";"Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?"
"All";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"What’s wrong Mon?"
"Monica";"Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me."
"Phoebe";"Oh."
"Monica";"I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, Iget off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef’shat. (The hat says ‘Quit, bitch’)"
"Phoebe";"Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’"
"Rachel";"Hey, honey! What’s the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, Iwas just trying to be nice! Whoa!"
"Monica";"I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and theyhad to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs andMonica glares at him.)"
"Joey";"Ohhh!"
"Monica";"I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit,and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting formy whole life."
"Rachel";"Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yellat them? Or, fire them?"
"Monica";"I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you knowthat I’m not good at confrontation."
"Chandler";"Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director,I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just sohe could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss."
"Joey";"Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?"
"Monica";"That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?"
"Joey";"Good enough to get fired."
"Monica";"All right, you’re hired!"
"Joey";"Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guydirect"
"Chandler";"(he glares at him for a while) Yes."
"Chandler";"I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him)Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’mnot gay, I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!"
"Drew";"I didn’t think you were gay. I do now."
"Chandler";"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up."
"Drew";"Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I’m not looking for anything serious."
"Chandler";"Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of afling, that might be all right with Rachel."
"Mike";"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmasparty, Rachel?"
"Chandler";"(to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name."
"Mike";"Oh wow! I’m free for her!"
"Drew";"Oh, wait a second! I didn’t say I wasn’t free!"
"Mike";"Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger gametomorrow?"
"Drew";"Hold on, y’know I"
"Chandler";"Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care tostay, but sure!"
"Mike";"Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batchBasel Hadens."
"Chandler";"Well, I don’t really know what that is, but"
"Phoebe";"Hey! You guys, I’m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you wantto hear it?"
"Phoebe";"(singing)"
"Rachel";"Pheebs, that’s great!"

"Joey";"What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail.Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole."
"Phoebe";"All good, thanks. (to Rachel) Do you maybe have a nickname have like anickname that’s easier to rhyme?"

"Joey";"Sure! Where are the seats?"
"Chandler";"Wherever! I’ve got like 20!"
"Rachel";"So, will I like any of these guys?"
"Chandler";"Y’know what, I’m gonna uh, play the field just a littlemore."
"Rachel";"Chandler!"
"Chandler";"Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?"
"Phoebe";"(shocked) You work with robots!!"
"Chandler";"(pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, there’s this one guy, Patrick, Ithink you’re gonna like him, he’s really nice, he’s funny, he’s aswimmer."
"Rachel";"Ohh, I like swimmer’s bodies!"
"Chandler";"Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of creditcards."
"Rachel";"Op, I like credit cards!"
"Chandler";"See, I’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?"
"Rachel";"Well, so what does he do?"
"Chandler";"Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division."
"Rachel";"Your company has a fine foods division?"
"Chandler";"It’s a big company, I don’t—if you—I…"
"Joey";"Now, wait a second! You make food"
"Phoebe";"No! No, the robots just work for them."
"Monica";"(getting up) All right, I’m gonna go to work. Does anybody have aproblem with that?"
"Joey";"Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!"
"Monica";"You want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!"
"Joey";"Oh, what are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?"
"Monica";"You bet your ass, I’m gonna fire you! Thank you."
"Ross";"Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight."
"Chandler";"Oh yeah! With who?"
"Ross";"You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?"
"Chandler";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decidebetween the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s atwo hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But thisother girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, wellshe’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s"
"Phoebe";"If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?"
"Ross";"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives soclose. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something thatwas—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding,she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist."
"Joey";"(entering) Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey, man!"
"Phoebe";"Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?"
"Joey";"(checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)"
"Joey";"(entering from the dining room) Hey."
"Monica";"Hey."
"Joey";"Hey, what happened to your fancy chef’s jacket? (sees there’s aburn spot on it)"
"Monica";"They baked it. I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna call ameeting tonight, I’m gonna fire you tonight."
"Joey";"You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happensto be over her breast.)"
"Monica";"What are you doing?!"
"Joey";"It’s still a tiny bit on fire there."
"Monica";"Thanks. (Joey’s still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!"
"Rachel";"(entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!"
"Chandler";"Well, like father, like son."
"Rachel";"Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think thiscould maybe turn into something serious."
"Chandler";"Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? Ithought you were looking for some kind of a fling."
"Rachel";"Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didn’t tell him that, though?Right?"
"Chandler";"Ummmmmmmm, no."
"Rachel";"You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tellthe guy that!"
"Chandler";"Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was justlooking to get—oh I see."
"Rachel";"Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me puttingout on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea."
"Monica";"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?"
"Joey";"Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. SinceI don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool worknickname."
"A Waiter";"(entering) Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday.(hands him two envelopes)"
"Joey";"(opening an envelope) There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks inthis one!"
"The Waiter";"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it neverhurts to wear tight trousers."
"Monica";"Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials?Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why isnobody writing these down?"
"The Waiter";"Because we can remember them."
"Monica";"Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them likeyou did the other night?"
"The Waiter";"Well, sure, that too."
"Monica";"Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here’s thething, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positiveatmosphere…"
"The Waiter";"Can’t hear you!"
"Monica";"(louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (Sheholds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be"
"Joey";"No ma’am."
"The Waiter";"Hey! He has a name, it’s Dragon. Do you wanna know your name?Check your hat. (to another waiter) We did the hat right? (The other waiter nods yes.)"
"Monica";"What the hell happened?!"
"Joey";"I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing therewith 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking,"Wow! It’s been a long time since I had… (tries to do the math in his head,but can’t) 327 + 238 dollars!""
"Monica";"Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’vegot to fire you!"
"Joey";"And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me,instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nicethings I’ve been saying about you."
"Monica";"What kinda things have you been saying?"
"Joey";"Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in."
"Phoebe";"(singing) Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry…"
"Chandler";"(interrupting) Oh, y’know, y’know what Pheebs?"
"Phoebe";"What?"
"Chandler";"I’m not Jewish, so…"
"Phoebe";"So! Ross doesn’t"
"Chandler";"Bad dream?"
"Ross";"I wasn’t sleeping."
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe’s song about?"
"Ross";"The one with the cat. I gotta go, I’ve got another date."
"Phoebe";"So, did you pick one yet?"
"Ross";"No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was adifferent joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn."
"Phoebe";"Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown andyou’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just endthem both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on yourway back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’redone!"
"Ross";"Y’know, you’re right. Thank you."
"Phoebe";"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague."
"Chandler";"Prague?"
"Phoebe";"There’s sooo much you don’t know."
"Rachel";"Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you nottell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?"
"Chandler";"I did! I absolutely did!"
"Rachel";"You idiot!!"
"Chandler";"I’m sure you’re right, but why?"
"Rachel";"You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a seriousrelationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!"
"Chandler";"Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry."
"Rachel";"Y’know, you should"
"Chandler";"I know! I know!"
"Rachel";"Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Beingalone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)"
"Chandler";"Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody!You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, Ididn’t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)"
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Chandler";"Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?"
"Rachel";"No."
"Chandler";"Oh, it doesn’t matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey,y’know what, I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game, you wanna comewith me?"
"Rachel";"Cute guys in little shorts? Sure."
"Chandler";"Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadianswith no teeth."
"Rachel";"Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)"
"Chandler";"Have you ever been with a woman?"
"Rachel";"What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!"
"Chandler";"So there is no good time to ask that question."
"The Conductor";"The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!"
"Monica";"I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get mesome more swordfish?"
"Kitchen Worker";"I don’t speak English."
"Monica";"You did a minute ago!"
"Kitchen Worker";"Well, I don’t know what to tell ya!"
"Monica";"Fine!"
"Monica";"Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I’m cold!(She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the dooropens)"
"The Waiter";"You found that handle, did ya?"
"Monica";"That’s not funny."
"The Waiter";"Well that’s not true."
"Monica";"(starting to cry) I’m a good person. And I’m a good chef, andI don’t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y’know what, if you want meto quit this bad, then all you have to do is…"
"Joey";"(interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Y’know that little speech you madethe other day? Well I got a problem with it!"
"Monica";"You do?"
"Joey";"You bet I do! I just ah, wasn’t listening then, that’s all."
"Monica";"Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!"
"Joey";"What are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?"
"Monica";"You bet your ass I’m gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Getout!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How ‘bout you Chuckles?You think this is funny now?"
"The Waiter";"No."
"Monica";"How about if I"
"The Waiter";"No, it’s really good."
"Monica";"Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker fromearlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!"
"The Conductor";"Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal."
"Ross";"(waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sittingnext to him)"
"Woman On Train";"I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now thatI see them, I win."
"Ross";"What?"
"Woman On Train";"We’re at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?"
"Ross";"(now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!"
"Woman On Train";"Yes we are. So, coffee?"
"Ross";"Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?"
"Woman On Train";"Oh, no. But it’s just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia."
"Joey";"Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before Italked back to chef Geller!"
"Monica";"Thanks."
"Joey";"Yep! Looks like it’s gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragonhouse this year."
"Monica";"Enough!"
"Joey";"(leaving) Lean-lean-lean!"
"Phoebe";"(singing) ""
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! I can’t believe my little brother is married!"
"Frank";"Oh I know!! (Both he and Alice squeal hysterically)"
"Phoebe";"You guys, why didn’t you tell me you were eloping?"
"Frank";"‘Cause it just sorta happened, y’know we were at thecourthouse, we were having lunch…"
"Phoebe";"Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?"
"Frank";"We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like,"Hey! Y'know, we’re here, having lunch let’s get married!"
"Phoebe";"Wow, a year and a half ago I didn’t even know I had a brother, andnow I have a sister too. (They all hug, and Frank and Alice start kissing.) Okay. Okay.Stop it, don’t. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?"
"Frank";"Uhh, yeah."
"Alice";"We’ve been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we gotengaged, we thought we’d get a jump on things, y’know no one’s getting anyyounger."
"Frank";"See the thing is umm, we’re not able to y’know, uh, conceive."
"Alice";"And we’ve tried everything, we’ve seen a bunch of doctors."
"Frank";"Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a babyis that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it intoanother girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into."
"Phoebe";"(shocked) That’s a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravyboat."
"Joey";"(entering with Ross) Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! (He’swearing a blue blazer) Guess which job I got."
"Chandler";"I don’t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black."
"Ross";"What?"
"Chandler";"Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back."
"Rachel";"But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?"
"Chandler";"Well, you-you know what I meant."
"Monica";"No, you messed it up. You’re stupid."
"Chandler";"So what job did you get Joe?"
"Joey";"Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me."
"Rachel";"Well, how can you be a tour guide, don’t you have to be a dinosaurexpert or something?"
"Joey";"No, not really. They give you all the information, it’s uh, it’slike memorizing a script. (Making like a tour guide) "And on your left, you haveTyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period."
"Ross";"Uh actually Joey, it’s the Cretasous period."
"Joey";"Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey!!"
"All";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!"
"All";"Oh my God!!"
"Phoebe";"And! And, they’re gonna have a baby! (The gang is shocked.) And!And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. (The gang is stunned into silence.)"
"Ross";"My God!"
"Monica";"Are you serious?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah"
"Joey";"You’re really thinking about having sex with your brother?!"
"Phoebe";"Ewww! And "Oh no!" It’s—they just want me to be thesurrogate. It’s her-it’s her egg and her sperm, and I’m-I’m just theoven, it’s totally their bun."
"Joey";"Huh."
"Monica";"What did you tell them?"
"Phoebe";"Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there tothink about? I’m gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give."
"Chandler";"You’re gonna be carrying their baby and give them a"
"Rachel";"Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there arethings to think about."
"Monica";"Yeah, like you’re gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant."
"Phoebe";"I know!"
"Ross";"Pheebs, you’re talking about putting your body through an awful lot,I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it’s all for somebody else!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, what’s your point?"
"Ross";"Well, the stuff I just mentioned."
"Rachel";"Wow! I don’t know if I could ever do that. I always figured thefirst time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a…keeper."
"Phoebe";"Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denimfurniture."
"Joey";"No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we’ll be supportivelike crazy."
"All";"Yeah."
"Monica";"We just want you to think it through."
"Rachel";"Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who’s had a baby. Likeyour mom?"
"Phoebe";"My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did."
"Kathy";"Umm, (moves her hand’s down to his butt) I love this touchy. Can Itake it to work with me?"
"Chandler";"Oh, yeah, sure, it’s not mine anyway. It can with the pants."
"Kathy";"Oh! (They kiss and she leaves)"
"Monica";"I am so jealous."
"Rachel";"You guys are really right…there aren’t you?"
"Chandler";"Yes. Right where?"
"Monica";"In the beginning where y’know it’s all sex and talking and sexand talking and…"
"Chandler";"Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking."
"Monica";"And the sex?"
"Chandler";"All right, we haven’t had sex yet. Okay, what’s the bigdeal? Y’know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to thenext level."
"Rachel";"Oh, Chandler that is so nice."
"Ross";"That is really nice…lying! No way is that the reason!"
"Rachel";"Why? Just because you’re not mature enough to understand somethinglike that?!"
"Chandler";"No, he’s right, I’m totally lying."
"Monica";"Then what is it?"
"Chandler";"Well, Kathy’s last boyfriend was Joey."
"Ross";"And you’re afraid you won’t be able to…fill his shoes."
"Chandler";"No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him."
"Ross";"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor."
"Chandler";"Yes, and I was saying the actual words."
"Monica";"So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’tmean he’s great in bed."
"Chandler";"We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likesto agree with him a lot."
"Monica";"Sweetie, with you it’s gonna be different. The sex is gonna begreat, ‘cause you-you guys are in love."
"Chandler";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"Just go for it Chandler."
"Monica";"Yeah, you should."
"Rachel";"Yeah, you should, really."
"Monica";"Go on."
"Chandler";"All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. ButI’m just doing it for you guys."
"Joey";"Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period."
"Smart Kid";"Isn’t the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?"
"Joey";"Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, (Motions to afossilised dinosaur foot.) we have a large foot. (Sees Ross working in one of the displaycases.) Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. (Knocks on the glass) Everyone wave‘Hi’ to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard atwork. (Ross does the old "Putting a cigarette in your ear and pulling it out of yourmouth trick.") Okay, moving right along. Come on."
"Phoebe Sr";"It’s open! Come in!"
"Phoebe";"Hi!"
"Phoebe Sr";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"I’m sorry, I’m late."
"Phoebe Sr";"Oh, that’s okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples."
"Phoebe";"Wow! You really go all out when you’re expecting company."
"Phoebe Sr";"No, I was working on my pottery."
"Phoebe";"Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn’t know that you did…pot."
"Phoebe Sr";"Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery anderotica."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, erotiery!"
"Phoebe Sr";"Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I justthought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person.Y’know…"
"Phoebe";"Okay."
"Phoebe Sr";"I really don’t think it’s a very good idea, Phoebe."
"Phoebe";"Why not?"
"Phoebe Sr";"Well, because you’d be giving up a baby, and I-I reallydon’t—I don’t know if there’s anything I can say that could make youunderstand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm, (Picks up a puppy in the box next to thecouch.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don’t-don’t hurt thepuppy."
"Phoebe Sr";"No-no-no, the-the puppy’s yours."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I get a puppy!!"
"Phoebe Sr";"Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days."
"Phoebe";"Why?"
"Phoebe Sr";"I realise I don’t have any right to start get all parenty on youand everything now, but umm, (Sees that Phoebe isn’t paying attention and is busymimicking the puppy.) uhh… Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy,it’s very important."
"Phoebe";"Okay."
"Phoebe Sr";"I mean, I know what I’m talking about. I gave up two babies, andI only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terribleit is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret everysingle day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, itwould be like a million times harder to give up a child. (Phoebe is playing with the puppyagain, and not listening) I really shouldn’t have given you the puppy first."
"Phoebe";"All right, I’m sorry."
"Joey";"Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I’m-I’m saving this for myfriend Ross."
"Tour Guide";"You mean Dr. Geller?"
"Joey";"Doctor? Wow! I didn’t know he had a nickname."
"Tour Guide";"Oh, he won’t sit here. Only the people in the white coats sitover there, (Points to there table) and only the people in the blue blazers sit here."
"Joey";"Well, how-how come?"
"Tour Guide";"That’s just the way it is."
"Joey";"That’s crazy."
"Tour Guide";"Maybe it’s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coatsand blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist inthe classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, butnow…(Turns around) Peter! Hey, Peter! It’s me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared mypuddin’ which you man! I gave you my"
"Joey";"I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you. Anyway,look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross isone of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he"
"Ross";"That’s okay, I’m cool over here. I’ll catch up with youlater, Joey. (Joey is shocked.)"
"Tour Guide";"Op, this is saved. (Joey wonders why) Gift shop."
"Ross";"(entering) Hey, uh, I’m really, really sorry about what happened inthe cafeteria today."
"Joey";"It’s no big deal. Hey, y’know, you do what you gotta do. Right?"
"Ross";"But hey, it’s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides"
"Joey";"Whatever."
"Ross";"It’s like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Whereyou work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the otherchefs, right?"
"Monica";"I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me."
"Joey";"Look, Ross, really it’s-it’s no big deal. Y’know you wear awhite coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then sobe it. Y’know, hey I understand. Y’know? Hey, when I’m in a play andyou’re in the audience, I don’t talk to you, right? So it’s y’know,it’s uh, it’s cool. I’ll see you tomorrow. (Leaves)"
"Rachel";"Yeah, when we’re in the audience he doesn’t talk to us, but hedoes wave."
"Chandler";"Hi."
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?"
"Phoebe";"Ooh, y’know what, I think it’s time for puppy to go out again.Come on, let’s go to the balcony."
"Monica";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"Umm, the street. Come on, let’s go to the street. Ooh, listen,don’t go onto the balcony until after I get back. (Leaves)"
"Monica";"(to Chandler) So, did you do it?"
"Chandler";"Yes, yes, we had the sex."
"Monica";"Uh-oh, it was bad?"
"Chandler";"It was fine, y’know? But she didn’t agree with me asstrongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, I’m allright with it.""
"Monica";"Well, it was the first time. Y’know, there’s not always a lotof agreement the first time."
"Rachel";"Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that."
"Chandler";"Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with awoman, y’know, I know where everything goes, it’s always nice. But I need toknow what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebody’s killing her inthere!""
"Monica";"All right, I’m gonna show you something a lot of guys don’tknow. Rach, give me that pad, please? (She does so and Monica starts drawing on it) Allright. Now…"
"Chandler";"Look, you don’t have to draw an actual wo—whoa! She’shot!"
"Monica";"Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labellingthem) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there’s more thanthree), five, six, and seven!"
"Chandler";"(shocked) There are seven?!"
"Rachel";"Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah."
"Chandler";"(Points to one) That’s one?"
"Monica";"It’s kind of an important one!"
"Chandler";"Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down."
"Rachel";"Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what thatcould’ve meant.)"
"Monica";"(continuing) Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and setup camp."
"Chandler";"That-that’s bad?"
"Rachel";"Well if you go to"
"Chandler";"Well you might if it were anything like 7!"
"Monica";"All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit‘em all, and you mix ‘em up. You gotta keep them on their toes."
"Rachel";"Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)"
"Monica";"All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,6-7, 7, …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…(mouths 7)! (They both leanback on the couch satisfied.)"
"Older Scientist";"Dr. Geller, there’s a seat over here. (Motions toan empty chair at the ‘white’ table.)"
"Ross";"Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I’m having my lunch at this table, herein the middle. I’m having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he’llsit with me."
"Joey";"(standing up) I will sit with you Dr. Geller. (He goes over to his tableand they shake hands.)"
"Ross";"Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is somethingunnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’knowwhat I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people inblue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-thesecoats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. (He takes off his coatand throws it down.) I’m Ross! I’m divorced, and I have a kid!"
"Joey";"(stands up, and throws his coat on the floor) I’m Joey! I’m anactor! I don’t know squat about dinosaurs!"
"Another Tour Guide";"(standing up and removing his coat) I’m Ted, and I justmoved here a month ago, and New York really scares me."
"Ross";"All right, there you go!"
"Joey";"Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!"
"Older Scientist";"I’m Andrew, and I didn’t pay for this pear."
"Ross";"Okay, good-good for you."
"Tour Guide";"I’m Rhonda, (motions to her breasts) and these aren’treal! (Joey and Ross look at each other, shocked)"
"Ross";"Wow, Rhonda."
"Another Scientist";"I’m Scott."

"Dr. Zane";"Um-hmm, five actually."
"Phoebe";"Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under thestairs?"
"Dr. Zane";"We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one willattach."
"Phoebe";"That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75percent chance of no baby at all!"
"Frank";"Hey, y’know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if youstuff like 200 of them in there?"
"Alice";"Sweety, now, she’s a woman, not a gumball machine."

"Ross";"Correct. Rachel claims"
"Ross";"Correct. Her actual favorite movie is..."

"Rachel";"What?!"
"Monica";"Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!"
"Chandler";"I knew it!"
"Rachel";"I don’t care, I’m not going anywhere."
"Chandler";"Cool, girl roommate."
"Monica";"Well?"
"Phoebe";"Nope, not knocked up yet."

"Alice";"So umm, you feel like taking a test? There’s only one question."
"Phoebe";"All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y’know just remember thatit’s still really early, okay so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, thatdoesn’t mean that I’m not gonna"
"Alice";"Okay."
"Frank";"Okay. (They both squeal in expectation.)"
"Phoebe";"Great. (Goes to take the test.)"
"Rachel";"Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!"
"Joey";"Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!"
"Rachel";"That is not true. She did! She forced me!"
"Monica";"Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the questionwrong!"
"Rachel";"Well it stupid, unfair question!"
"Ross";"Don’t blame the questions!"

"Joey";"But it is our apartment!"
"Rachel";"No it’s not!"
"Phoebe";"You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonnahave a baby!"

"Rachel";"Oh, I think I saw some in here."
"Monica";"What is it?!"
"Rachel";"I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’lldie."
"Monica";"I can’t believe we’re living here!"
"Chandler";"What?! What-what is it?!"
"Joey";"Did you see the size of the closets?!"
"Chandler";"I can’t believe we live here!"
"Chandler and Joey";"Awwwww!! (They lean back all the way.) Awwwwwww!!!"
"Chandler";"Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is"
"Ross";"People can hear you."
"Chandler";"I know!!"
"Chandler";"Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Kathy's Co-Star";"Hi!"
"Kathy";"Hi!"
"Ross";"That is one good looking man!"
"Chandler";"Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!"
"Kathy's Co-Star";"Sooo, you’ve been doing this long?"
"Kathy";"No, you’re my first. Put the money on the table."
"Kathy's Co-Star";"Oh, yeah! Ooh, that’s nice. (They start making outharder.)"
"Ross";"Dude!"
"Kathy's Co-Star";"Is that an expensive blouse?"
"Kathy";"If you want it to be."
"Ross";"Here’s your girlfriend’s button. (Holding the button.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses fromhigh school?"
"Monica";"Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?"
"Phoebe";"Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive."
"Monica";"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. Ifyou could just…(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)…throw your purses atit."
"Monica";"Oh my God, are you out of a job?"
"Rachel";"No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a"
"Phoebe";"Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snootyrich people and tell them what to buy?"
"Rachel";"Uh-huh."
"Phoebe";"That sounds great!"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)"
"Monica";"Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are foodanymore, that-that gravy train had ended."
"Joey";"(Holding a turkey leg) There’s gravy?"
"Monica";"If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming overall the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now.(She takes back the turkey leg)"
"Monica";"What are you doing?"
"Joey";"I think I left a donut up here."
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh! How was Kathy’s play?"
"Ross";"Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real goodlookin’ guy."
"Chandler";"Yeah, it’s like someone"
"Chandler";"I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy onstage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’sgonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, "So where’s yourboyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?" And she’ll go, "No-no-no,it’s Chandler." And he’ll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!""
"Joey";"(to Ross) That-that is a good trick."
"Chandler";"All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?"
"Joey";"Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I meanjust ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t meanit’s gonna happen with them."
"Ross";"Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger."
"Joey";"Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman."
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood."
"Ross";"They’re not a couple!"
"Phoebe";"Oh-okay, I get the game now."
"Joey";"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it onstage, was it like really hot?"
"Ross";"Oh yeah!"
"Joey";"Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors areactually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as longas it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goesaway, that’s when you’re in trouble."
"Chandler";"Really?"
"Joey";"Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I everhad chemistry on stage?"
"Ross";"No."
"Joey";"Noooo!!"
"Chandler";"So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?"
"Ross";"Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see howhot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I know but…"
"Ross";"Oh no-no-no, I’m there."
"Monica";"(entering) Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?"
"Monica";"You made pancakes?"
"Joey";"Yep! Grab a plate."
"Monica";"Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive herpancakes.)"
"Joey";"No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, whichflies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin’ closer."
"Chandler";"Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals,muffins, waffles,"
"Joey";"Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturdaynight, if people want to come over."
"Ross";"Oh yeah!"
"Monica";"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game."
"Joey";"Oh yeah, who’s playing?"
"Monica";"The players."
"Ross";"Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess."
"Monica";"(laughs) Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is."
"Joey";"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!"
"Phoebe";"Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on herplate.)"
"Rachel";"(on the phone) Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year oldwoman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling youI’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes Iam! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when youget this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ahreally need to talk to you."
"Mr. Waltham";"In a moment, please, I’m in the middle of a task. And you havea customer."
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Joshua";"Hi, I’m Joshua."
"Rachel";"Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?"
"Joshua";"Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my"
"Rachel";"Oh, I’m so sorry."
"Joshua";"Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. Thissuit and what turned out to be a skirt."
"Rachel";"Well, at least that’s a great suit."
"Joshua";"Yeah, but it wasn’t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners inthe skirt. (Rachel laughs) So I need everything down to underwear, so if you’rewilling, I’m all yours."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Mr. Waltham";"Rachel, you needed to speak to me?"
"Rachel";"No-no, that wasn’t me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Letme show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry."
"Rachel";"Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way. (Motions to thecorrect way.)"
"Joshua";"It’s this way? Sorry. (He walks past her and she again admires hisbutt.)"
"Chandler";"I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them.Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joeytold us what this means!"
"Ross";"All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There wassome sexual chemistry between them."
"Chandler";"Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!"
"Ross";"Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’tbe…y'know you."
"Kathy";"Hey you guys!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Kathy";"Hi! (Kisses Chandler) Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like ittonight?"
"Ross";"Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)"
"Kathy";"Wasn’t Nick funny when he couldn’t get his match lit?"
"Kathy";"It’s a good play, isn’t it?"
"Chandler";"Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and"
"Ross";"Okay, I… (Walks away.)"
"Kathy";"Clearly, I’m having sex with him?"
"Chandler";"Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!"
"Kathy";"Okay, so let me just get this straight. You’re accusing me ofcheating on you, and insulting my performance?"
"Chandler";"Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’reup there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing."
"Kathy";"Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I’m-I’m playing a part in aplay! How can you not trust me?!"
"Chandler";"Well, you can understand, given how we started."
"Kathy";"Oh, wow. I can’t believe you’re throwing that in my face."
"Chandler";"Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denyingthis!"
"Kathy";"I’ll tell you what, Chandler, why don’t you call me when yougrow up!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, well, don’t expect"
"Rachel";"I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came overtoday, and I got to dress him up all day!"
"Phoebe";"Rachel has a new doll."
"Rachel";"Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump themtogether and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realisedit, Joshua! Josh-"
"Ross";"Uh, hello!"
"Rachel";"Hi-e!!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh, what do I smell?"
"Joey";"I don’t know, it smells good."
"Monica";"Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment)"
"Monica";"Please, have some!"
"Ross";"Oh, yumm!"
"Monica";"Yeah, I’ve just been fiddling around in here making delicioustreats for everyone."
"Joey";"(Holding a magazine) Wow! The new"
"Monica";"Yeah, it’s just something I picked up."
"Ross";"Cookies and porn, you’re the best mom ever!!"
"Phoebe";"What? What?"
"Rachel";"Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to bethere."
"Ross";"Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?"
"Rachel";"It’s Joshua."
"Ross";"Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to hisapartment. Joey follows him)"
"Monica";"Wait! Wait! This isn’t take-out!"
"Phoebe";"(getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but…"
"Monica";"No, wait, please don’t go! I’ve got porn for you too!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I don’t need it."
"Monica";"People are supposed to wanna hang out here!"
"Rachel";"Why? Honey, what is the big deal?"
"Monica";"I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! Imean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls broughttheir dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air."
"Phoebe";"Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyonehas to hang out in the big apartment?"
"Monica";"‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. ButI’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough."
"Phoebe";"If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang outhere!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, that’s true."
"Monica";"All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna beten times better than that place!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, are we gonna trash that place?"
"Chandler";"Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking atthe new"
"All";"What?!"
"Ross";"So you were right?"
"Chandler";"I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it! (Pause) I don’tlive here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)"
"Ross";"Chandler!"
"Rachel";"Chandler, what did she say?"
"Phoebe";"Wait a minute."
"Joey";"Come here."
"Monica";"Are you sure?"
"Chandler";"Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to"
"Chandler";"Yes! See you and I have always been like—(motions that they thinkthe same.)"
"Rachel";"Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey’s.) Oh, hey, do youneed help with that?"
"Monica";"Nah, I got it."
"Rachel";"Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler andJoey’s.)"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"All";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.It’s just so frustrating!"
"Phoebe";"Why don’t you ask him out?"
"Joey";"Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!"
"Rachel";"Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?"
"Joey";"Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on."
"Phoebe";"He just got a divorce right?"
"Rachel";"Hmm-mmm."
"Phoebe";"So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, youjust have to make the first move."
"Rachel";"Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before."
"Phoebe";"(shocked) You’ve never asked a guy out?!!"
"Rachel";"No. Have you?"
"Phoebe";"Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?"
"Rachel";"I don’t even know how I would go about it."
"Joey";"Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,"Hey, how you doin’?""
"Phoebe";"Oh, please!"
"Joey";"(to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin’?"
"Rachel";"You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, andI’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin’?(Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from"
"Phoebe";"I’ve never done that."
"Rachel";"Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no."
"Joey";"Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh,Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll sayyes!"
"Rachel";"Really?! You think that will work?"
"Joey";"Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?"
"Joey";"What the heck is that?"
"Chandler";"Did she call?"
"Phoebe";"No, sorry."
"Chandler";"All right, maybe I should call her."
"Joey";"No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!"
"Ross";"He’s right, what she did was unforgivable."
"Chandler";"Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?"
"Ross";"How might you be wrong?"
"Chandler";"Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?"
"Joey";"Dude, tell me she actually told you this."
"Chandler";"She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat.Back me up here, Ross!"
"Ross";"That’s all you’re basing this on?"
"Chandler";"That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage andthe heat, and the onstage and the oy heat."
"Joey";"Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theoriesthat didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry."
"Chandler";"Oh my God!!"
"Rachel";"Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) Youknow, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too… (Tries again.)Umm, who likes the Knicks—(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)"
"Joshua";"What do you think?"
"Rachel";"Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!"
"Joshua";"Huh. (She starts brushing the lint off and checking him out in themirror.) Yeah?"
"Rachel";"Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks howthey would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you likeit?"
"Joshua";"I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I’m gonna wear it home."
"Rachel";"Great."
"Joshua";"All right, thank you so much for all your help."
"Rachel";"Sure."
"Joshua";"Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it."
"Rachel";"Yeah-eah-ha!"
"Joshua";"Thanks. (He starts to leave) Maybe I’ll see in the spring, with theuh, y’know, for the uh, bathing suits."
"Rachel";"Oh well, you don’t want to do that now?!"
"Joshua";"Ah, that’s okay, thanks."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Joshua";"Anyway, hopefully, I’ll see you around sometime. (He goes out thedoor.)"
"Rachel";"Basketball!"
"Joshua";"(coming back in) I’m sorry."
"Rachel";"I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’reinterested, just as a thank you for this week."
"Joshua";"Wow! That would be great."
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Joshua";"Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks!This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel. (He takes the tickets and leaves as Mr.Waltham returns.)"
"Mr. Waltham";"Good morning."
"Joshua";"Hi!"
"Kathy";"(opening the door) Hey."
"Chandler";"Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry.Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completelyunderstand why you were so upset."
"Kathy";"Oh wow. I really wish you’d call me."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is agood thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on.Y’know, I know for me—(Notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.)Nick’s pants?"
"Kathy";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a"
"Joey";"Okay, for next time, what do you say?"
"Rachel";"I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have anextra ticket."
"Ross";"So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?"
"Rachel";"He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I gotthe date, I’m just not on it!"
"Monica";"(entering) Okay, it’s ready. Come on."
"Joey";"What’s ready?"
"Monica";"Just come."
"Ross";"Oh my God!"
"Rachel";"Wow! Monica!"
"Phoebe";"Great!"
"Ross";"This is beautiful!"
"Phoebe";"Oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?"
"Monica";"Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?"
"Joey";"I don’t know, it looks the same."
"Monica";"You used to have carpet."
"Joey";"Oh yeah!"
"Monica";"So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I’m just gonna restmy eyes just a little bit."
"Ross";"Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?"
"Monica";"Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I’m always thehostess."
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Joey";"How’d it go?"
"Chandler";"Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him."
"Phoebe";"Oh good!"
"Chandler";"She is now."
"Ross";"What are you saying?"
"Chandler";"I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I meanyou think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, withhis rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I"
"Phoebe";"How? How is your fault?"
"Chandler";"Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just calledher after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and theywould’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!"
"Rachel";"Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, itdoes not justify her sleeping with someone."
"Ross";"Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…"
"Mr. Waltham";"Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. AJoshua Bergen."
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Mr. Waltham";"Will you call him?"
"Rachel";"Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license andholds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in"
"Phoebe";"(holding a lure) So now, what is this now?"
"Joey";"Guggly worm."
"Phoebe";"(laughs and picks up another lure) And this?"
"Joey";"Glow-pop giggly jammer."
"Phoebe";"(laughs harder) You make it so funny."
"Monica";"(not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, what’sthis?"
"Joey";"(examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops thesandwich)"

"Joey";"(going over and picking up the rod) That’s all right. Hey you guys,you know what’s going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad getsme out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing withyour life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I’m doing a movie with Charlton Hestondad. What are you doing with your life?""
"All";"Great!"
"Chandler";"You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here.Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandlergoes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)"
"Monica";"Hey, Joey, I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. Imean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishingnext week?"
"Joey";"Look, there’s nothing I can do for him right now, he’s still inhis sweat pants, that’s still Phase One. Y'know? I’ll be back for Phase Two, Iwould never miss Phase Two."
"Monica";"What’s Phase Two?"
"Joey";"Gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club."
"Rachel";"How does going to a strip club help him better?"
"Ross";"Because there are naked ladies there."
"Joey";"Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women."
"Ross";"There are naked ladies there too."
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"(opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Wouldyou give me one minute!! Please."
"Joshua";"So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?"

"Monica";"I don’t know sweetie."
"Rachel";"No! Help me!"
"Monica";"I can’t! I have to work!"
"Rachel";"Phoebe?"
"Phoebe";"I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening."

"Phoebe";"Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me."
"Rachel";"Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is—I have to meet Joshua! Thisis my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y’know the "Wouldn’t it begreat if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?"

"Rachel";"Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.)Emily?"
"Emily";"Yes."

"Emily";"Thank goodness."
"Rachel";"There’s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out thatI’m not free tonight. So…"
"Emily";"Really?! Well, that’s just lovely, isn’t it? I must’vemissed your call, even though I didn’t leave the flat all day."
"Rachel";"Oh well, no I…"
"Emily";"Oh, no-no-no, that’s not rude! It’s perfectly in keeping with atrip that I’ve already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and beenstrip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someonewho’s got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum."
"Monica";"I-I-I think you look great."
"Emily";"Good night, it was very nice to meet you all. (Storms out.)"
"Rachel";"I’ll get her."

"Monica";"Oh wait, Joey, you can’t go like that! You stink!"
"Joey";"Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t havetime! They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it."
"Monica";"Yeah. Run ten blocks, that’ll help the smell."
"Rachel";"Hey—whoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joeyruns off.) Wow!"
"Monica";"So? How did it go with Joshua last night?"
"Rachel";"Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night,"
"Monica";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Why?"
"Rachel";"The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I gotthere, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep."
"Phoebe";"Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?"
"Rachel";"No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us andshe was all, "I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!" and he let herright in."
"Monica";"So you hit her in the face?"
"Rachel";"No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to stealmy umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a fewhours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me."
"Phoebe";"(going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs."
"Rachel";"Honey, that’s you’re name."
"Phoebe";"That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we calledeach other!"
"Monica";"Hey! You’re wearing pants!"
"Chandler";"That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk andsee some strippers."
"Monica";"It’s 9:30 in the morning!"
"Chandler";"They got a breakfast buffet."
"Monica";"Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!"
"Chandler";"Ooh, let me talk to him!"
"Monica";"Oh-oh, my God!"
"Chandler";"Well, can I just…"
"Monica";"(to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?"
"Chandler";"She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!"
"Phoebe";"Shhh!! Please! What’s he saying?"
"Monica";"He’s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!"
"Phoebe";"What? Oh my God!"
"Rachel";"What? Who the hell is Emily—(realises) noooo!!"
"Rachel";"They’re in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her armsfranticly and hits Chandler.)"
"Chandler";"Ow!"
"Rachel";"How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hitsChandler again.)"
"Chandler";"Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time."
"Ross";"When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Whowouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes,she was a totally different person."
"Emily";"(rushing in) Ross! Come quickly! There’s a deer just outside eatingfruit from the orchard!"
"Ross";"I’ve gotta go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from theorchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)"
"Monica";"He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from theorchard."
"Rachel";"I don’t get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)"
"Chandler";"Okay, I’m going to go stand over there. (Points and moves intothe living room.)"
"Monica";"Why do you care so much anyway?"
"Rachel";"I don’t care! All right, y’know what I’m just upset thatI’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meetsomeone and go flitting off to Vermont!"
"Monica";"Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail."
"Rachel";"Oh, y’know, would you just for"
"Chandler";"So y’know, uh, when’s he getting back?"
"Monica";"A couple of days."
"Chandler";"Y’know, I knew something like this was going to happen. (Hestarts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)"
"Monica";"What are you doing?! Chandler! You can’t just go back a phase!"
"Chandler";"Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go backin time."
"Phoebe";"Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your PhaseTwo strip club thing with us."
"Monica";"Yeah, come on, we can be guys!"
"Chandler";"(laughs) No you can’t."
"Phoebe";"Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!"
"Chandler";"You don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy andwouldn’t live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)"
"Phoebe";"Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off andyou come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!"
"Chandler";"Okay. (Starts to cry)"
"Phoebe";"I’m sorry. (Goes and hugs him)"
"Joey";"(rushing in) Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I’m here! I’m here!"
"The A.D";"Calm down, we got time, we’re running a little late."
"Joey";"Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!"
"The A.D";"Yeah, we loves ‘em. I’ve never seen him with—(He gets awhiff of Joey and starts smelling around.)"
"Joey";"(trying to act like he’s not the one that stinks.) Whoa! Yeah, whatthe hell is that? What smells so bad?"
"The A.D";"You."
"Joey";"Y’know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know whoI think it is?"
"The A.D";"You?"
"Joey";"No-no, it’s uh, it’s Heston."
"The A.D";"What?"
"Joey";"Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip andthen ate some liquorice."
"The A.D";"There’s no way he smells, he’s the only one around here witha shower in his dressing room."
"Joey";"Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?"
"The A.D";"The one with "Heston" on it."
"Joey";"Interesting."
"Monica";"(coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, I’vegot some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?"
"Chandler";"No thanks, Mom!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, ‘causeI’m pregnant."
"Phoebe";"Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (He leaves.)"
"Monica";"Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancer’s hotpants) so good."
"Phoebe";"(doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic."
"Rachel";"(joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’tcall. I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club.Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!"
"Phoebe";"Come on! Look where you are!!"
"Monica";"(to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris."
"Phoebe";"Remember, a virgin for me please."
"Monica";"Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpetguy."
"Chandler";"Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’mjust gonna go home and call Kathy."
"Phoebe";"Well, if you think it will help."
"Chandler";"No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m gonna get reallydrunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that,I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice"
"Phoebe";"You should! How is she?"
"Chandler";"Ohhh!!"
"Monica";"I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)"
"Charlton Heston";"Hello! Who’s in there? (He opens to curtain to reveal anaked and wet Joey.)"
"Joey";"How ya doin’?"
"Charlton Heston";"Who in the hell are you?"
"Joey";"I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?"
"Charlton Heston";"Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt."
"Joey";"No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I’m an actor, Joey Tribbiani,I’m doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink."
"Charlton Heston";"(shocked) You’re in"
"Joey";"Yeah-yeah, I’m one of the cops that won’t work with you‘cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I’m really sorry, but I stink!"
"Charlton Heston";"Joey, right?"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Charlton Heston";"(tosses him a towel, motions for him to get out of the showerand sits down on the couch) Every actor at one time or another—opp! (Joey tries tosit down next to him and Heston makes him sit somewhere else.) Every actor thinks hestinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won’t evenwatch himself."
"Joey";"Oh no-no-no, you don’t understand…"
"Charlton Heston";"Listen to me!"
"Joey";"Oh yeah, yeah."
"Charlton Heston";"I don’t know one actor worth his salt that didn’t sayat one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there,first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matterhow badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room anduse my shower! Do you understand me?!"
"Joey";"Yes sir! Yes sir, I’m-I’m—(he starts to leave)"
"Charlton Heston";"Wait a minute! Take your pants."
"Joey";"Yeah. Oh, yeah."
"Monica";"So, we did okay at the strip club, right?"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitressthere is quitting to teach the third grade!"
"Rachel";"(entering) I can’t believe it! He still hasn’t called."
"Phoebe";"Who, Josh?"
"Rachel";"It’s Joshua."
"Monica";"What, he doesn’t like Josh?"
"Rachel";"No, I don’t."
"Chandler";"All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on."
"Phoebe";"Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y’know what, you were right, you wereright. We really weren’t great at being guys, but you know why? Because we’regirls."
"Chandler";"Yeah?"
"Phoebe";"And do you know what girls are really good at?"
"Chandler";"Stripping!"
"Phoebe";"No, listening! Sit! Y’know, maybe it would just really, really helpif you would just talk."
"Rachel";"Yeah, come on! What’s going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)"
"Monica";"Yeah. And y’know, if you wanna cry, that’s okay too."
"Chandler";"Okay, look, I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave."
"Monica";"Come on! Chandler!"
"Chandler";"Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay?Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them.(Sits back in disgust.)"
"Monica";"They really were pretty, weren’t they? (Rachel and Phoebe bothagree)"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one."
"Monica";"Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Monica";"Y’know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler isintrigued.) It’d, it’d be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was sopetite."
"Rachel";"See, I don’t know, for me it would have to Chantal."
"Monica";"Oh, Chantal!"
"Rachel";"Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck thatdollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…"
"Chandler";"(jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!"
"Monica";"Really?!"
"Chandler";"I am totally picturing you with all those women!"
"Monica";"That’s-that’s not Phase Three."
"Chandler";"Well, I’m there too!"
"Rachel";"Well, are we all together? Like in a group?"
"Chandler";"Stop it! You’re killing me! I think I just moved on to PhaseFour!"
"Phoebe";"Oh! What is that? What is that?"
"Chandler";"Where I don’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want tohave sex with strippers and my friends!!"
"Chandler";"Come on, let me see that smile."
"Joey";"I don’t wanna."
"Chandler";"Please?"
"Joey";"I wanted to go to the strip club!"
"Chandler";"I know, I know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. Thereare literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over."
"Joey";"Yeah, all right. (Ross enters.)"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey—ooh so, how was Vermont?"
"Ross";"Emily is…incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it,I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.)Oh! And you! Rach!"
"Rachel";"Oh, hey!"
"Ross";"Hey! You were so right!"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Ross";"Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally behappy for each other."
"Rachel";"Oh, hmm."

"Chandler";"All right ladies, here’s what we’re gonna do. (Points to astripper.)"
"Phoebe";"I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her."
"Chandler";"Oh, that’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts."
"Monica";"Wait, now, what am I doing again?"
"Chandler";"Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at anymoment!"
"The Cigarette Guy";"Hi, I’m Joshua, I’m here to pick up Rachel."
"Rachel";"No-no-no, that’ not Joshua."
"Chandler";"What do you want from me, I’ve never met the guy. So anyway,Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy withthe cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a"
"Chandler";"Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And"

"Chandler";"That’s a mailman! That’s"
"Rachel";"Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of aguy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.)"
"Chandler";"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?"
"Rachel";"Hmm."
"Monica";"Joey let me ask you a question."
"Joey";"Ohh, Nothing."
"Monica";"Didn’t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what itdid?"
"Joey";"I"
"Monica";"They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! Howcan you not care?"
"Joey";"Like this. (Shrugs)"
"Rachel";"Well, here’s another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what thatsilver knob on the toilet does?"
"Joey";"Sure! It flushes it."
"Rachel";"Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mindactually using it?"
"Chandler";"(entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!"
"Joey";"Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)"
"Rachel";"Guess who we ran into today?!"
"Monica";"Janice?!"
"Chandler";"Isn’t this amazing?"
"Monica";"How have you been?"
"Janice";"Oh well, I’m divorced."
"Phoebe";"Ohhh, wow."
"Janice";"Yeah, I’m riding the alimony pony. (Does the now famous laugh.)"
"Joey";"And there it is."
"Janice";"I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! (to Chandler) And you,sweetie, I’ll see you tonight."

"Chandler";"B-bye!"
"Janice";"Bye-bye."
"Chandler";"Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After it’s closed) Ican’t stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)"
"Phoebe";"What?! I thought you were crazy about her!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did beforewe fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality—Well, they’re allback! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!"
"Joey";"So what are you doing bringing her here?! There’s people here!"
"Chandler";"Don’t worry about it. I’m taking care of it tonight.(Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)"
"Rachel";"You are not. You have"
"Chandler";"(standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I don’t have to breakup with her this time. We’re not involved! I’m going to do a pre-emptive strike!I’m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes thefridge.)"

"Emily";"Oh my God. I think you’re right."
"Liam";"(puts his arm around her) Well, actually the last time you and I saw eachother was that morning."
"Emily";"Oh, Liam. (Ross laughs and takes her back.)"
"Ross";"Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something—orshould I call it (In an English accent) football?"

"Liam";"Cheers!"
"Ross";"Cheers!"
"Janice";"Oh boy, I just love to sing!"
"Chandler";"Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people werecomplaining though, was that they paid to hear the"
"Janice";"Oh, look at us! Who would’ve thought that Cupid had a station at14th Street Nails. (Does the laugh)"
"Chandler";"(laughs) Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a veryserious relationship…"

"Janice";"When?"
"Chandler";"I don’t know exactly."
"Janice";"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing untilthat moment comes."
"Chandler";"But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow."
"Monica";"Done?"
"Phoebe";"Yep!"
"Rachel";"(entering, with Joey) Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey! What’s up?"
"Monica";"This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off andchecked every outlet. Now, four of them don’t work. Which means, one of"

"Rachel";"Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh,"
"Monica";"Yeah, well, I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybodyready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hearsomething! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises it’s Joey.)"
"Rachel";"It’s coming from Joey!"

"Janice";"(entering) Hey there Ross!"
"Ross";"(shocked) Hey!"
"Phoebe";"(whispering to Ross) Janice."
"Chandler";"Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack."
"Janice";"Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now andthe time you leave is packing, you didn’t really leave me much choice. Did you?"
"Chandler";"Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did"
"Joey";"Hey-hey, what’s going on?"
"Chandler";"Oh, I’m packing. Y’know I’m-I’m packing‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow."
"Joey";"Thanks for telling me!"
"Chandler";"I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s theonly way I can get rid off her."
"Joey";"Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country."
"Janice";"(leaning in from the bedroom) Chandler! Come on, I’m gonna show howto roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It’s a real space saver."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller."
"Janice";"Okay, Chandler, come on!"
"Chandler";"(to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!"
"Joey";"Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I can’t believe you saidyou’d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!"
"Ross";"Hey, I can handle it! All right?"
"Rachel";"Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad."
"Ross";"That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-keptlooking at me."
"Joey";"(pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here.That’s called a scrum, okay? It’s kinda like a huddle."
"Ross";"And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?"
"Joey";"Ross! (Laughs) They’re gonna kill you!"
"Phoebe";"Well, why are you doing this anyway?"
"Ross";"Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. Imean, he’s like Joe Rugby."
"Phoebe";"You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.(Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right."
"Ross";"Anyway, she thought the very"
"Rachel";"(starts laughing, Ross stares at her) I’m sorry. I’m sorry.You’re right, you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know."
"Joey";"All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It’s not likehe’s…Chandler!"
"Chandler";"(from his bedroom) Thanks!"
"Ross";"Look, don’t worry about me. Okay? I’ll just stay real energeticand stay away from the ball. I’ll uh, I’ll be that guy right out of the circle.(He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)"
"All";"Oh!"
"Rachel";"Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him."
"Joey";"Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy(Points). And that one—Dude! They’re all huge!"
"Ross";"They don’t look any bigger than me!"
"Joey";"Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you lookbigger to you from where you are."
"Emily";"I’m just going to say hi to the lads. All right?"
"Ross";"All right."
"Emily";"Okay. (Goes to say hi to the lads.)"
"Phoebe";"(to the player) Hi."
"Phoebe";"Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it."
"Ross";"Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross. (Joey andPhoebe don’t know what he’s talking about.) Y’know, Red Ross!"
"Joey";"I totally don’t know what you’re talking about."
"Ross";"Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for"
"Joey";"No."
"Ross";"You’ll see."
"Emily";"Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it’s hisfirst time."
"Liam";"You don’t say! (We see Ross who is hopping about with the ball andspikes it in his face.)"
"Emily";"(to Ross) Good luck, babe."
"Liam";"Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! (Ross gets pumped up.) Ross! Come on!"
"Liam";"Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!"
"Ross";"JOEY!!!!!!"
"Rachel";"You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today,and guess what happened?"
"Monica";"He asked you out?!"
"Rachel";"No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse."
"Monica";"Saucy!"
"Rachel";"(refers to the table) What are these?"
"Monica";"Electrical plans for the building."
"Rachel";"Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?"
"Monica";"I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city halland got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours."
"Rachel";"Wow! If only more people knew."
"Chandler";"Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport."
"Janice";"Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y’know? Besides, somebody hadto ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’treally seem to care too much that you’re leaving."
"Chandler";"Well, we’re really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess thisis uh, good-bye then."
"Janice";"On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get onthat plane."
"Chandler";"Okay. Then I guess it’s just, wait here then. (Hands her the signthat says, Wait Here.") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen."
"Ticket Counter Attendant";"One ticket to Yemen?"
"Chandler";"Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket."
"Ticket Counter Attendant";"I’m sorry sir, I don’t understand."
"Chandler";"What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?"
"Ticket Counter Attendant";"Are you travelling with a child?"
"Chandler";"No. All right, y’know what, she’s (Points to Janice) gonnathink that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is handyou a library card."
"Ticket Counter Attendant";"Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don’ttake library cards."
"Janice";"What’s the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?"
"Chandler";"(to the ticket agent)"
"Emily";"I can’t believe they’re doing that to him! I told them to goeasy on him!"
"Phoebe";"No offence but, y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you,y’know with the accent, so…"
"Emily";"That’s just halftime, there’s more of this."
"Ross";"Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!"
"Emily";"Right."
"Ross";"(to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottleof water?"
"Emily";"Okay."
"Ross";"Thanks. (When she’s gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think I’mdying. I really do."
"Phoebe";"Oh, poor baby."
"Ross";"(to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.)Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!"
"Emily";"Ross, they are killing you out there!"
"Ross";"(whines "No.") That’s not true!"
"Phoebe";"She’s right! You have to stop!"
"Ross";"What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!"
"Joey";"Dude, if you go back out there, you’re gonna be Dead Ross!"
"Ross";"I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!"
"Emily";"All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me helpyou."
"Ross";"No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything."
"Emily";"No. That’s not what I’m saying. I just may know a few thingsthat might help you inflict some pain."
"Ross";"I like that."
"Emily";"Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle."
"Ross";"Huh?"
"Emily";"One swift kick and he’ll back off."
"Ross";"All right, bad ankle, got it!"
"Emily";"And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh,and David over there, I heard he doesn’t wear a cup."
"Ross";"Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!"
"Emily";"And uh, Liam, Liam’s got bad knees. You hit him right and he’llgo down like a lamp."
"Ross";"But-but, Liam’s on my team."
"Emily";"I don’t care! You just get him!"
"Ross";"I’m gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! (Squeals like amadman.)"
"Joey";"The Red Ross! Okay."
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hi!"
"Rachel";"(noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren’t thereoriginally.) What-what are-what are these?"
"Monica";"Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they’dbrighten up the place. They do don’t you think?"
"Monica";"No-no-no, no!"
"Monica";"I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked thatpicture."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! Look at this!"
"Monica";"Okay, but there"
"Rachel";"I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!"
"Monica";"I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what itdid."
"Rachel";"And did you?!"
"Monica";"No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there,I thought it went downstairs."
"Monica";"But it didn’t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus."
"Rachel";"Oh my God."
"Mrs. Chatracus";"Hello darling."
"Rachel";"Hello, Mrs. Chatracus."
"Phoebe";"Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?"
"Ross";"Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-Iwas great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. Allright? If someone would just grab my wallet, it’s in my pocket."
"Joey";"Yeah, sure."
"Ross";"No, not you. (Emily gets it.)"
"Joey";"Uhh, look, your eye’s still popping out a little, I’m gonna goget some ice."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee andthe ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)"
"Emily";"You were amazing out there."
"Ross";"Oh, I kinda was, wasn’t I?"
"Emily";"Oh my God!"
"Ross";"I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven’t done that since Iwas four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks."
"Emily";"You really enjoyed yourself didn’t you?"
"Ross";"Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloodynose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am. And it’s all because ofyou, wonderful, amazing you."
"Emily";"I think you’ve got concussion."
"Ross";"No, no, I’m serious. Thank you."
"Emily";"You’re welcome. (She hugs him tightly and he winces.) I’msorry. Did I hurt you?"
"Ross";"It’s worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Y’know what,you know what? It’s not."
"Ticket Counter Attendant";"(on the P.A.) This is the final boarding call forFlight 664 to Yemen."
"Chandler";"Well, I-I guess I gotta go."
"Janice";"Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I’ll wait for you. Do you even know how longyou’re going to be gone?"
"Chandler";"Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel."
"Janice";"Oh. Well, I’ll right you everyday. (Reading the address) 15 YemenRoad, Yemen."
"Chandler";"Okay, good-bye. Good-bye."

"Chandler";"No!"
"Janice";"Chandler!"
"Chandler";"Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, andalso-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!"
"Janice";"No! No! I wanna see you take-off."
"Chandler";"Well, I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen!(To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?"
"Monica";"All right. The super couldn’t figure out what it did. A $200 anhour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. I’ve had seven pretty seriousshocks. I officially give up."
"Rachel";"Thank God."
"Monica";"I guess Joey was right, it does nothing."
"Phoebe";"See? I’m doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stopsworking.) I lost it."
"Monica";"What is it hon?"
"Phoebe";"I-I can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makesme nauseous! I’m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! Cake!(Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No."
"Monica";"Aww, honey I’m sorry."
"Phoebe";"God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh!(She goes to the bathroom.)"

"Chandler";"Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!"
"Phoebe";"Being pregnant is tough on your tummy."
"Joey";"Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow."
"Phoebe";"That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glowtoo."
"Joshua";"(coming in from a changing room) Okay!"
"Rachel";"Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted."
"Joshua";"Oh great! (He tries on the coat.) Wow! Yeah, it’s comfortable."
"Rachel";"Yeah?"
"Joshua";"Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing. (He goes to put hishands in his pockets.)"

"Rachel";"Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting. (She goes overand retrieves her note.)"
"Joshua";"(noticing her) Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?"
"Rachel";"Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device."
"Joshua";"Then uh, what’s-what’s this? (Shows her the real anti-theftdevice.)"
"Rachel";"You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief couldjust tear this up. (Rips up the note.)"
"Rachel";"Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, wehave to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans."
"Chandler";"What are you talking about?"
"Joey";"Yeah, what’ going on?"
"Rachel";"We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’sactually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said he’s not ready todate, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now Ihave the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)"
"Ross";"Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and Iaren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to saygood-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, noparty."

"Emily";"I’ll go."
"All";"Yay!"

"Phoebe";"Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’mgonna eat like, y’know millions of cows."

"Phoebe";"What?"
"Joey";"Well, I eat a lot of meat right?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Joey";"Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animalswould die, you-you’d just be eating my animals."
"Phoebe";"Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me."
"Joey";"Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?"
"Ross";"Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and askedfor our check right away."
"Emily";"But, we can’t go now. It looks like Rachel’s gonna put on askit."
"Monica";"Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?"
"Rachel";"No-n-n-n-no! I am"

"Ross";"Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreedthat it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment."
"Rachel";"Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean youdon’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks."
"Ross";"You think?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, andyou’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."
"Ross";"Hey, you’re right."

"Mr. Treeger";"Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it backagain. And I’m sad. (Exits.)"
"Joey";"(to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)"
"Rachel";"All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch thiswhile we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)"

"Chandler";"Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?"
"Joey";"Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!"
"Ross";"What do I do now?"
"Joey";"You play hard to get."
"Ross";"She already lives in London."
"Joey";"Then you go to Tokyo."
"Chandler";"All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her,it’s over."
"Monica";"It is not over! You’re over!"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Monica";"You know!"
"Chandler";"Okay. (Pause) Good one."
"Monica";"It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she lovesyou. And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, itscared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from theplane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)"
"Ross";"Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait.Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and,and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t."
"Joey";"Way to be strong, man!"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a pornbreak. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again."
"Rachel";"Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?"
"Chandler";"Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn."
"Phoebe";"(entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, you’re hear! Okay."
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hi!"
"Rachel";"Well, what-what ‘cha got there?"
"Phoebe";"Oh this, well I’m glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes aknife and an soda can.) Now, don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with anordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what you’rethinking…"
"Chandler";"Pregnant Woman Slays Four?"
"Monica";"Phoebe, they didn’t make you pay for those knives, did they?"
"Phoebe";"No!"
"Monica";"Are you sure?"
"Phoebe";"No!"
"Rachel";"Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alicejust by selling knives."
"Phoebe";"No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the secondpart of my plan."
"Chandler";"What’s the second part of your plan?"
"Phoebe";"My"
"Ross";"(Answers the phone.) Hello?"
"Emily";"Ross."
"Ross";"Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?"
"Emily";"It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said thosewonderful things."
"Ross";"No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad youcalled."
"Emily";"Ross umm, there’s something that I’ve got to tell you,there’s-there’s someone else."
"Ross";"Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?"
"Ross";"She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy."
"Monica";"This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t beanother guy."
"Ross";"Well…"
"Monica";"Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now youhave to prove your love!"
"Ross";"I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If Ihadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I neverwould’ve put my fist through the wall!"
"Chandler";"You put your fist through the wall?"
"Ross";"No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!"
"Ross";"What?"
"Monica";"Yeah, you have to go fight for her!"
"Joey";"Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. ‘Cause you already told heryou love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you thatthere’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her!"
"Monica";"When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?"
"Ross";"I made fun of his accent."
"Monica";"You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am Iright? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?"
"Ross";"No."
"Monica";"All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could beyou and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!"
"Ross";"Really?"
"Monica";"Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her gowithout a fight!"
"Ross";"All right. All right, I’m gonna do it!"
"Monica";"All right."
"Ross";"I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fightfor her."
"Monica";"Okay, good luck!"
"Joey";"Ross! Ross! If you’re going to the airport, could you pick me upanother one of those"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’mgonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work itaround his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!"
"Monica";"That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?"
"Rachel";"Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guysused for catering and we realised…"
"Phoebe";"I’m telling it! I’m telling it!"
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Phoebe";"Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also needmassages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give themassages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you knowwhat I’ve got?"
"Chandler";"A place where no one will ever get out alive?"
"Phoebe";"No! Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need torelax, it’s…"
"Rachel";"(interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!"
"Phoebe";"The name was my favourite part!"
"Rachel";"Well, well I can up with it!"
"Rachel";"Well, I…"
"Monica";"Hello."
"Ross";"(on phone) Hey."
"Monica";"Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?"
"Ross";"No, because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been homeall night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moronwho spent the whole night outside her apartment!"
"Monica";"All right. When is, when is the next flight out?"
"Ross";"About four hours."
"Monica";"Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t showup by then, then just come on home."
"Phoebe";"Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinksthat’s better than Relaxi Cab."
"Rachel";"Okay, it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab, like taxicab."
"Phoebe";"Oh, that is better."
"Chandler";"Are we in London?"
"Monica";"What are you doing here? You can’t be here!"
"Emily";"I’ve uh, I’ve come to talk to Ross."
"Emily";"What?"
"Joey";"(pause) Nothing. No, nothing."
"Emily";"I was going to call him, but…"
"Monica";"Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) Iwas right! (Points to Emily) I’m right, right?"
"Emily";"I’d really rather talk to him."
"Monica";"Oh."
"Emily";"I uh, I’ve been to his apartment and he wasn’t there, and uh. Ineed to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?"
"amazing";"amazing"
"Emily";"Ross, are you there? Ross, I don’t know if you can hear thisbut… (Ross has moved to the window, apparently so that he can hear better.) I’mgonna talk anyway, uh, I’m in the States with you sister and your friends andit’s all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you—Yes,Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell youthat I love you."
"Ross";"(yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine allthe way to New York.) I love you too! I’m, I’m gonna call you right now from thephone booth! (Realises) You can’t hear me. (Goes to make his call.)"
"Emily";"I wish I could know if you’d heard any of that. I suppose I’veeither just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman ifyou’re listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there’snot much chance you did heard that, and there’s the call waiting so, I should go. Ohwell. (Answers the call waiting.) Hello."
"Ross";"Hi."
"Emily";"Ross, I love you!"
"Ross";"Ohh! Thank you."
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Joey";"Hey."
"Chandler";"I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and shedidn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault."
"Joey";"Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over,gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!"
"Chandler";"What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?""
"Joey";"Noo! Nothing!"
"Chandler";"Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn."
"Joey";"I think you’re right."
"Chandler";"All right, ready?"
"Joey";"One."
"Chandler";"Two."
"Both";"Three."
"Joey";"That’s kinda nice."
"Chandler";"Yeah, that’s kinda a relief."
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"You wanna see if we still have it?"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"FREE PORN!!!"
"Joey";"Yeah!!"
"Chandler";"We have free porn here!!!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey! Wow, it"
"Phoebe";"(not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No, it’s justI’m so pregnant that I—my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought‘til I’m not, I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds"
"Chandler";"All right."
"Phoebe";"Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.)"
"Joey";"Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!"
"Phoebe";"I know! I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour!"
"Alice";"(entering) Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!"
"Phoebe";"Hey! What are you doing here?"
"Alice";"Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour."
"Phoebe";"Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in myuterus."
"Alice";"(laughs) No. No. No. (Sits down.) Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girlbaby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR."
"Chandler";"Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?"
"Alice";"Don’t get me started. (To Phoebe) Anyway, umm, since there are threebabies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you namedthe other boy baby."
"Phoebe";"Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar."
"Alice";"You think about it. (Leaves)"
"Emily";"I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don’t think your son willthink it’s yours and be horribly traumatised?"
"Ross";"Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra."
"Emily";"(checks the clock) Ohh, it’s time to go."
"Ross";"Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?"
"Emily";"Well that’s ambitious."
"Ross";"Hey, uh, you can ignore that."
"Emily";"That’s Carol with your son!"
"Ross";"Uhh, believe me when he’s older, he’ll understand."
"Carol";"(knocking on the door) Ross!"
"Ross";"I’ll be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol,Susan, and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh, Emily, this isCarol and Susan."
"Susan";"Hey, it’s so nice to finally meet you!"
"Emily";"Me too!"
"Carol";"Ohh, y’know, Susan’s gonna be shooting a commercial in Londonnext week."
"Susan";"Oh yeah, I’m so excited, I’ve never been there."
"Emily";"Oh, well, I’ll show you around."
"Susan";"That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you canmake any suggestions…"
"Emily";"Oh, there’s tonnes of terrific stuff—I’ll go with you!"
"Susan";"Ahh!"
"Ross";"Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so…"
"Emily";"Are you all right?"
"Susan";"Oh, he’s fine. He’s fine. It’s just that us getting alongis difficult for him, because he doesn’t like me."
"Ross";"Oh come on! That’s-that’s… true."
"Phoebe";"Hi!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?"
"Phoebe";"Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up abook) and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong andconfident, y’know? Like-like Exxon."
"Chandler";"Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid."
"Joey";"Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?"
"Phoebe";"No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a namestarting with "The.""
"Joey";"Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s yourbuddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they’re hanging out withJoey.""
"Chandler";"Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’regonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesn’t think so.) Oh,come on! Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you getto know him."
"Joey";"Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, ifyou need him, he’ll be there."
"Chandler";"Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be alittle late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, ifwant you need him for is that you’re really hot."
"Joey";"What do ya say? What do ya say?"
"Phoebe";"Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joeyand Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, Idon’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk."
"Joey";"I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted toname my kid!"
"Rachel";"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first timetonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She’s holding two frilly,lace nighties.)"
"Monica";"Y’know what? It"
"Rachel";"Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! Igot my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a"
"Monica";"Um-hmm."
"Rachel";"What am I making him by the way?"
"Monica";"Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pinenuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup."
"Rachel";"I thought I was making him filet mignon?"
"Monica";"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some leftover at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it,then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have tomake your famous baked potato and Diet Coke."
"Rachel";"Wow, I really get crabby when I cook."
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Ross";"So uh, Emily called last night…"
"Chandler";"And"
"Ross";"Turns out them Emily is just"
"Phoebe";"God, Susan is so fun!"
"Ross";"Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like sixmonths before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: "My friend Susan is so smart. Myfriend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great.""
"Chandler";"You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?"
"Ross";"Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching!Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’tyou see"
"Joey";"No, but I’m gonna!"
"Chandler";"Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight."
"Ross";"How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I marriedher!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross."
"Ross";"What a weird way to kick me when I’m down."
"Phoebe";"No! No! I-I meant for the baby!"
"Ross";"Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?"
"Phoebe";"Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never tolike The Hulk, y’know…"
"Ross";"Actually that-that’s not true, in"
"Phoebe";"So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey orChandler."
"Joey";"Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person namedChandler."
"Chandler";"Raymond Chandler."
"Joey";"Someone you didn’t make up!"
"Chandler";"Okay, there are"
"Joey";"Yeah, that guy really hurt us."
"Phoebe";"Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s likey’know, Chanoey?"
"Chandler";"Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’llnever be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey."
"Joey";"All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, isthe stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barelyeven a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! All right?It’s a stupid, stupid"
"Chandler";"Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name."
"Joey";"I’m sorry man, I didn’t—I’m-I’m sorry. I’msorry. (Goes over and comforts him.)"
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Joey";"So I guess it’s Joey then!"
"Joshua";"This is so nice. Thank you for doing this."
"Rachel";"Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!"
"Joshua";"Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!"
"Rachel";"(taking a bite) Hmmm!"
"Joshua";"Oh my God!"
"Rachel";"Oh I know, my God, this is so—this rice is so—I am so good."
"Joshua";"Behind you?"
"Rachel";"(sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. They used tolive here; sometimes they migrate back over."
"Joshua";"(getting up and backing away from they.) Is there ah, is there some waythey can not be here. It’s just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, sure, okay. Okay."
"Joey";"(answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He bringsthem inside.)"
"Rachel";"All gone! So, farm birds, huh?"
"Joshua";"Yeah, it’s-it’s my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-Iwould’ve told you about it, but I didn’t know they would be here."
"Rachel";"Oh."
"Joshua";"So, all right."
"Rachel";"Okay. So, can I serve you a little of—What? What? What? (She seesthat Joshua isn’t relaxed.)"
"Joshua";"Nothing I uh, it’s just that I know that they’re still outthere."
"Rachel";"But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, itwould take them a long time to peck their way back over here."
"Joshua";"Okay, that’s-that’s not funny. Uhh."
"Rachel";"Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? Imean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment."
"Joshua";"Oh, they’re working on this week, it’s a total mess. But uh,I’m staying at my parents’ house, we could go there."
"Rachel";"Your parents’?"
"Joshua";"Yeah, they’re out of town."
"Rachel";"Ohh."
"Joshua";"Yeah-yeah, it’s this"
"Rachel";"Yeah that works."
"Joshua";"They-they-they can smell fear."
"Ross";"(opening the door.) Hey!"
"Carol";"Hey! How’s Ben?"
"Ross";"Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I askedhim if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, hesaid, "No." So, he’s sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and adustpan.)"
"Carol";"Hey, Ben! Hey!"
"Ross";"So umm, any word from Susan?"
"Carol";"Ooh, yeah! She said she’s having sooo much fun with Emily."
"Ross";"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, Idon’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?"
"Carol";"What’s too much fun?"
"Ross";"Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married."
"Carol";"Oh my God, you are"
"Ross";"Am I?!"
"Carol";"Yes!"
"Carol";"I can’t speak for Emily, but"
"Ross";"Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment,Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’recoming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks,they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else…There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me thereisn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?"
"Carol";"Maybe."
"Ross";"OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!"
"Joshua";"…and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear toGod, that duck pushed me!"
"Rachel";"Wow! This place is fabulous!"
"Joshua";"Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs livingroom."
"Rachel";"Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, thisplace must’ve been a real babe magnet."
"Joshua";"Yeah, well, it would’ve been, but uh, my parents just moved here."
"Rachel";"Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?"
"Joshua";"Hey, here’s an idea. Why don’t uh, I put the food in thefridge and we can eat it later?"
"Rachel";"That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?"
"Joshua";"Oh yeah, yeah uh, it’s down the hall and uh, second door to yourleft."
"Rachel";"Ah."
"Mrs. Burgin";"Oh, hi, darling!"
"Joshua";"Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?"
"Mrs. Burgin";"Oh, well we cut the trip short."
"Mr. Burgin";"France sucks!"
"Joshua";"Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here."
"Mrs. Burgin";"Oh, say no more!"
"Mr. Burgin";"We’ll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs,and we’ll be right out of you hair."
"Joshua";"Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn’t even get to Italy?"
"Mr. Burgin";"Yep, sucks!"
"Rachel";"Hi you!"
"Joshua";"Oh my God!"
"Rachel";"I know, I can do more than cook."
"Mr. Burgin";"I like her. She sees smart."
"Joshua";"Uhh, Rachel, my parents…"
"Rachel";"Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes theirhands.) Hello."
"Mr. Burgin";"Hi."
"Rachel";"Hello."
"Mrs. Burgin";"Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries."
"Rachel";"What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this isnot—that’s-that’s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, seeand-and, this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s, they’re-they’rewearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how peoplerespond, and then I report back to my superiors at"
"Mrs. Burgin";"Maybe in L.A?"
"Rachel";"Yes!"
"Joshua";"There you go."
"Mr. Burgin";"So, have you kids eaten yet?"
"Rachel";"Well, we were going to do that after—I mean umm, next."
"Mr. Burgin";"Well, we’re starving, why don’t we all go get something toeat?"
"Rachel";"Oh, yeah, well… Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’around the house."
"Mr. Burgin";"So… We go eat."
"Rachel";"Yes."
"Mr. Burgin";"You’ll wear that. We’ll be eating, and of course,you’ll be wearing that."
"Joey";"Dude, I am sorry about what I said!"
"Chandler";"No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!"
"Joey";"It’s not that bad."
"Chandler";"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name."
"Joey";"So, you’re just Bing?"
"Chandler";"I have no name."
"Phoebe";"All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?"
"Chandler";"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint."
"Joey";"No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint."
"Chandler";"Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?"
"Phoebe";"Umm, Gene."
"Chandler";"It’s Clint. It’s Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)"
"Joey";"See you later, Gene."
"Phoebe";"Bye, Gene."
"Chandler";"It’s Clint!"
"Joey";"What’s up with Gene?"
"Monica";"So, you wore your nightie to dinner?"
"Rachel";"Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilledwater down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God!"
"Monica";"Oh, no!"
"Rachel";"No, it’s all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod thereheads in agreement.)"
"Ross";"(returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, sheand Susan are going to a poetry reading together!"
"Rachel";"So?"
"Ross";"So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!"
"Monica";"Emily’s straight."
"Ross";"Oh, wake up!"
"Phoebe";"Wow, Carol really messed you up!"
"Ross";"Excuse me?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous,sycophant. (They all look at her.) All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means,but the rest is right."
"Ross";"Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy,jealous person."
"Rachel";"Huh."
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked outabout Mark and there was nothing going on."
"Monica";"This totally makes sense!"
"Ross";"It does not!"
"Monica";"Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all eventhough"
"Phoebe";"All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!"
"Rachel";"Absolutely! Absolutely!"
"Monica";"This is so much fun!"
"Ross";"This is"
"Monica";"Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened withCarol ruin what you got with Emily."
"Phoebe";"Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t."
"Ross";"Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing."
"Rachel";"What—yeah—what, y’know what? I hope Emily"
"Phoebe";"Drum roll."
"Chandler";"(entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?"
"Joey";"Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a goodBarney."
"Chandler";"All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going downto the courthouse."
"Phoebe";"You’re actually going through with this?"
"Chandler";"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay,it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well withwomen… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson orJohn Markson."
"Phoebe";"You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has gotto stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes, (To Joey) I’m, I’m sorry. Iknow you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’mgonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler."
"Chandler";"(pleased) Really?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!"
"Chandler";"Okay. Thanks."
"Phoebe";"Okay!"
"Chandler";"You wanna hug it out?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah!"
"Phoebe";"Yay!"
"Chandler";"Yay!"
"Phoebe";"Yay—oh—yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!"
"Chandler";"Okay!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh, uh… (She grabs her coat and runs out.)"

"Joey";"Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know, kindalike a peace offering."
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, that’s very nice. Plus, y’know they were free andthey’re too small."

"Chandler";"Plus, you look cool."
"Rachel";"(entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua…"
"Phoebe";"Oh, how did it go?"
"Rachel";"Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girlwho is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time."
"Phoebe";"What did he say?"
"Rachel";"Well uh, his answering machine was"
"Monica";"Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything thathe’s gonna call you again."
"Rachel";"Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t thinkhe’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totallyokay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handlingit all that well."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, maybe."
"Rachel";"And I-I am just trying to figure out why."
"Phoebe";"Any luck?"
"Rachel";"Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, onagain, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be onagain."
"Monica";"Again. Y’know what? I think we all did."
"Ross";"(entering) Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emily’s wedding dress intoRachel’s room.)"
"Ross";"So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about,Ernie’s at 9 o’clock?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three."
"Ross";"Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three."
"Rachel";"Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there."
"Ross";"What happened?"
"Rachel";"Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me."
"Ross";"Noo. Why?"
"Rachel";"Well, apparently he scares easy."
"Ross";"Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry."
"Rachel";"It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’dthought they would."
"Ross";"Come here."
"Rachel";"(breaking the hug) Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Ross";"You okay?"
"Rachel";"Yeah! I got my girls."
"Rachel";"Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe’s lap.)"
"Phoebe";"(looks at Monica) Hey, y’know what might cheer you up?"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Rachel";"Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood."
"Monica";"Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause)Maybe someday, there will be."

"Rachel";"Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)"
"Monica";"No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!"

"Rachel";"I’m not gonna marry Chandler!"
"Phoebe";"Not after this!"
"Rachel";"Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as shedoes, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it’s Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on thedoor.)"
"Joshua";"I gotta go."
"Rachel";"Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, thatoughta do it."
"Joey";"(muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am"
"Chandler";"Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much hashappened."
"Joey";"I know."
"Chandler";"Phoebe is, making people."
"Joey";"Everybody’s doing stuff!"
"Chandler";"And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would evenknow I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something.Okay? Something huge!"
"Joey";"(snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!"
"Chandler";"No-no, not something stupid, something huge."
"Joey";"No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thingeveryday! We could totally do that!"
"Chandler";"Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’sjust, it’s just steep!"

"Joey";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"What-what’s up?"
"Joey";"We’re gonna climb Mt. Everest!"
"Chandler";"Yeah baby!"
"Phoebe";"Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 andy’know you can die. And, you would die!"
"Chandler";"(dejected) Yeah, well…"
"Joey";"We could get that Everest video though."
"Chandler";"Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!"
"Joey";"And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we couldrent?"
"Chandler";"(dejected) Oh, well…"
"Phoebe";"So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?"

"Joey";"Yeah we are!"
"Emily";"So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?"
"Ross";"Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly toLondon in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands hersome envelopes.)"
"Emily";"Yeah, they’re fine."
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Emily";"If anyone asks, we’ll just say Ben addressed them. (Looking throughthe envelopes.) Oh! So you invited Rachel then?"
"Ross";"Sure. Why not?"
"Emily";"Really?"
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Emily";"I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old loversthere."
"Ross";"Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her?"
"Emily";"Oh, no-no, y’know I absolutely adore Rachel it’s just that,well it might be a awkward for you. But it’s absolutely your decision. (Gets up.)More tea?"
"Ross";"Yeah sure."

"Rachel";"I knew."
"Ross";"You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geekyolder brother."
"Rachel";"I did."
"Ross";"Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerabilitybecome any kind of a factor here—but do you think it would be okay if I asked youout? Sometime? Maybe?"

"Rachel";"(hurt) What?"
"Ross";"I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you."

"Monica";"You don’t have a car. And your license expired."
"Rachel";"I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I haveso little time to do it in."
"Chandler";"All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here thatthere’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from thebook.) "It’s almost as good as being there.""
"Joey";"It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!"
"Phoebe";"(angrily) That’s like the tenth time I’ve peed since I’vebeen here!"
"Monica";"That’s also like the tenth time you told us."

"Ross";"Pheebs, did…you want a cookie?"
"Phoebe";"(starting to cry) Thank you so much."
"Rachel";"So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?"

"Chandler";"(shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!"
"Ross";"So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?"
"Joey";"Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planningbachelor parties, don’t you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?"
"Chandler";"Oh, it’s awkward. It’s awkward. It’s awkward."
"Ross";"I sort’ve already asked Chandler."
"Joey";"What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!"
"Ross";"Joey, I figured you’d understand. I mean, I-I’ve known him a lotlonger."
"Joey";"Come on Ross! Look, I-I don’t have any brothers; I’ll never getto be a best man!"
"Chandler";"You can be the best man when I get married."
"Joey";"(pause) I’ll never get to be a best man!"
"Ross";"(to Chandler) Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I neverget to be yours at all?"

"Chandler";"You slept with the stripper?"
"Joey";"Of course!! (Shrugs.)"
"Phoebe";"Hi, guys."
"Rachel";"Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe’s way.)"
"Monica";"Hi Phoebe."
"Phoebe";"I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgyyesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know."
"Rachel";"No we…"
"Monica";"Hormones."
"Rachel";"…hormones, yeah."
"Phoebe";"Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.(She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)"
"Monica";"Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-howare things going?"
"Phoebe";"Good. Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels likeeverything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?"
"Rachel";"Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going toRoss’s wedding."
"Phoebe";"Oh!"
"Rachel";"It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…"
"Phoebe";"Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the streetand this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him."
"Rachel";"Well, h-how is this like that?"
"Phoebe";"Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see"
"Rachel";"(starting to cry) I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that…"
"Phoebe";"Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)"
"Joey";"Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the companythat sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if thisisn’t an emergency, then what is?"
"Ross";"(entering) Hey guys!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey…"
"Ross";"I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! Andthe guys from work had a blast. Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelorparty before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so…"
"Joey";"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!"
"Ross";"Yeah, right!"
"Joey";"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up formyself, I might want to get one of those…"
"Ross";"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring andthe clothes on her back were all she had with her."
"Chandler";"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a littlesqueeze.)"
"Ross";"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bridewho has worn it has had a long and happy life."
"Chandler";"So you might say, it’s a magic ring."
"Joey";"(laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it."
"Ross";"My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!H-how?! How could this all happen?!"
"Chandler";"Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, whydon’t you be my best man.""
"Ross";"(dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I’m gonna call thecops!"
"Joey";"Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!"
"Ross";"Not on you! On the stripper!"
"Joey";"Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look intoit right after they solved all the murders."
"Ross";"Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!"
"Joey";"I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number.They said, "If I bothered them again they’d call the police." I said,"If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!""
"Ross";"So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’snothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!"
"Joey";"Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…"
"Chandler";"Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had hercome to my office?"
"Joey";"Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!"
"Monica";"Here’s your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take astep back.)"
"Phoebe";"(sips it) It’s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh ofrelief.) Oh, thanks."
"Rachel";"Good."
"Monica";"I’m so glad you liked it."
"Phoebe";"(sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)"
"Monica";"What?!"
"Rachel";"What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction."
"Rachel";"You what?"
"Monica";"Oh my God!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know thatwas"
"Monica";"Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’tsterilised it since the guys moved out!"
"Rachel";"Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what?It’s okay. I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna boil some water and justrip up some sheets!"
"Phoebe";"No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They saidthat, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book."
"Monica";"Rachel, get the book! The book!"
"Rachel";"Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!"
"Monica";"The Bible?!"
"Rachel";"I don’t know!"
"Joey";"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why wouldshe? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I’llbe uh, Mr. Wong."
"Ross";"Diverse."
"The Stripper";"Did anybody call for security?"
"Chandler";"(to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they allturn there backs on her.)"
"The Stripper";"Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? (Sees Joey.)Hey, Joey?"
"Ross";"Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where isit? Where is it?"
"Chandler";"Way to be cool, man."
"The Stripper";"What’s he talking about?"
"Joey";"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!"
"The Stripper";"Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?"
"The Guys";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!"
"The Stripper";"Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don’t need tosteal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guysmake that?"
"Chandler";"Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)"
"Joey";"I don’t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn’ttake it, and I didn’t take it; and you (Chandler) didn’t take it, then who did?(The duck quacks.) Shh! We’re trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at thesame moment and stare at Joey, who doesn’t get it. After a short pause, with the duckstill quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)"
"Rachel";"I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour."
"Phoebe";"Well, do you"
"Monica";"How do you feel?"
"Phoebe";"Okay, I guess. I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess Iknow it’s going to be over soon."
"Rachel";"Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this."
"Phoebe";"I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re, whenyou’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing.I’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila."
"Monica";"Some moms do that."
"Phoebe";"Okay that’s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myselfinto, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like Iknow them y’know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not gonna be easy when these littlebabies have to go away."
"Monica";"Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not gonna haveanything. You’re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that’s evenbetter."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, okay."
"Rachel";"No, really. Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worryingabout saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, ordeciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?"
"Monica";"I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wannarun away from home, and the one they talk to about sex."
"Rachel";"And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!"
"Phoebe";"Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"And y’know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you."
"Phoebe";"They are gonna love me."
"Rachel";"Oh!"

"Monica";"Oh my God!"
"Phoebe";"Got cha again, you guys are so easy."

"Ross";"Joey! The vet said it’s a simple procedure."
"Joey";"So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t makeit?!"
"Chandler";"He will, Joe."
"Joey";"Yeah, but what if he doesn’t? He’s such a good duck."
"Joey";"I’m so worried about him, y’know?"
"The Doctor";"(coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?"
"Ross";"Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it,and then does a double-take realising where it’s been.)"
"Joey";"H-h-h-how’s the duck?"
"The Doctor";"He’s doing just fine, he’s resting now, but you can seehim in a little bit."
"Joey";"Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this."
"Ross";"No, that’s all right."
"Joey";"No, it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally letyou down!"
"Chandler";"Hey, come on, it’s not your fault."
"Joey";"Yeah, it is! You wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? Y’knowwhat, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man."
"Chandler";"No, you should."
"Joey";"Now, don’t argue with me…"
"Ross";"Hey! Hey! Hey!"
"Chandler";"Really?"
"Joey";"Really?"
"Ross";"Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-aremy… I mean, I’m lucky to have just one good… (They all start gettingemotional.)"
"Chandler";"Thanks man."

"Chandler";"What a baby."
"Ross";"Total wuss!"
"Monica";"Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time toget a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London,there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)"
"Chandler";"Six-hour trip to London. That’s a lot of Monica."
"Monica";"Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera,check! Traveller’s cheques, check!"
"Rachel";"Who are you saying "check" too?"
"Monica";"Myself. Y’know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a goodthing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she onlydid it the one time. But it was pretty weird."

"Ross";"Hey! Are you ready yet?"
"Monica";"Yep! You got the tickets?"
"Ross";"Oh! Got ‘em right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!"
"Joey";"It’s all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less thanenthused Chandler and starts towards the girls’ apartment.)"
"Chandler";"You got your passport?"
"Joey";"Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don’t want to lose that."
"Joey";"Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)"
"Chandler";"There it is."
"Monica";"Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-handside. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator…"

"Joey";"Come on! Do something!"
"Chandler";"I am, I’m ignoring you."
"Joey";"Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. Allright, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his "pop-up" map ofLondon. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)"
"Chandler";"Oh, what the hell is that?"
"Joey";"It’s London, baby! All right, the hotel’s here. (Points to themap.) Wait. No, we wanna go… No. I know. (Sets the map down.) I’m gonna have togo into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)"
"Chandler";"Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!"
"Joey";"I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go."
"Chandler";"Okay. Listen-listen, we’re not gonna have to walk this way theentire time are we?"
"Joey";"Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)"
"Emily";"…and that was all before 10 o’clock. The caterer rang and saidit was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phonedto say there aren’t any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.We’re not gonna be…"

"Ross";"What?! No! No! That’s-that’s time-out!"
"Emily";"Sorry."
"Ross";"Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything’s gonna be great, okay? Come on.Come on."
"Monica";"Chicken Kiev?"
"Ross";"Um-hmm! Doesn’t that sound delicious at the last minute?"
"Monica";"Yeah, y’know, but something like salmon which would be so much moreelegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn’t have to worry about the salmonella. (Rosspushes her.) So, I can’t wait to see this place you’re getting married!"
"Ross";"Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily’s parents got marriedhere."
"Emily";"I still can’t believe they’re tearing it down. It really is themost lovely building you’ll ever see. I mean it’s over… (She stopssuddenly, when she sees that demolition has already started.) Oh my God!"
"Monica";"It’s nice."
"Emily";"Oh. Oh. (She starts running towards the building.)"
"Emily";"(running in, with Ross) Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? Whatare we going to do?"
"Ross";"It’s all right! Everything’s gonna be all right."
"Emily";"How’s it gonna be all right?!"
"Ross";"Uh-huh, I see that."
"Monica";"(entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found outwhat happened."
"Ross";"What? What?"
"Monica";"They torn it down a few days early."
"Joey";"All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I’ve ever seen.Hey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey,Chandler?"
"Chandler";"I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’rethinking of changing the name of this place."
"Joey";"Really? To what?"
"Chandler";"To Put the Camera Away!!!"
"Joey";"Man,"
"Phoebe";"Oh. Oh."
"Rachel";"Oh, honey! Don’t get up! What do you need?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, no. Oh, nothing."
"Rachel";"Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything."
"Phoebe";"Okay, I have a wedgie."

"Phoebe";"So-so, what do you want for lunch?"
"Rachel";"Oh, I don’t know. I guess we"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?"
"Rachel";"I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. Ishouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me."
"Phoebe";"Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in lovewith was getting married…"
"Rachel";"(interrupting) Still in love with?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah!"
"Rachel";"I’m not in love with Ross!"
"Phoebe";"Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither."

"Phoebe";"Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything."
"Rachel";"Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me!"
"Phoebe";"Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, thatwould be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean.""
"Joey";"Hey!"
"The Vendor";"So, what are you guys in the market for? We’ve got uh, scarves,tulip post cards..."
"Joey";"Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag onthe front of it.) Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?"
"Chandler";"Well, I don’t have to buy that, "I’m with stupid"T-shirt anymore."
"Joey";"Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)"
"Chandler";"All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you?Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?"
"Joey";"Oh, I embarrass you?"
"Chandler";"How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?"
"The Vendor";"He’s just jealous. You’ll fit right in; all Londoners wearthem!"
"Chandler";"Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?"
"The Vendor";"(looks around) They’re all tourists."
"Chandler";"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public,y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
"Joey";"Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If you’re gonna make me choose betweenyou and the hat? I choose the hat."
"The Vendor";"Good choice."
"Joey";"Thanks."
"Chandler";"Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. Iam not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower standand walks away trying to be cool.)"
"Emily";"Hello?"
"Ross";"Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to thinkwe’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding."
"Emily";"We don’t have to."
"Ross";"Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?"
"Emily";"No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hallbeing knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit."
"Ross";"She said what?"
"Emily";"She said, "If I’m not gonna be happy getting married somewherethat we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.""
"Ross";"Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parentsspent on this wedding? Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends thatpeople took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He putshis pants on backwards.) This isn’t right."
"Emily";"I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m surethey’ll come back when we can do it right."
"Ross";"I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?(Holds out his pants)"
"Emily";"Don’t you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) Wehave no choice! Anywhere that’s half-decent would’ve be booked months ago, Rossdon’t you understand? This is our wedding I’m talking about."
"Ross";"The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This iswhen we’re getting married."
"Emily";"So what are you saying? It’s now or never?"
"Ross";"No. I’m saying it’s now. (He starts putting on his pants,backwards again.)"
"Emily";"Or?"
"Ross";"There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!"
"Emily";"It’s not the pants. It’s you that is backwards. And if, and ifyou don’t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps weshouldn’t get married at all! (She storms out.)"
"Ross";"(chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No,wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—(He catches something important in thezipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"(depressed) Hi."

"Rachel";"Manhattan does not have enough stores."
"Phoebe";"Well,"
"Rachel";"You can?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross."
"Rachel";"Um-hmm."
"Phoebe";"And a small piece of chocolate."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Phoebe";"And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)"
"Rachel";"Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with somegraveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?"
"Phoebe";"Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you,the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay,I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all ofthe bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws."
"Rachel";"I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out."
"Phoebe";"Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that Ilove Ross, I think he’s such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabsit out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Rossokay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running yourhands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh grossit’s some kind of grease, it’s—uck! Hah?"
"Rachel";"I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much,and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy."
"Phoebe";"Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let’s trysome uh, aversion therapy."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Phoebe";"Okay?"
"Rachel";"All right."
"Phoebe";"So uh, now look at the picture…"

"Joey";"Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!"
"Chandler";"No-no-no, y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that youwere embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel anybetter, I’ve had a really lousy day."
"Joey";"Me too."
"Chandler";"Yeah?"
"Joey";"Noo!! I’ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!"
"Monica";"(entering) Hey!"

"Ross";"Hey-hey, since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady, here’s apickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding atall?"
"Monica";"She said that?!"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Monica";"Why?!"
"Ross";"I don’t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding justbecause the hall was gone and she liked flipped out."
"Monica";"Oh my God. You’re even dumber than"
"Ross";"Excuse me?"
"Monica";"Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?"
"Ross";"I don’t know. A month?"
"Monica";"Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since thefirst time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That’s what wedid! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfectfour-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross getsthrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the mostimportant part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all thatother stuff was."
"Ross";"I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys werejust doing the flying nun."
"Monica";"Sometimes we were."
"Ross";"Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?"
"Monica";"Okay."
"Ross";"Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)"
"Chandler";"That was pretty intense huh?"
"Joey";"Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didn’t think that we just went inthere because we were uncomfortable being out here!"
"Chandler";"(glares at him) I hope he did!"
"Phoebe";"Hello."
"Joey";"(on phone) Hey, Pheebs! It’s Joey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks justlike you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then Ifigured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you."
"Joey";"That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how thechick and the duck are doing?"
"Phoebe";"Ohh, they’re having a"
"Joey";"Kinda, but I’ve just been having way too much fun."
"Phoebe";"So you’re not homesick yet?"

"Joey";"Who’s seven?"
"Phoebe";"Y’know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies…"
"Joey";"Ahh, the babies miss me?"

"Monica";"You’ll see."
"Emily";"I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen."
"Emily";"Oh God."
"Ross";"Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y’know fewerbricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles…"
"Monica";"And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a littlealcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and… (Points to Ross) Yougo."
"Ross";"But-but, if you don’t love this, we’ll do it in any other placeat any other time. Really, it’s fine, whatever you want."
"Emily";"It’s perfect."
"Ross";"And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain…"

"Rachel";"Do you remember where the duck food is?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink. Why?"

"Phoebe";"What?! What do you mean you’re going to London?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, youdon’t have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.)"
"Phoebe";"I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel!He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision."
"Phoebe";"That’s not why you’re going! You’re going because youhope he’s gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that Britishchippy.""
"Rachel";"Ohh—Do you think he will?!"
"Phoebe";"No! Because he’s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, ifyou go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y’know,it’s too late! You missed you’re chance! I’m sorry, I know this must bereally hard, it’s over."

"Housekeeper";"The Waltham Residence."
"Phoebe";"Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily’s Parents’ house."
"Housekeeper";"This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that isnot how one addresses oneself on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asksfor the person with whom one wishes to speak."
"Phoebe";"(In a British accent) This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-ifit’s not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?"
"Housekeeper";"Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it’s not politeto make fun of people. Goodbye."
"Phoebe";"No no no, I’ll be nice, I swear!!!   Could you just give me thenumber for where they are?"
"Housekeeper";"I’m afraid, I’m not at liberty to divulge that information."
"Phoebe";"Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warnsomebody, alright. So if you don’t give me that number then I’m going to comeover there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire."

"Mr. Geller";"Ohh, I thought that you...."
"Ross and Monica";"Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!"
"Emily";"Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Stevenand Andrea Waltham."
"Mr. Waltham";"(Shaking everyone's hand.) Hello. Hello. How do you do? How do you do?Very nice to meet you. (Looking over at his wife.) Darling it’s the Gellers.

"Chandler";"Joey, it’s been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick,Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself."
"Joey";"(Pointing  at Chandler.) Your different here too. Your mean in England.(Chandler throws his hands up to his head in frustration. They walk away from each other.)"
"Mr. Geller";"(Looking at ht wedding bill.) What the hell!!!"
"Ross";"what’s up, Dad?"
"Mr. Geller";"This bill for my half of the wedding. it’s insane."
"Mrs. Geller";"How could it be so much? The receptions at their house."
"Mr. Geller";"(Pointing items out on the bill.) Flowers, liquor, recarpet firstfloor. New guest bath, landscaping. I’m paying to remodel this guys house. (Angrilygets up.) I’m going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind."

"Rachel";"Ohh, okay, how about five. (She hands her all the credit cards.) Ohh, thankyou."
"Ticket Agent";"I’m just going to need to see your passport."
"Rachel";"(Looking through her purse.) Okay, you know what? I don’t have it, butI can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? Ihave my drivers license and I have a twenty. (She slides it across the counter.)"
"Ticket Agent";"(Slides the twenty back and tosses her credit card onto the counter.)"
"Ross";"Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue andbelieve me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn."
"Mr. Waltham";"Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments."
"Ross";"I go back there with lawn ornaments, he’s going to laugh in my face."
"Mrs. Waltham";"This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement. (Ross looksfrustrated. She begins to scream at her husband.) Will you say something, Steven?!Please!!!"

"Chandler";"I’d like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will betomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will.(No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I known Ross for a longtime. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looksembarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he overinflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh, DearGod.. (A cellular phone rings.)"

Okay, Icouldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming upto me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it wassooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why,because I make very bad decisions."
"Chandler";"Oh that's not true."
"Rachel";"Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London."
"Phoebe";"London is stupid! Stupid!"
"Rachel";"Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from nowon you make all of my decisions for me."
"Phoebe";"Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable havingthat kind of power and control over someone's life."
"Monica";"I'll do it!"
"Rachel";"That's fine. So Monica,"
"Chandler";"Okay, I gotta go to work."
"Chandler";"And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back."
"Chandler";"Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Alwaysa pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)"
"Monica";"Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and youat the reception."
"Rachel";"Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't—I still can't believeit. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)"
"Monica";"Honey, sweetie, by the edges."
"Rachel";"I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest ofthe pictures)…"
"Monica";"Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.)"
"Rachel";"…I mean it's my fault."
"Monica";"Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!"
"Rachel";"Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.)"
"Monica";"Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, Iknow that wasn't about me."
"Joey";"(To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little."
"Monica";"If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would noticethat there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns tolisten in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute."
"Rachel";"Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda…"
"Monica";"(Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points atanother guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember?"
"Rachel";"Oh, I don't know. I don't know."
"Monica";"You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make yourdecisions and I say you're going to talk to him."
"Rachel";"All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me."
"Joey";"Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey, Pheebs!"
"Monica";"We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of usat the Tower of London."
"Phoebe";"(Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we"
"Chandler";"All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too muchhaven't we?"
"Phoebe";"No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I everget to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out."
"All";"Sorry."
"Monica";"What happened?"
"Rachel";"Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a datetomorrow night."
"Monica";"See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!"
"Rachel";"Well…"
"Gunther";"(To the guy) Get out!"
"Monica";"What took you so long?"
"Chandler";"I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow."
"Monica";"Oh, good."
"Chandler";"So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kissesher.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs herand kisses her.)"
"Joey";"(Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!"
"Monica";"Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London."
"Rachel";"That's not European!"
"Phoebe";"Well, it felt French."
"Rachel";"Oh God, I really had a good time!"
"Dave";"Yeah, me too. (They reach her door.) So, I guess this is it."
"Rachel";"Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?"
"Dave";"Yeah!"
"Rachel";"Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this.Umm, okay, just hold on a second."
"Dave";"Okay, yeah!"
"Rachel";"Umm, hi!"
"Ross";"Hi."
"Rachel";"Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something."
"Ross";"She's doing her laundry."
"Rachel";"What's that? (Points to the box.)"
"Ross";"It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one foreach day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!"
"Rachel";"Oh, honey that's awful."
"Ross";"Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna gowander out in the rain for a while."
"Rachel";"But, it's not raining."
"Ross";"I can't catch a break!"
"Rachel";"Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit righthere. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. Allright? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!"
"Dave";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is justreally sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I knowthings seem so bad right now."
"Monica";"(Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I droppedsome socks."
"Rachel";"Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for thedropped socks.)"
"Monica";"What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do youwant to fall"
"Rachel";"Ohh!"
"Monica";"I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, youlisten to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! Whatthe hell were you trying to do?"
"Rachel";"Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know,that I'm still in love with him."
"Monica";"(Gasps) What?!! You"
"Rachel";"Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!"
"Monica";"I make the decisions, and I say no."
"Rachel";"Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what,you're fired."
"Monica";"You can't fire me."
"Rachel";"Well… (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry andthrows it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close thedoor. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)"
"Monica";"Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!"
"Joey";"(Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?"
"Monica";"Rachel locked the door."
"Joey";"I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar."
"Monica";"Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!"
"Monica";"Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?"
"Rachel";"No."
"Monica";"I really need to talk to you."
"Rachel";"Well, then talk!"
"Monica";"Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wantedto do?"
"Rachel";"Yes!"
"Ross";"What thing?"
"Monica";"Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is areally stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knowswho she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting."
"Ross";"Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. Igotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) MyGod, think of the massacre."
"Rachel";"I'm gonna do it."
"Monica";"All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before youtell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea.Because I bet you, you can't."
"Rachel";"But I…"
"Monica";"Please!"
"Rachel";"All right, fine."
"Monica";"Joey, I'm in!"
"Joey";"(In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal."
"All";"Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!"
"Joey";"Uh, okay, Pheebs?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah?"
"Joey";"Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get togo to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah?"
"Joey";"All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should alltake a little trip together!"
"Phoebe";"Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!"
"Monica";"Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in CentralPark!"
"Phoebe";"(excited)"
"Joey";"Yeah, all of us! All day!"
"Phoebe";"That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are wegonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, allright!""
"Chandler";"Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Parkidea. (Gets up to leave.)"
"Rachel";"(stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr.Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new Europeanthing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortableand I just—y'know—stop it!"
"Chandler";"I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group."
"Phoebe";"That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth."
"Monica";"Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.)"
"Ross";"Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!"
"Joey";"Phoebe!"

"Rachel";"Phoebe, woo!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, woo! Hi."
"Chandler";"Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know, itdidn't have any… It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that wewould all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?"
"Joey";"Mine!"
"Ross";"Wait! It was"

"Rachel";"Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute."
"Monica";"No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him."
"Rachel";"Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter."
"Monica";"Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someonethat you love them and not have them say it back?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I-I don't care."
"Monica";"Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)"
"Rachel";"What 'cha readin'?"
"Ross";"The paper."

"Rachel";"(Laughing) I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious."
"Ross";"Why are you laughing?"
"Rachel";"Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it'sridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, andit's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know?And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like,"You are such an idiot!""
"Ross";"Well, well I"
"Rachel";"(laughs) I'm sorry, that's not funny."
"Ross";"Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know wheremy wife is. (Laughs) "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!"
"Rachel";"Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that youjust forget that I told you this?"
"Ross";"Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is…"
"Rachel";"The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily."
"Ross";"That is what the thing is."
"Rachel";"Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was thatjust the stupidest thing, me telling you that?"
"Ross";"No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's alwaysgreat when someone tells you they love you."

"Chandler";"All right."
"Frank";"It's not"

"Ross";"Again, it's not that he…"
"Chandler";"(spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!"

"Ross";"Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie orany of the"
"Phoebe";"Hi! And you're going into what grade?"
"Dr. Oberman";"Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, yousee, I-I graduated early…"
"Phoebe";"(interrupting) Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified thatI'd be needing a grown up doctor."
"Dr. Oberman";"Oh no, I'm fully qualified to…"
"Phoebe";"Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be havingbabies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!"

"Phoebe";"Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!"
"Rachel";"Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep"
"Phoebe";"Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they'rey'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss anopportunity just because I didn't"
"Rachel";"Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane."

"Ross";"(entering) Hey! I just heard. What's up?"
"Joey's Doctor";"Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break upthe stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means wecan either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra…"

"Monica";"Great!"
"Chandler";"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
"Monica";"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goofaround with him."
"Chandler";"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing aroundin the dictionary… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends whocare a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to,y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am"
"Monica";"I think you're better than you think you are."

"Monica";"Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (Theykiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don'tdo the dance."

"Phoebe";"Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a secondalone with the babies."
"All";"Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah."
"Phoebe";"So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in thatlittle petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but theywere wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home andsee you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sisterhas a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Littlehigh fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.)Well, if you're gonna cry. (She starts crying.)"
"Monica";"Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!"
"Phoebe";"I know."
"Rachel";"So does it really hurt as bad as they say?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah. You won't be able to take it."
"Chandler";"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are theygonna name her?"
"Phoebe";"They're gonna call her Chandler."
"Chandler";"That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?"
"Phoebe";"Works on you."
"Monica";"(In a sexy voice) Come in. I've been waiting for you."
"Rachel";"Hi! I just wanna-(sees Monica)-Ahhh!!! Oh my God! (She runs out inhorror.) Oh my God!"
"Monica";"(pulling on a robe) Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I wastaking a nap."
"Rachel";"Since when do take naps in"
"Monica";"Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. (Thinks) I'm seeing a guy from work!Ha!"
"Rachel";"(Gasps) That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that lookslike a non-threatening Ray Liotta?"
"Monica";"Uh-huh, that one!"
"Rachel";"Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'mjust gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. (There's a knock onthe door.) Maybe that's him. (Goes to answer the door.)"
"Monica";"(Panicking) Okay, umm, okay, umm… (Rachel opens the door.) It'sjust Joey and Ross."
"Rachel";"Why aren't you guys at the movie?"
"Joey";"Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw usout!"
"Ross";"I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!"
"Joey";"(to Monica and Rachel) He's talking to London!"
"Monica";"But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?"
"Joey";"Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hopingthat someone will help him get in touch with her."
"Ross";"(on phone) I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy,old twit!"
"Joey";"Ross! Way to suck up to the family."
"Chandler";"(entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that Monicais the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are allhere! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!"
"Joey";"(entering, wearing a tux) Hey!"
"Chandler";"Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!"
"Joey";"Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned."
"Monica";"Vomit tux? Who vomited on—y'know what, what you up to Joe?"
"Joey";"Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job asco-host!"
"Monica";"Oh that's great!"
"Joey";"A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's thekind of math Joey likes to do!"
"Phoebe";"Ugh, PBS!"
"Monica";"What's wrong with PBS?"
"Phoebe";"Ugh, what's"
"Joey";"Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?"
"Phoebe";"Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in thisreally bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if Iwrote to"
"Chandler";"Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs."
"Phoebe";"All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box.I didn't have keys!"
"Joey";"I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed.Like-like you did with the babies."
"Phoebe";"This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totallyselfish."
"Joey";"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother?Talk about selfish!"
"Phoebe";"What-what are you talking about?!"
"Joey";"Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feelreally good right?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah. So?"
"Joey";"It made"
"Phoebe";"Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless."
"Joey";"Well, may I ask for one example?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not!"
"Joey";"That's because all people are selfish."
"Phoebe";"Are you calling me selfish?!"
"Joey";"Are you calling you people? (Chandler rolls his eyes.) Yeah, well sorry toburst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal onSanta Clause right?"
"Phoebe";"I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evilgenius."
"Ross";"(on phone) Hello."
"Emily";"(on phone from London) Hello, Ross?"
"Ross";"Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! (He picks up a lamp andhands it to Chandler, for no reason.) It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! (to Emily)Hi!"
"Emily";"Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!"
"Ross";"No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling!I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talkto me!"
"Emily";"Really? About what?"
"Ross";"Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I reallymiss you."
"Emily";"I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do."
"Ross";"(to the gang, whispering) She's talking."
"All";"(subdued) Yay! (He motions for them to keep quiet, including Chandler whois still holding the lamp Ross handed him, before he goes off to talk to Emily inprivate.)"
"Phoebe";"Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?"
"Joey";"That he doesn't exist."
"Phoebe";"Right. (She turns and opens her eyes in shock.)"
"Rachel";"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?"
"Chandler";"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him."
"Rachel";"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?"
"Monica";"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyoneyet."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet."
"Rachel";"I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she everhad!"
"Chandler";"Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?"
"Monica";"I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?"
"Chandler";"Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And"
"Ross";"(entering) Hi!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship."
"Chandler";"Yes!"
"Monica";"That's great!"
"Ross";"In London!"
"Monica";"What?!"
"Ross";"She wants me to move to London."
"Monica";"But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that."
"Rachel";"What-what-what are you gonna do?"
"Ross";"I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to Londonwith Ben."
"Monica";"Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to anothercountry so you can patch things up with your new wife."
"Ross";"It could happen."
"Joey";"(To the pledge volunteers) How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!"
"Stage Director";"This will be your phone."
"Joey";"That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls."
"Stage Director";"No you answer it and take pledges."
"Joey";"But I'm the host!"
"Stage Director";"No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones."
"Joey";"You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray."
"Stage Director";"Well, here's your phone doctor. (She walks away.)"
"Phoebe";"I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guythat lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on hisfront stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful.That old jackass!"
"Rachel";"Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish."
"Phoebe";"I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to threechildren and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!"
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?"
"Monica";"Sure!"
"Chandler";"If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secretboyfriend is better in bed than Richard?"
"Rachel";"Chandler! (Pause) Is he?"
"Monica";"Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secretboyfriend."
"Chandler";"Why?! I mean if this guy was"
"Ross";"All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to Londonwithout Ben."
"Emily";"I understand that would be difficult."
"Ross";"Yeah, would you"
"Emily";"I don't know, it's just…"
"Ross";"Oh-oh-okay, but-but"
"Emily";"All right."
"Ross";"All right, did you just say all right?"
"Emily";"I did. Now I'm the idiot."
"Ross";"Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonnabe like-like-like two idiots in love!"
"Emily";"Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still."
"Ross";"Yes, tell me."
"Emily";"Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on thataltar in front of my entire family, all my friends."
"Ross";"I know. I am, I am so sorry."
"Emily";"And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catchingour plane with her."
"Ross";"Again, very sorry."
"Emily";"I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad justthinking of you being in the same room as her!"
"Ross";"Emily, there is"
"Emily";"All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work."
"Ross";"Oh that is so great! That's…"
"Emily";"(interrupting him) As long as you don't see Rachel anymore."
"Ross";"So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes."
"Chandler";"Yes!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh-ohh!"
"Monica";"Great!"
"Ross";"No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again."
"Phoebe";"Why?"
"Monica";"What?! You can't—what did you tell her?"
"Ross";"I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposedto make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm"
"Chandler";"Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your bestfriends."
"Monica";"Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife."
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"That's true!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cuther out of your life."
"Monica";"No, you cannot."
"Ross";"Thanks for the help, problem solved. (Wipes his hands.)"
"Monica";"(answering it) Hello."
"Joey";"(on phone) Hey Mon!"
"Monica";"Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?"
"Joey";"See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TVand that's good exposure."
"Monica";"(Looking at the TV) You're not on TV."
"Joey";"Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the womannext to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)"
"Chandler";"Hey, there he is! There he is!"
"Joey";"Hello New York! (The woman bats his hand out of the way.)"
"Emeril";"(on TV.) Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Whocares, y'know? Now I got the legs…"
"Chandler";"How many times have I told you guys, you"
"Monica";"(entering) Hi Chandler."
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day."
"Chandler";"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing upcaterpillars."
"Chandler";"Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm, hey, umm, Joey'sgonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves."
"Monica";"Yeah, so?"
"Chandler";"Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the bestyou'd ever had."
"Monica";"Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass."
"Chandler";"Why?"
"Monica";"Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happydance.)"
"Chandler";"What's your point?"
"Joey";"(in a bored voice) PBS telethon."
"Phoebe";"(on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you knowthat I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me."
"Joey";"What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?"
"Phoebe";"Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The beeis happy and I am definitely not."
"Joey";"Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya."
"Phoebe";"(Thinks for a moment.) Aw, dammit! (Slams the phone down.)"
"Stage Director";"Back on in 30 seconds people!"
"Joey";"Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?"
"PBS Volunteer";"Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man."
"Joey";"Come on man! You've been here all day!"
"PBS Volunteer";"Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?"
"Stage Director";"We're on in 3, 2, (points to Gary Collins.)"
"Gary Collins";"Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying theperformance of"
"Ross";"(entering) Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is"
"Monica";"A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decisionwith a toy!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh, it's not a toy."
"Ross";"Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and loseone of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time beforeI'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I gotnothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then.Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads theanswer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads theanswer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!"
"Monica";"All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sextonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me."
"Joey";"(in an unenthusiastic voice) PBS Telethon."
"Phoebe";"(on phone) Hi Joey."
"Joey";"Hey Pheebs!"
"Joey";"$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness tolots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a goodthing, but I'm not"
"Joey";"And you don't a little good about donating the money?"
"Phoebe";"No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster."
"Joey";"A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, not the one I had my eye on."
"Gary Collins";"(on TV.) It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total!Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers…(Hewalks over to where Joey is sitting.) Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressedvolunteers, (Joey stands up.) Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV!Oh that makes me feel—Oh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and thereforeit's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)"
"Chandler";"(entering) Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there'ssomething you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best."
"Monica";"Keep talking."
"Chandler";"I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Whichwouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD."
"Monica";"Really?"
"Chandler";"Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with meagain, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!"
"Monica";"Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps intohis arms.) Oh my… When is Joey gonna be home?"
"Chandler";"Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts totake off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on."
"Monica";"But, I just cleaned the bathroom."
"Chandler";"Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves."
"Monica";"Yeah. (She takes them off.)"
"Chandler";"All right, let's show them how it's done."
"Monica";"Okay."
"Monica";"Ow!"
"Chandler";"Y'know that wasn't part of it?"
"Monica";"I know!"
"Rachel";"(entering) Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!"
"Ross";"For what?"
"Rachel";"For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes."
"Ross";"Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check?I'm waiting for a call from Emily."
"Rachel";"Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!"
"Ross";"It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff."
"Rachel";"Like what?"
"Ross";"Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants."
"Rachel";"Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help."
"Ross";"No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without yourhelp."
"Rachel";"Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if youneed somebody to talk to… Hi!"
"Ross";"Thanks."
"Rachel";"Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just giveit to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever shewants fixed. Just do it. (The phone starts ringing.) I mean, you're gonna"
"Ross";"(answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Lookumm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it.(Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know whatshe said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time notknowing what's going on.)"
"Monica";"Never done that before."
"Chandler";"Nope."
"Monica";"(quietly) Hi!"
"Chandler";"(quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.)"
"Joey";"Monica? What time is it?"
"Chandler";"Uhh, 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)"
"Joey";"But it's dark out."
"Monica";"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9looks like."
"Joey";"I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. (He goes into thebathroom.)"
"Monica";"I'm"
"Chandler";"I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time."
"Monica";"All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have achef thing."
"Monica";"Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have inJersey!"
"Chandler";"Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)"
"Monica";"Wait! What about Joey?"
"Monica";"(entering from her room) Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'mgoing to this culinary fair in New Jersey."
"Phoebe";"Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!"
"Monica";"Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conferencecould've been in Connecticut or Vermont."
"Chandler";"I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want peopleto think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference."
"Ross";"(entering) Hey."
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey."
"Ross";"Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her."
"Monica";"No, she's out shopping."
"Ross";"Damn!"
"Chandler";"What's going on?"
"Ross";"I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it."
"Phoebe";"Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna seeRachel anymore?"
"Ross";"Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see mywife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swigof"
"Monica";"Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together?How is that even gonna work?"
"Ross";"I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out."
"Joey";"Doesn’t seem like it's going to work, I mean…"
"Rachel";"(entering) Hi, guys!"
"Joey";"Hi!"
"Chandler";"Uh, hey!"
"Rachel";"What's going on?"
"Chandler";"We're flipping Monica's mattress."
"Joey";"So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and"
"Phoebe";"Yeah that's better than my way."
"Rachel";"Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?"
"Chandler";"Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)"
"Rachel";"(going through the mail) Oh look! A letter from my mom."
"Ross";"So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah! I know."
"Phoebe";"(To Chandler) Can you hear anything?"
"Chandler";"Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?""
"Monica";"Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?"
"Joey";"(holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and brokeup and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel atthe wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here."
"Monica";"Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles…"
"Phoebe";"Ooh,"
"Chandler";"Condoms?"
"Joey";"You don't know how long we're gonna be in here!"
"Chandler";"And condoms are the way to do that?"
"Ross";"Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked toEmily…"
"Rachel";"(interrupting) Oh my God! My dog died!"
"Ross";"What?!"
"Rachel";"Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!"
"Ross";"Le Poo's still alive?!"
"Rachel";"Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged fornine-(turns over the note)-teen blocks. Oh. (They all come out from Monica's bedroom) Ohmy God."
"Monica";"Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry."
"Rachel";"It's Le Poo."
"Phoebe";"I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better."
"Chandler";"(jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!"
"Monica";"Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!"
"Chandler";"Oh, you should live with Joey,"
"Monica";"Come here. (He does, and they kiss.) Okay, be right back."
"Chandler";"Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!"
"Monica";"We're switching rooms."
"Chandler";"(looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave usglasses!"
"Monica";"No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn'tchange the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come onsweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?"
"Chandler";"Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it'sfeed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)"
"Ross";"Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah! (Turns to face him.)"
"Ross";"Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there'sthis one thing… Okay, (Rachel has her back turned to the camera, and Ross isn'tlooking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Rossnotices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey!"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Ross";"You're nose is bleeding!"
"Rachel";"Oh God. (He hands her some tissues.) No! Oh not again! (Wiping hernose.) This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. (She puts her headback.) Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?"
"Ross";"Umm… (Rachel blows her nose.)"
"Rachel";"Sorry. Sorry."
"Ross";"Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore."
"Rachel";"Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either."
"Hotel Clerk";"I think you'll find this room more to your liking."
"Chandler";"Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)"
"Hotel Clerk";"(watching the chase) They say he's only got half a tank left."
"Chandler";"Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!"
"Monica";"We're switching rooms again."
"Chandler";"What? Why?"
"Monica";"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room."
"Hotel Clerk";"Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you."
"Monica";"(To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just asecond?"
"Chandler";"Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)"
"Monica";"Chandler!"
"Chandler";"(turning to face her) Yeah."
"Monica";"Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonnalet 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!"
"Chandler";"I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can youjust pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you."
"Monica";"Okay,"
"Chandler";"(watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This isregularly scheduled programming!"
"Monica";"Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entireweekend like this?"
"Chandler";"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
"Monica";"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!"
"Chandler";"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggageto 10 different rooms?"
"Monica";"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albanyto Canada on a half a tank of gas!"
"Chandler";"Do not speak ill of the dead."
"Monica";"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it,what is the matter with you?"
"Chandler";"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez,relax mom."
"Monica";"What did you say?"
"Chandler";"I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn.""
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Ross";"Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while nowand I really, I just have to get it out."
"Rachel";"Okay, what's up?"
"Ross";"Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix mymarriage?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants."
"Ross";"And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what shewants…"
"Rachel";"Yeah?"
"Ross";"…is for me not to see you anymore."
"Rachel";"That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? (Pause)(Realizes) Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?"
"Ross";"It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I wantmy marriage to work. And I do, I have to make"
"Rachel";"Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That"
"Ross";"You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard."
"Rachel";"Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just alittle bit easier for you."
"Ross";"What are you doing?"
"Rachel";"Storming out!"
"Ross";"Rachel, this is your apartment."
"Rachel";"Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!"
"Chandler";"Damn"
"Joey";"Hey, you're back!"
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Joey";"How was your conference?"
"Chandler";"It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, theentire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another"
"Joey";"Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?"
"Chandler";"Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator."
"Monica";"(entering) Hi!"
"Joey";"Hey, you're back too!"
"Monica";"Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?"
"Joey";"Hey, how was your chef thing?"
"Monica";"Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don'tappreciate really good food."
"Chandler";"Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but thenmade everybody vomit and have diarrhea."
"Monica";"Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.)"
"Chandler";"Monica. (Follows her out.)"
"Monica";"Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay myhalf."
"Chandler";"Okay, fine, $300."
"Monica";"300 dollars?!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!"
"Monica";"Urghh!!"
"Joey";"(sticking his head out the door) What are you guys woofing about?"
"Monica";"Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!"
"Joey";"Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myselfwithout twenties and"
"Ross";"You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! Idon't know what to do."
"Joey";"You want my advice?"
"Ross";"Yes! Please!"
"Joey";"You're not gonna like it."
"Ross";"That's okay."
"Joey";"You got married to fast."
"Ross";"That's not advice!"
"Joey";"I told ya."
"Ross";"I'm going to the bathroom. (Gets up and exits.)"
"Joey";"Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it."
"Chandler and Phoebe";"Yeah, me either."
"Monica";"Maybe I could do it."
"Rachel";"(entering) Hi!"
"Joey";"Hi, Rach."
"Chandler";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"Hey."
"Monica";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross buty'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just"
"Joey";"I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is rightback there. (Points over his shoulder.)"
"Rachel";"That's not Ross!"
"Phoebe";"Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though."
"Chandler";"Okay, Ross is in the bathroom."
"Rachel";"Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip."
"Joey";"Hey, you're not Kip!"
"Rachel";"(To Joey) Do you even know who Kip is?"
"Joey";"Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?"
"Chandler";"Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together."
"Joey";"Oh, that poor bastard."
"Rachel";"See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke upthey couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stayhis friend and what happened? He got phased out!"
"Monica";"You're not gonna be phased out!"
"Rachel";"Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother.(To Chandler) He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time beforesomeone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go."
"Phoebe";"Ehh!!"
"Rachel";"Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift rightout."
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left aneyelash curler in your room."
"Chandler";"Yes that was mine."
"Joey";"'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there."
"Chandler";"Yes that would have made more sense."
"Joey";"Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look,I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Wereyou, or were you not on a gay cruise?!"
"Rachel";"Phoebe? (She turns her head further away.) I'm sorry about the wholelifting out thing. (Moves over next to her.) You gotta come with me!"
"Phoebe";"Come where?"
"Rachel";"Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we'rethe best ones."
"Phoebe";"Okay, but try and get Joey too."
"Ross";"(entering) Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind hisback.) Forever."
"Ross";"Hi."
"Rachel";"Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?"
"Ross";"I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice."
"Rachel";"Oh, Ross…"
"Ross";"No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see theirsisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joeyat"
"Rachel";"No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you."
"Ross";"Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would youdo?"
"Rachel";"Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!"
"Ross";"I can't believe this is happening."
"Rachel";"I know."
"Ross";"I am so sorry."
"Rachel";"I know that too."
"Joey";"(entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorryto interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something."
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey!"
"Monica";"Hi."
"Chandler";"I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kindasucked, huh?"
"Monica";"Yeah, it did."
"Chandler";"So, I guess this is over."
"Monica";"What?"
"Chandler";"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime."
"Monica";"Why, exactly?"
"Chandler";"Because of the weekend, we had a fight."
"Monica";"Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight withsomeone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh! (They both realize somethingthere.)"
"Chandler";"So, this isn't over?"
"Monica";"(laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it andmove on! It's nothing to freak out about."
"Chandler";"Really? Okay. Great!"
"Monica";"Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)"
"Chandler";"(stops her) We're in a relationship?"
"Monica";"I'm afraid so."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention."
"Monica";"Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator."
"Monica";"Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine."
"Rachel";"Yeah, it's in there. (Points to the bathroom.)"
"Joey";"(shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!"
"Chandler";"Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to dragJoey into Monica's room.)"
"Joey";"Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!"
"Joey";"Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!"
"Chandler";"Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)"
"Joey";"(To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!"
"Monica";"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!"
"Joey";"How?! When?!"
"Chandler";"It happened in London."
"Chandler";"The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make abig deal out of it."
"Joey";"But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!"
"Chandler";"No-no-no-no-no! You can't!"
"Monica";"Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?Just promise you won't tell."
"Joey";"All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's"
"Monica";"I know, it's great!"
"Joey";"Aww, I don't want to see that!"
"Phoebe";"We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying totake Joey!"
"Phoebe";"The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And ifyou win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!""
"Monica";"Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count."
"Phoebe";"Count for what?"
"Monica";"Count in our heads as-as good"
"Joey";"I guess I'm done."
"Chandler";"Fun's over!"
"Monica";"Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it meanssomething!"
"Rachel";"Uh-huh!"
"Joey";"I think I'm gonna take-off."
"Monica";"Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave andclose the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're livingunder my roof!"
"Monica";"What?!"
"Joey";"Look, just because I"
"Chandler";"Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?"
"Joey";"Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! (Starts for hisroom.) And I'm also sorry if"
"Chandler and Monica";"Okay."
"Monica";"Sorry."
"Chandler";"Sorry."
"Joey";"(from the bedroom) I can hear that!"
"Monica";"(To Chandler) Rachel's at work."
"Joey";"I can still hear you!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hello!"
"Monica";"Hey, what's that?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to mygrandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I haveheirlooms for crying out loud."
"Phoebe";"Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's afur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)"
"Joey";"Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingersbloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.)That didn't happen, I made that up!"
"Ross";"(entering) Hey!"
"Gunther";"Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here."
"Ross";"How come? Everybody else does."
"Gunther";"You can't."
"Monica";"What is that?"
"Ross";"Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things."
"Monica";"(looking at the flyer) This is all of your things."
"Ross";"Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get allnew stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new."
"Monica";"So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale."
"Ross";"Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on."
"Gunther";"I'll take it all."
"Joey";"Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?"
"Ross";"Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and"
"Chandler";"Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?"
"Ross";"After what"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband saidsomeone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green."
"Joey";"(after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross'sfurniture has got Rachel coodies?"
"Monica";"Now calm down Joey."
"Joey";"No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross seeRachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing."
"Chandler";"Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…"
"Monica";"Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he'shappy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are youcool with that?"
"Joey";"No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool."
"Rachel";"Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on pleasehurry up honey! Please?"
"Monica";"Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to waituntil I find the little waffle iron."
"Rachel";"I want the little round waffles."
"Monica";"All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath thecan of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food isunderneath the can of poison?"
"Rachel";"Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!"
"Rachel";"Arghhhh!!!!!!"
"Monica";"Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!"
"Phoebe";"I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat."
"Joey";"I'll take it!"
"Phoebe";"That might work! (She gives him the coat.)"
"Joey";"Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (He drapes it around his shoulders.) Enh? All right,what do you think?"
"Chandler";"You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli."
"Ross";"(on the phone) No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. (Listens) No, it's great.Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. (Hangs up.)"
"Joey";"What's the matter Ross?"
"Ross";"Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily andit looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!"
"Phoebe";"Why?"
"Ross";"Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a freshnew apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river onone side and Columbia on the other."
"Joey";"That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.)Which is great! I love to ride that rail!"
"Chandler";"So you're really okay with this?"
"Ross";"Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll getso much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!"
"Chandler";"Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space.We should get them together and make a continuum."
"Joey";"Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? (Phoebe pinches himagain.) Ow!! He's not even here!!!"
"Rachel";"You guys! You guys!"
"Monica";"We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepyman!"
"Rachel";"It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like abigfoot or a"
"Monica";"And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!"
"Rachel";"(proud of herself) Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged hisyeti ass!"
"Joey";"Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?"
"Rachel";"Yeah!"
"Joey";"Yeah, you fogged Danny."
"Rachel";"Please! We did"
"Joey";"Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like thisfour-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella."
"Monica";"Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people wefog!"
"Danny";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"Hi! You might not remember us, but"
"Monica";"We're-we're really sorry we fogged you."
"Danny";"Okay."
"Rachel";"Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't"
"Danny";"Okay."
"Danny";"Yesss?"
"Rachel";"Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Monica";"Wow! That guy is so rude!"
"Rachel";"Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you."
"Monica";"Well you did a little bit."
"Rachel";"Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!"
"Monica";"I totally forgive you!"
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Monica";"Yes!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?"
"Monica";"Crematorium Chris? Sure!"
"Phoebe";"He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know,bring in the next person I know who dies."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!"
"Monica";"Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated."
"Rachel";"What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a bigkick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like acrime against nature! Not nature,"
"Phoebe";"This is fashion?! (Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay, so to you,"
"Ross";"(on phone) I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you.Bye. (Hangs up.)"
"Chandler";"Okay, what is in here? Rocks?"
"Ross";"No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples."
"Chandler";"So, rocks."
"Ross";"I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first stepsright over there. (Points.)"
"Joey";"Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing (The shutters that close offthe kitchen.) and it kinda knocked me out a little?"
"Ross";"I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move."
"Joey";"Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?"
"Ross";"Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…"
"Joey";"You"
"Ross";"Why?"
"Joey";"It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-(The gang entersbehind Joey and Phoebe pinches him again.)-Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guyssaid I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just toldme that he's not entirely happy."
"Ross";"What's going on?"
"Joey";"We all hate Emily!"
"Phoebe";"Nooo!!"
"Monica";"No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you'rehaving to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy."
"Joey";"Yeah!"
"Chandler";"Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable."
"Joey";"Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!"
"Ross";"Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guysgets married! You have"
"Phoebe";"I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much."
"Monica";"God, I feel so guilty about Ross."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I know."
"Joey";"I kinda feel like it's my fault."
"Chandler";"Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would'vehappened."
"Joey";"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was boundto slip out! (He glares at Chandler.)"
"Chandler";"Well, I think it's very brave what you said."
"Phoebe";"All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts onher fur coat.)"
"Chandler";"Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animalrights thing?"
"Phoebe";"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not verynice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I—it's the best thing I've ever hadwrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but stops and says toMonica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Danny";"So you like the short hair better."
"Rachel";"What? Yeti—I mean Danny?"
"Danny";"I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell."
"Rachel";"Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'knowif you hadn't looked so…. Y'know."
"Danny";"Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances."
"Rachel";"(shocked) What?"
"Danny";"That's cool. Cool. (Starts to leave.)"
"Rachel";"What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!"
"Danny";"Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog."
"Rachel";"So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't!Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!"
"Danny";"Do you?"
"Rachel";"Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants."
"Danny";"Okay. (Heads for his apartment.)"
"Rachel";"And stop saying that! I hate that!"
"Danny";"Okay!"
"Rachel";"Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And youare worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open upyour mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?"
"Danny";"The pizza-place across the street any good?"
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Danny";"I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more."
"Rachel";"Okay. Okay."
"Danny";"Stop saying that. I hate that."
"Chandler";"Uh, Ross?"
"Phoebe";"Are you still mad at us?"
"Ross";"Yep."
"Phoebe";"Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song."
"Ross";"Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood."
"Joey";"Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuffand I just acted like a jerk."
"Chandler";"Yeah, we are so sorry."
"Phoebe";"(To Chandler) You're kinda stepping on the song. (She gets ready to playbut is stopped by…)"
"Joey";"Look, we were"
"Monica";"Whatever you decide, whatever you do."
"Phoebe";"Okay,"
"Ross";"Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now."
"Phoebe";"Yes! Exactly! And that's why…"
"Monica";"Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner."
"Ross";"Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?"
"Phoebe";"Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing aseeing-eye dog coat!"
"Joey";"Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today."
"Ross";"You do, huh?"
"Joey";"Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotionsright at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. (Makeslike he's juggling.) Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wanderaround, you're alone…"
"Ross";"What are you talking about?"
"Joey";"(thinks) I'm not sure."
"Rachel";"(entering) Hi!"
"Monica";"Hey, look at you! Where have you been?"
"Rachel";"Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny."
"Monica";"How did that happen?"
"Rachel";"That yeti is one smooth talker."
"Monica";"I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready."
"Rachel";"Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room."
"All";"No! Why?"
"Rachel";"Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner youwith you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really… I don't mind."
"Ross";"Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It wouldreally mean a lot to me if you stayed."
"Rachel";"Ross, I…"
"Rachel";"Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down."
"Joey";"All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor…"
"Ross";"Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!"
"Rachel";"I haven't seen him in so long!"
"Phoebe";"Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!"
"Monica";"Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'llall be hanging out together."
"Joey";"It's almost as if he knew."
"Monica";"I'll get it. (On phone.) Hello. (Listens.) Hi Emily! (Listens.) Yeah, uhyou-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. (She hands the phone to Ross.)"
"Ross";"Hey! (Listens.) Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. (Listens.) Uh, yeah,sure uh hold on. (To the gang.) She wants to say hi. (To Emily) Hold on."
"Phoebe";"Hi Emily!"
"Chandler";"Hi!"
"Emily";"Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?"
"Joey";"Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn surewho's not here and that's Rachel!!"
"Emily";"(laughs) Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now."
"Ross";"Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here! (Rachel stops.)"
"Emily";"She's there?!"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, there-there she is!"
"Ross";"Yeah, yeah, she's here."
"Emily";"Ross, take me off speakerphone."
"Ross";"(on phone) Hi."
"Emily";"How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachelperfectly clear!"
"Ross";"(going onto the patio) Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends,okay?"
"Emily";"You obviously can't keep away from her."
"Ross";"Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friendsout of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'llsee you're the only person I want to be with."
"Emily";"I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all thetime."
"Ross";"Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is nevergonna work if you don't trust me."
"Emily";"You're right."
"Ross";"So, can you trust me?"
"Emily";"No."
"Joey";"I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling."
"Monica";"How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!"
"Joey";"You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. (He stands up and turns hisback to them so that he is facing the window.) Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. (The cameracuts to Ross outside hanging up the phone.) Smile! (Ross turns around and sees Joeyalternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads backinside.)"
"Ross";"Well, I guess that's it."
"All";"Why, what happened?"
"Joey";"What happened? What happened?"
"Ross";"My marriage is over."
"All";"What?!"
"Monica";"Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering."
"Phoebe";"Here. (She wraps her coat around his shoulders.)"
"Rachel";"Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?"
"Ross";"Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther."
"Phoebe";"(to the squirrel) Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they'remean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to becoats! (The squirrel stares at her.) All right, fine, now I get it. (To the clerk.) Here.(She hands him her coat.) You take it. (To the squirrel.) Are you happy now? I'm cold!"
"Chandler";"Are you looking at naked tribe's women?"
"Joey";"No, look. (Shows him the magazine.)"
"Chandler";"That's a pig."
"Joey";"I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her."
"Chandler";"Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)"
"Ross";"Emily's cousin kicked me out!"
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Joey";"Why?"
"Ross";"Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and thenyou get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back."
"Chandler";"How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?"
"Ross";"Who needs a lease when"
"Joey";"Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!"
"Chandler";"Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promiseme the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Ross";"You got it."
"Joey";"Okay."
"Ross";"Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna getpacking again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad."
"Ross";"What?"
"Chandler";"He thought you said gonad."
"Health Inspector";"Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have atough time making a living."
"Monica";"Oh, Larry."
"Phoebe";"Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?"
"Larry";"No, bribes."
"Phoebe";"It's okay to laugh right?"
"Larry";"Yeah, I was just kidding."
"Phoebe";"Okay. (She laughs harder.)"
"Larry";"I'll check the kitchen floors."
"Monica";"Okay, knock yourself out, Larry."
"Phoebe";"Yum-my!"
"Monica";"Larry?"
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors."
"Larry";"(entering) A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing yourchef's hat, and"
"Monica";"Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I knowthat you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen."
"Larry";"And where is your hat?"
"Monica";"It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it."

"Danny";"(To Gunther) Two pounds of Moca Java please."
"Monica";"(To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?"
"Rachel";"I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out.I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing."
"Danny";"(To them) Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hi Danny! (Notices his box of liquor he's carrying.) Wow! Thirsty huh?"
"Danny";"Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it'ssort of a house warming kind of thing."

"Joey";"Hey, all right!"
"Ross";"Pretty cool, huh?"
"Joey";"(To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?"
"Chandler";"Oh, the tears are real."
"Larry";"You look beautiful this evening."
"Phoebe";"(smiles) Show me the badge again."
"Phoebe";"Shiny."
"Larry";"Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and whoknows where these babies (Holds up his hands) have been."
"Phoebe";"(laughing) You are just nonstop!"

"Rachel";"Okay. (Closes the door.) Walked right into that one didn't he?"
"Monica";"What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he wouldknow I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. Isaid, "No!" Which puts"
"Monica";"Great. So the ball is in his court?"
"Rachel";"Ball? There is no ball."

"Chandler";"No-no-no-no!"
"Joey";"YES!!"
"Ross";"(entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbsup, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)"
"Chandler";"Okay, so he's out of here."
"Joey";"Um-hmm."
"Joey";"(entering) Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Joey";"You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chickenand it was closed!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut itdown!"
"Joey";"Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, whereare we gonna eat?!"
"Monica";"I don't know, clean places?"
"Joey";"Umm, yum!"
"Monica";"(looking through the peephole) It's Danny."
"Rachel";"Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala."
"Monica";"(to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say itstarts later?"
"Rachel";"What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!"
"Monica";"The fake kind!"
"Danny";"Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?"
"Monica";"We have a ladle. (Gives him one.)"
"Danny";"Thanks, see you at the party."
"Monica";"Okay, great!"
"Phoebe";"Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See youladle." (Laughs.)"
"Chandler";"Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports?International? Apartment listings?"
"Ross";"I'll take sports."
"Joey";"Mine! (He grabs it.)"
"Ross";"All right. Uhh, international."
"Joey";"Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!"
"Ross";"Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even thoughthere's never anything in here."
"Chandler";"Not even on page 7?"
"Ross";"(looks) Oh yeah! You're—hey, you're right! Here's an affordableplace, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!"
"Chandler";"What about that circled one?"

"Joey";"But it's available now! Isn't it?"
"Chandler";"Yes, it is."
"Joey";"Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)"
"Ross";"Okay, let's go."
"Joey";"Okay!"
"Chandler";"There we go!"
"Ross";"Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip inon some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it."
"Chandler";"Let's go quicker."
"Joey";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)"
"Chandler";"Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great!Y'know so you can cook while in the tub."
"Joey";"Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place."
"Ross";"I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking."
"Joey";"But hey, Ross, this place is available now!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks."
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Ross";"(To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?"
"Joey";"Oh, it's perfect!"
"Ross";"(To Chandler) How about you?"
"Chandler";"It's a kitchen slash bathroom."
"Ross";"All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs andfill out an application."
"Chandler";"We are bad people."
"Joey";"He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think wecould get a bathtub in our kitchen?"
"Larry";"(entering) Hey, ready for dinner?"
"Phoebe";"Ooh, absolutely!"
"Larry";"Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on BleakerStreet right?"
"Phoebe";"Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no."
"Larry";"How about Mama Lisettie's?"
"Phoebe";"Enh. Sure!"
"Larry";"(notices something) I wonder how long that milk (on the counter) has beensetting out."
"Phoebe";"Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That—this milk is mine. Ibought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. (She takes a swig of it, but hasto turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay, let's go!"
"Larry";"Hey, buddy! (Flashes his badge.) Are you familiar with Section 11-B ofthe Health Code that requires all refuse material out the"
"Gunther";"But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place."
"Larry";"Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry thehealth inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like,okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?"
"Larry";"Well, I suppose I could give him a warning."
"Phoebe";"Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go!(He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, Iknow a hot dog vendor who picks his nose."
"Joey";"Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!"
"Chandler";"Yes that was a nice place!"
"Joey";"Yeah!"
"Chandler";"Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out thewindow in a bag!"
"Joey";"Yeah!"
"Chandler";"What are we gonna do?"
"Joey";"I don't know. Maybe pizza?"
"Chandler";"About Ross!"
"Joey";"Oh! Oh!"
"Joey";"Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Rossput us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'llever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable."
"Chandler";"(grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh,barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tapdancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that"
"Chandler";"Ohhhhh!"
"Rachel";"Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!"
"Monica";"Just go over and say hi."
"Rachel";"No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home fromthe regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy."
"Monica";"Hey, Danny!"
"Danny";"Hey! What's going on?"
"Monica";"(turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food.Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying thisRachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quicklyretreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm,what's this? (Points to his plate.)"
"Danny";"Salad."
"Monica";"Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-andwhat-what's this? (Points again.)"
"Danny";"Bread. Aren't you a chef?"
"Monica";"(upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh."
"Danny";"Hey! Rachel!"
"Rachel";"Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party."
"Danny";"Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it."
"Rachel";"Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime."
"Danny";"Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back. (He heads off.)"
"Rachel";"Yeah, sure. (To Monica) All right, whose court is the ball in now?"

"Rachel";"Yeah!"
"Chandler";"98. 99. 100. Okay, go!"
"Joey";"(getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step andfalls flat on his face.)"
"Chandler";"Here we go! Here we go!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with myapplication."
"Joey";"You're kidding!"
"Chandler";"You're kidding, no!"
"Ross";"Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at herplace for a while. So…"
"Joey";"But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!"
"Ross";"Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space."
"Joey";"Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Pointsto where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards hisdoor.) by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!"
"Chandler";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"Are you guys sure about this?"
"Joey";"Definitely!"
"Chandler";"Yes! Ross, you have to stay!"
"Ross";"All right."
"Joey";"All right!"
"Chandler";"All right, buddy!"
"Ross";"So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a painin the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay?And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the'quiet down' maneuver)."
"Chandler";"Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think thecowboy hat is a little much?"
"Ross";"(popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!"
"Chandler";"All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on abonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?"
"Joey";"Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!"
"Rachel";"Oh Monica that was the"
"Ross";"I couldn't possibly eat another bite."
"Joey";"I need something sweet."
"Phoebe";"Does anyone wanna watch TV?"
"All";"Yeah, sure."
"Phoebe";"Monica your remote doesn't work."
"Monica";"Phoebe, you have to lift it and point."
"Phoebe";"Oh. Aw, forget it."
"Rachel";"Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game whereeveryone says one thing that they're thankful for."
"Joey";"Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having."
"Monica";"That's very nice."
"Chandler";"That's sweet, Joey."
"Joey";"Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze camein out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm alsothankful for thongs. (Note: Actually, I think"
"Joey";"I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. Imean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they playwith your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?"
"Chandler";"Are you aware that you're still talking?"
"Monica";"Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?"
"Ross";"Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or myeviction? Hmm."
"Phoebe";"Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything."
"Ross";"I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever."
"Chandler";"No-no-no!"
"Rachel";"Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents gotdivorced again are you?"
"Ross";"Oh God, no."
"Joey";"Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandlerbumming us out!"
"Chandler";"It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay,moved out, and abandoned its entire family."
"Mrs. Bing";"Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting adivorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with thehouse-boy than me."
"The Housekeeper";"More turkey Mr. Chandler? (And he makes eyes at him.)"
"Ross";"You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings."
"Phoebe";"I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse."
"Chandler";"Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?""
"Phoebe";"Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine'sworse!"
"Past Life Phoebe";"More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some morebandages in here! This man is dying—(She is cut off by an exploding shell justoutside the tent. When the smoke clears, she's missing an arm and the blood is pumping outlike you'd see in a horror movie. And upon seeing her condition, she says…) Oh no."
"Ross";"In"
"Phoebe";"Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse."
"Joey";"Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any pastlife memories."
"Phoebe";"Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new."
"Rachel";"I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving."
"Monica";"Oh, let's not tell this story."
"All";"Oh, come on!"
"Phoebe";"Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuckon his head!"
"Rachel";"What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!"
"Joey";"Hey, it's not like it sounds."
"Chandler";"It's"
"Joey";"(muffled) Hello?"
"Phoebe";"(surprised) Hello?"
"Joey";"Phoebe?"
"Phoebe";"Joey? What's going on?"
"Joey";"Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God!"
"Joey";"I know! It's stuck!!!"
"Phoebe";"(walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?"
"Joey";"I put it on to scare Chandler!"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!"
"Joey";"Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells"
"Phoebe";"Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a deadanimal."
"Monica";"(entering) Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey, did you get the turkey basted—Oh my God! Oh my God! (She seessomeone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?"
"Joey";"It's Joey."
"Monica";"What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?"
"Phoebe";"No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary."
"Monica";"Well, get it off now!"
"Joey";"I can't! It-it's stuck!"
"Monica";"Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at myparent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!"
"Phoebe";"All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think."
"Monica";"Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legsas wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!"
"Joey";"Sorry! Sorry."
"Monica";"Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!"
"Chandler";"Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in thedoorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)"
"Joey";"(pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!"
"Chandler";"I'm over here big guy."
"Joey";"(turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are!(Starts dancing.) I scared you!"
"Chandler";"(laughing) You did look like an idiot."
"Joey";"Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Rememberwhen Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternutbuash?""
"Ross";"Yeah that's the same."
"Monica";"That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving."
"Phoebe";"Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't evenknow that happened. So which one was it?"
"All";"Which one?"
"Monica";"Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story."
"Chandler";"Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is whatThanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians."
"Monica";"Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!"
"Mrs. Geller";"Monica! I think Rachel's here!"
"Monica";"I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One WithThe Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. Shegoes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!"
"Big Nosed Rachel";"Not for me. Chip and I broke up!"

"Rachel";"Okay,"
"Monica";"How?"
"Rachel";"Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex."
"Monica";"What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weightso that I can give my flower to someone like him!"
"Rachel";"Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna evertake it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're justgonna make him think that you are."
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Monica";"And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock thedoor and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!"
"Rachel";"Then, you will"
"Monica";"Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?"
"Rachel";"Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turnsyou on."
"Monica";"What do you mean?"
"Rachel";"Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!(She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good againstmy cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring itdown to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him."
"Monica";"(excited) I can do that!"
"Rachel";"Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler)Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)"
"Chandler";"Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous macand cheese like last year."
"Monica";"Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides tofollow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni andcheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Monica";"Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds thembetween her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-andhold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm,and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up aknife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder)and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have anyexposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and thebox between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)"
"Chandler";"Are you all right?"
"Monica";"Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that—(She drops the box andin a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flipsthrough the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)"
"The Doctor";"What do we got here?"
"The Paramedic";"Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot."
"Ross";"Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is!Severed toe, you"
"The Doctor";"It says here that the knife went right through your shoe."
"Mr. Geller";"Of course it did. They're made of wicker."
"The Doctor";"Did you bring the toe?"
"Monica";"Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She takes a bag of ice out of herpurse and hands it to the doctor.)"
"The Doctor";"(opening it) Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and—(Stopssuddenly.)"
"Monica";"What?! What is it?"
"The Doctor";"You brought a carrot."
"Chandler";"What?"
"The Doctor";"This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot."
"Rachel";"You brought a carrot?!"
"Mrs. Geller";"Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen."
"Monica";"God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!"
"The Doctor";"It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound."
"Chandler";"Without my toe?! I need my toe!"
"Monica";"Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your"
"Mr. Geller";"Oh, I'm not falling for that one!"
"Chandler";"That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!"
"Monica";"I didn't"
"Chandler";"That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!"
"Monica";"I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (Hestorms out.)"
"Monica";"Chandler! (Follows him out.)"
"Ross";"(To Joey) Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that."
"Joey";"You're a dork."
"Chandler";"I can't believe this."
"Monica";"Chandler, I said I was sorry."
"Chandler";"Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that criedall the way home! I"
"Monica";"Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)"
"Chandler";"Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I’m happy allthe time!"
"Chandler";"Nice try."
"Monica";"Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)"
"Chandler";"Look, Monica…"
"Monica";"Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)"
"Chandler";"This is not going to work."
"Monica";"I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)"
"Chandler";"You are so great! I love you!"
"Monica";"What?"
"Chandler";"Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, Ijust stopped talking!"
"Monica";"You said you loved me! I can't believe this!"
"Chandler";"No I didn't!"

"Monica";"You love me!"
"Chandler";"No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!"
"French Phoebe";"Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I pleaseget some gauze in here! (A shell explodes outside next to the tent and when the smokeclears, Phoebe still has her arm.) Whew! (Her arm falls off and starts pumping out blood.)This is getting ridiculous uh!"
"Phoebe";"What am I sitting on?"
"Chandler";"Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another butcan't) I'm out."
"Phoebe";"(taking something out of the couch) Ew-eww!! Undies!"

"Rachel";"Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?"
"Chandler";"Yeah!"
"Monica";"Yeah!"
"Rachel";"(waving them in his face) Take 'em! (Joey makes a noise and jumps out ofthe way.) Joey, you can touch them! They're"
"Joey";"(reluctantly taking them) Chandler? A word."
"Joey";"That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop!(Realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) Ahh! (Throws them towards Chandler'sroom.) And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?"

"Joey";"Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't…"
"Chandler";"(interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too."
"Joey";"Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!"
"Chandler";"Well, yeah actually."
"Monica";"We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't wanteveryone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going reallywell is because it's a secret."
"Chandler";"I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships."
"Monica";"We are! Help us!"
"Chandler";"Help!"
"Joey";"All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once."

"Phoebe";"Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff andumm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which"
"The Teacher";"How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's seehere (looks at his attendance sheet), Rachel Green?"
"Rachel";"Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story."
"The Teacher";"Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?"
"Rachel";"Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which"
"The Teacher";"Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here…"
"Phoebe";"(To Rachel) You completely stole my answer!"
"Rachel";"Well, honey that was pretty obvious."
"Phoebe";"Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!"
"The Teacher";"What do you think? You in the blue shirt."
"Phoebe";"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers."
"The Teacher";"Would ya care to venture one?"
"Phoebe";"Would"
"The Teacher";"Are you just repeating what I'm saying?"
"Phoebe";"Are you just repeating what"
"The Teacher";"All right, let's move on."
"Phoebe";"Okay then."
"Phoebe";"Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!"

"Ross";"(entering) Phoebe!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah?"
"Ross";"Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, butpeople at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller,yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that."
"Monica";"Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller."
"Ross";"That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports forme, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough withpeople you can get anything you want. (Joey walks by with a cup of coffee.) Hey Tribbiani,give me that coffee! Now!"

"Cynthia";"No, we just went out."
"Joey";"You're smart. I like that."
"Cynthia";"Oh, candles! (Notices something.) What is that? A blanket? A videocamera? Oh my God! (As she storms out, Rachel returns and overhears the conversation.)"
"Joey";"Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!"

"Chandler";"What is going on here?"
"Rachel";"And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?"
"Joey";"I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. (Pointsat Chandler, angrily.)"
"Joey";"You guys"
"Monica";"We're so sorry."
"Chandler";"Yeah."
"Joey";"Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain theunderwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!"
"Chandler";"No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell themyou"
"Joey";"Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found"
"Chandler";"Oh—I don't know."
"Joey";"Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!"
"Monica";"Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Justgive us a little more time."

"Ross";"Yeah, of course, Donald."
"Dr. Leedbetter";"We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on yourpart."
"Ross";"What?!"
"Dr. Leedbetter";"Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparentlypeople now call you mental."
"Ross";"(Proudly) Yeah."
"Dr. Leedbetter";"We want you to speak to a psychiatrist."
"Ross";"Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is allbecause of a sandwich."
"Dr. Leedbetter";"(laughs) A sandwich?"
"Ross";"Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Hersecret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it theMoist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here…"
"Dr. Leedbetter";"(laughs) Oh, you know what?"
"Ross";"What?"
"Dr. Leedbetter";"I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that."
"Ross";"You ate my sandwich?"
"Dr. Leedbetter";"It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone."
"Ross";"(getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkeysandwich with a Moist Maker?"
"Dr. Leedbetter";"No."
"Ross";"Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?"
"Dr. Leedbetter";"There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind."
"Ross";"(getting angry) That said it was"
"Dr. Leedbetter";"Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my stillbe in the trash."
"Ross";"(jumping to his feet in anger) What?"
"Dr. Leedbetter";"Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of itaway."
"Ross";"You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!"
"Ross";"(losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"Hi!"
"Rachel";"(sitting down) So umm, what's this book about?"
"Phoebe";"You didn't read this one either?!"
"Rachel";"Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else."
"Phoebe";"What?"
"Phoebe";"No! You should've read it yourself!"
"Rachel";"Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!"
"Phoebe";"Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's awoman, but she's not. She's a cyborg."
"Rachel";"A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time."
"The Teacher";"(entering) Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what dideverybody think about Jane Eyre?"
"Phoebe";"Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some veryinteresting insights."
"The Teacher";"Well, go ahead Rachel."
"Rachel";"Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading JaneEyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time."
"The Teacher";"If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right."
"Rachel";"Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots."
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Monica";"Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, Ithought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)"
"Chandler";"(gasps) You're"
"Monica";"I know."
"Chandler";"Ross?"
"Ross";"(in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!"
"Monica";"Ross, are you okay?"
"Ross";"I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today."
"Monica";"Why?!"
"Ross";"On account of my rage."
"Chandler";"Which I may say, right now, is out of control."
"Ross";"He gave me a pill for it."
"Monica";"A pill?"
"Ross";"Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave ofabsence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me atranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it."
"Monica";"Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?"
"Chandler";"And you're okay with that?"
"Ross";"I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I,I definitely don't care about my sandwich."
"Rachel";"(entering, angrily) Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe youlet me go on and on like that!"
"Phoebe";"(smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing"
"Rachel";"That was"
"Phoebe";"Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously."
"Rachel";"Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to besomething we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!"
"Phoebe";"Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know,people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to highschool."
"Rachel";"Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I justwanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?"
"Monica";"(yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!"
"The Teacher";"Monica, you"
"Rachel";"(sees the picture) Oh my God! That's Monica!!"
"Joey";"Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!"
"Rachel";"You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!"
"Ross";"(entering, with the rest of the gang) What's going on?"
"Rachel";"Joey has got a secret peephole!"
"Chandler";"(Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)"
"Rachel";"Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us!And then he eats chicken and looks at them!"
"Rachel";"Look! (Shows Ross the picture.)"
"Ross";"(covering his eyes) Dude! That's my sister! (She shows the rest of thegang.)"
"Monica";"(grabbing the picture) Give me that!"
"Phoebe";"All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's giveour friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!"
"Joey";"No! I am"
"Chandler";"All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this."
"Joey";"Thank you!"
"Chandler";"Joey's a sex addict."
"Joey";"What?!! (He turns around and stares at Chandler who's silently pleadingwith Joey to go along with it.) No I'm not!!"
"Monica";"It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!"
"Joey";"No! No! I am"
"Monica";"Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!"
"Joey";"No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!"
"Rachel";"Well, what is the truth?"
"Ross";"Yeah, what's going on?"
"Phoebe";"What's going on?"
"Joey";"(thinking) I slept with Monica."
"Chandler";"Well let's….let's see what everybody thinks of that?"
"Monica";"Oh no!"
"Ross";"You slept with my sister?"
"Joey";"Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London."
"Ross";"This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)"
"Rachel";"Monica, is this true?"
"Joey";"Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that'sbeen going on?"
"Monica";"Yes it's true."
"Rachel";"Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found yourunderwear in our apartment the other day?"
"Joey";"Ahh—oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London.Right Monica?"
"Monica";"I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir."
"Ross";"My God Monica!!"
"Chandler";"Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?"
"Joey";"No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has beentrying to get me back in the sack ever since London!"
"Phoebe";"So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself."
"Joey";"That makes sense!"
"Rachel";"And the video camera?"
"Joey";"Uhh, Monica?"
"Monica";"I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey."
"Joey";"But sadly I could not be enticed."
"Ross";"Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would youdo that?!"
"Monica";"I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants."
"Joey";"Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who'snot. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, sothe chicken's up for grabs. (Offers it to everyone.)"
"Phoebe";"I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you gotcut off."
"A Female Student";"Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?"
"Phoebe";"I don't know! I didn't come with her!"
"Monica";"(entering, happily) All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I justconvinced Paul to give us a test next week!"
"All";"A test?!!"
"Monica";"Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! (Running out) Weshould have essay questions!!"
"Joey";"What are you doing?"
"Ross";"I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy.(There’s nothing on the shelf.) Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. (There’sone lone tomato.) And top shelf: expired products. (The shelf is jammed packed.)"
"Joey";"Why are you doing this?"
"Ross";"Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I’ve already been to thebank, post office, and the dry cleaners."
"Joey";"Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You’ve got tospread it out a little, you know. Haven’t you ever been unemployed?"
"Ross";"Hey, I am not"
"Joey";"Hey, don’t get religious on me, ok. (Ross looks a littleconfused.) A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Whydo you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here…sit down. (Ross sitsdown.) Ready? (Joey flips the foot rest up.) Ahh!! (He reclines the chair fully.) Ohh,yeah!! Huh?!"
"Ross";"So what, we just sit?"
"Joey";"Ohh, no, no. We’re not going to just sit. (Joey sits down andhits the speed dial button on the phone.) Shhh. (It begins to ring.)"
"Chandler";"(Answering the phone at work) Hello, Chandler Bing."
"Joey";"(In a high pitched female voice) Hello Mr. Bing...I love you."
"Chandler";"(Angrily) Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (Ross andJoey laugh silently.) It’s been six months!"

"Phoebe";"Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to thepeople. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year,I’m going to do the whole city."
"Monica";"You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was"
"Joey";"So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?"
"Phoebe";"Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by"
"Rachel";"Oh my god. Ok you guys, there’s Danny. Watch. Just watch this.(He walks past the couch to the counter.) See?! Still pretending he’s not interested.Ohh, he’s coming over. Just pretend like we don’t know him. We’ve forgottenwho he is."

"Monica";"Friday’s perfect...She can’t wait."
"Danny";"(To Monica) On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? (ToRachel) See ya Friday. (He walks out.)"
"Rachel";"(Somewhat angrily) Okay. What the hell was that? You know what?Don’t answer me. (Giggling) I have a date with Danny."
"Joey";"How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italianactor from Queens."
"Estelle";"Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available."
"Joey";"She’s a woman!"
"Estelle";"What can I say? She nailed it."
"Joey";"(Very discouraged) Okay, is there anything else?"
"Estelle";"Well, you’re just going to say no again but...gay porn."
"Phoebe";"Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. (A man putsome change in her bucket.) Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. (She waves her hand up anddown as if she is spreading joy.)"
"Monica";"(Walking in from off screen.) Phoebe!"

"Phoebe";"Wait, you can't take the money out."
"The Man";"I'm making change. I need change for the bus."
"Phoebe";"But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor."
"The Man";"I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still…"
"The Man";"Bite me, blondie! (The man storms off.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just… (Shescowls at him.)"
"Joey";"That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!"
"Ross";"I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make somethinghappen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, whatabout those"
"Joey";"Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are thechances I could get those guys to star in it?"
"Joey";"Wait a second, I could star in it!"
"Ross";"Or that."
"Joey";"I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the disciplinethat takes, y'know? I can't do it."
"Ross";"I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick toit. And plus, it'll give me something to do."
"Joey";"Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!"
"Ross";"Yeah!"
"Joey";"Thanks!"
"Ross";"(grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. Theonly thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character."
"Joey";"Done!"
"Ross";"And it can't be Joey."
"Joey";"It's not."
"Ross";"Or Joseph."
"Joey";"(disappointed) Oh."
"Monica";"Hey, what's up?"
"Rachel";"I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his armaround her."
"Monica";"Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
"Rachel";"Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in ourrelationship!!"
"Monica";"You had no relationship!!"
"Rachel";"No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to theplan!"
"Monica";"Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl?Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date withDanny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subwaygirl."
"Rachel";"She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on thedate. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan."
"Monica";"Come on, hurry!"
"Joey";"Hey, how do you spell suspicious?"
"Chandler";"Why?"
"Joey";"Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff."
"Chandler";"Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler"
"Joey";"You're driving me crazy with that!"
"Chandler";"Okay, I'll stop."
"Joey";"Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!"
"Joey";"Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now."
"Chandler";"You wanna play?"
"Joey";"Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I haveto write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule."
"Chandler";"Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he getshome."
"Joey";"(jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up anotch?"
"Chandler";"I'm intrigued."
"Joey";"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid."
"Chandler";"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security depositback."
"Joey";"Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts."
"Chandler";"Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?"
"Joey";"Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to thedoor.)"
"Phoebe";"Thank you, Happy Holidays."
"Phoebe";"Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't… (The lady ignores her andwalks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yetanother guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that.(She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What isthat?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!"
"Ross";"All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stopsreading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey,you're supposed to have"
"Joey";"Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing."
"Chandler";"(entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing ovenmitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighterfluid—Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)"
"Ross";"This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor notthe creator of crazy lawsuit game!"
"Joey";"You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work."
"Ross";"(To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs towork. (To Joey) Now come on!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Ross";"No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!(After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him theburn spots on his oven mitts.)"
"Danny";"I had a really nice time tonight."
"Rachel";"So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out."
"Danny";"I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she'sasleep on the couch."
"Rachel";"You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? (Danny nods,"Yes.") Ohhh! I saw"
"Danny's Sister";"(opening the door) Oh, I thought I heard you."
"Danny";"Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, thisis Rachel."

"Danny";"You are! (Hits her back.)"
"Krista";"You are! (Hits him harder this time.)"
"Danny";"You are so dead! I'm gonna get you."
"Rachel";"(not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continueto ignore her.)"
"Phoebe";"Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people putin here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?"
"Monica";"No."
"Phoebe";"Does it look like an ashtray?"
"Monica";"No."
"Phoebe";"Does it look like a urinal?"
"Monica";"Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.)"
"Ross";"So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?"
"Phoebe";"Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. NiceBucket!"
"Monica";"Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'knowwhat? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with youguys. Sorry. (Leaves.)"
"Rachel";"(entering from her room) Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?"
"Monica and Ross";"Sure."
"Rachel";"Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guyswrestle?"
"Ross";"Oh-oh, yeah."
"Monica";"All the time. In fact, I was undefeated."
"Ross";"Uh, you weighted 200 pounds."
"Monica";"Still, I was quick as a cat."
"Rachel";"Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girlon the subway."
"Monica";"Oh, you're kidding."
"Rachel";"Yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?"
"Monica";"(laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now."
"Ross";"Yeah, not since I got too strong for you."
"Monica";"Too strong for me?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Monica";"You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wannago?"
"Ross";"Oh fine."
"Monica";"Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They startwrestling.)"
"Rachel";"Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.(She leaves them to wrestle.)"
"Chandler";"(entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in20 minutes! Come on, Joe!"
"Ross";"Joey's not going."
"Joey";"(To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages."
"Chandler";"Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?"
"Ross";"Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages."
"Joey";"Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work."
"Chandler";"(To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if herelaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done."
"Ross";"I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball."
"Joey";"Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have neverplayed."
"Chandler";"The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed."
"Ross";"I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!"
"Joey";"Come on look guys, don't fight."
"Ross";"And the reason I'm doing this is because"
"Chandler";"Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?"
"Ross";"If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine."
"Joey";"Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game ofFireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!"
"Ross";"How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now,no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!"
"Chandler";"I paid for those tickets!"
"Ross";"No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)"
"Danny";"…so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here (Hissister) forgets the camera!"
"Joey";"Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time."
"Chandler";"When did that happen to you?!"
"Joey";"Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that reallypretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging."
"Krista";"Oh, this is so good (A piece of cake.) you have got to try it. (Shetakes some on her finger and feeds it to Danny. Then takes a little more and does itagain. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang stares on in shock. Then they pick up a part of itand some filling falls into his lap.)"
"Danny";"Oh, damn! I got it on my pants."
"Krista";"Here, I'll get it. (She grabs a napkin and tries to wipe it up. Thething that gets the rest of the gang going is that she's whipping awfully close to hiscrotch. In fact, she is whipping his crotch. Chandler's about to come out of his chair.)"
"Krista";"We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set."
"Danny";"Yep. (To Rachel) I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight."
"Rachel";"Oh, great!"
"Chandler";"Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!"
"Monica";"That was unbelievable!"
"Rachel";"Okay, see? I told you!"
"Joey";"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach."
"Chandler";"I don't believe they're brother and sister."
"Joey";"They're brother and sister!!!"
"Phoebe";"Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look.(The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws thelint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)"
"Phoebe";"Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there andthen you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on hisface.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-workerwalk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thoughtI told you to get outta here!"
"Bob";"Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to aless high-profile spot."
"Phoebe";"What?!"
"Bob";"Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner."
"Phoebe";"That chick can't handle my corner."
"Bob";"Look, either you leave, or we remove you."
"Phoebe";"Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.)(The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out forthat bitch. (The old lady.)"
"Danny";"Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?"
"Rachel";"Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it."
"Danny";"What?! Why?!"
"Rachel";"Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond,and…"
"Danny";"Oh great! That"

"Danny";"Are you close with them?"
"Rachel";"No-no, they're not very nice people."
"Danny";"Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. Sowhat if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?"
"Rachel";"Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know itdoes sort of…"
"Krista";"(calling from the bathroom) Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!"
"Danny";"(seeing Rachel's shocked look) What?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. (Gets up and runs from the apartment.)"
"Chandler";"Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go downthere and give them a project, ruin their day?"
"Ross";"Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teachthem a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball."
"Joey";"(entering) Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I alreadyfinished my five pages for today!"
"Ross";"Yay!"
"Chandler";"Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!"
"Joey";"No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!"
"Ross";"I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you tofocus. Huh?"
"Chandler";"Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALLTHE LIVE LONG DAY!!"
"Joey";"Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it.And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. Sowould you guys read it for me?"

"Ross";"Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before."
"Phoebe";"Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet."
"Chandler";"That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find aplaneload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths."
"Phoebe";"Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially theones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane."
"Monica";"She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose thanyou do of not making fun of us."
"Ross";"In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year withoutmaking fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week."
"Chandler";"I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" (Ross looks at him.) And itstarts right now!"
"Joey";"All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar."
"Ross";"Ohh."
"Phoebe";"Really?! How come?"

"Joey";"Really? Who-who have you taught?"
"Phoebe";"Well, I taught me and I"
"Joey";"Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!"
"Rachel";"Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needingthese to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his deskdrawer, if you know what I'm talking about."
"Monica";"Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less."
"Rachel";"I don't gossip!"
"Rachel";"Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I passthat information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. Imean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?"
"Monica";"Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would."
"Rachel";"What? They were like this!"
"Woman";"I'll see you tomorrow."
"Ross";"Okay! (She leaves.) (To Chandler and Joey.) Hey!"
"Chandler and Joey";"Hey!"
"Ross";"I just asked that girl out."
"Chandler";"Nice!"
"Joey";"Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?"
"Ross";"Yes it is. See. (Shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her nameand phone number on it.)"
"Chandler";"(reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?"
"Ross";"That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle."
"Chandler";"Horn-swoggle."
"Joey";"You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?"
"Chandler";"No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sitsdown rubbing his temple.)"
"Joey";"Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! (Chandler is straining to keepquiet as Phoebe enters.)"
"Ross";"Hi, Pheebs!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth (Talking into Chandler'sear.) Hornswoggle."
"Phoebe";"Hornswoggle? (To Chandler) Ooh, this must be killing you."
"Ross";"All right, see you later."
"Joey";"See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson."
"Phoebe";"Okay. (Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no, you don't touch theguitar! First you learn here, (Points to her head.) then you learn here. (Points to theguitar.)"
"Joey";"Umm, okay."
"Phoebe";"Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of thechords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. (Shestarts to show Joey the chords. Transcribers Note: For this one you'll have to use yourimagination, 'cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. So if you want to seethem, you'll have to wait for this episode to come to a TV near you.) (Holding up her handand then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm,Turkey Leg and Old Lady. (Joey tries to imitate them.)"
"Chandler";"What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some mightfind it amusing, I myself find it regular."
"Phoebe";"Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all."
"Rachel";"I didn’t! Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let'sjust say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keepit. (Goes into her room.)"
"Joey";"Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. (Holds up his hand in one of Phoebe'schords.)"
"Phoebe";"Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! (They both laugh at what she said.)"
"Joey";"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today Istopped by this guitar store and…"
"Phoebe";"Did you, did you"
"Joey";"No."
"Phoebe";"Give me your hands. (He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings.Gimme it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) Pick. Do you want tolearn to play guitar?"
"Joey";"Yes!"
"Phoebe";"Then don't touch one!!"
"Ross";"(entering, with Ben) Hi!"
"Ben";"Hi!"
"Monica";"Hi Ben!"
"Ben";"Auntie Monica!! (He runs to hug her.)"
"Chandler";"(notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody elsesee that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on thepants!"
"Rachel";"I think they're very nice."
"Monica";"I like 'em."
"Joey";"Yeah! (Chandler bangs the table in frustration.)"
"Monica";"I like them a lot."
"Chandler";"That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generallywear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybethere's something in that area."
"Ross";"Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather storethat always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow, (To Chandler) I neverreally owned a good smelling pair of pants before.""
"Chandler";"Oh come on!! (Storms out.)"
"Ross";"(after he's left) Okay, seriously, what do you think?"
"Joey";"You look like a freak."
"Rachel";"Awful, absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe andMonica.)"
"Ross";"What are you, what are you doing?"
"Monica";"It's my New Year's resolution!"
"Ross";"What, to blind my child?"
"Monica";"No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really thinkit's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures."
"Joey";"Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (Does a chord and Monicastarts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to strike a pose with theexcessive amount of pictures that Monica takes.)"
"Ross";"(talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (He's stillwearing the leather pants.) (She snuggles closer.) Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! (Out loud.) Are you hot?"
"Ross";"Okay, it must just be me then."
"Ross";"That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if Iuse your bathroom?"
"Elizabeth";"No, go ahead."
"Ross";"Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without anotherword he heads into her bathroom.)"
"Ross";"(in ecstasy) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh………."
"Elizabeth";"(yelling from outside) Hey, my favorite part is coming up!"
"Ross";"'Kay!"
"Ross";"Oh my God!"
"Phoebe";"Tiger! (Joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord, in fact hedoes it with each name.) Dragon! Iceberg!! (He fails.) Joseph, did you even study at alllast night?"
"Joey";"Yes! Yes, I did."
"Phoebe";"Then do Iceberg!"
"Joey";"(thinks) (quietly) G-sharp."
"Joey";"What?! I didn't touch a guitar!"
"Phoebe";"No, but you're questioning my method!"
"Joey";"No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! (Notices Monicastanding between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera clicks, taking another picture.)"
"Monica";"Thank you. (Leaves.)"
"Phoebe";"Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid."
"Joey";"Your other student, was you!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!"
"Joey";"(looking in the Yellow Pages) Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher!Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture ofhim with a little kid and"
"Phoebe";"Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come cryingto me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play"
"Rachel";"(entering, singing) "Baddest man in the whole damn town.""
"Phoebe";"Oh, fine! Take his side! (Storms out.)"
"Monica";"(on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Rosspicks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours."
"Chandler";"(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel isabsolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)"
"Monica";"(on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…"
"Rachel";"Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace aroundwondering what to do.)"
"Joey";"(answering phone) Hello?"
"Ross";"(calling from Elizabeth's bathroom) Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!"
"Joey";"Uhh, Chandler's not here."
"Ross";"Well,"
"Joey";"Okay."
"Ross";"Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom…"
"Joey";"Nice!"
"Ross";"No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but theymust have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-Ican't put them back on. I can't!"
"Joey";"Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?"
"Ross";"Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! (Grabs some of her shelf.)"
"Joey";"Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some ofthe moisture and then you can get your pants back up."
"Ross";"Yeah, okay, hold on! (He puts the phone down and proceeds to spread alarge amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. Itdoesn't work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (Almost in tears.)They're not coming on man."
"Joey";"Umm, do you see any—oh,"
"Ross";"Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?"
"Joey";"Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there."
"Ross";"Hold on."
"Joey";"Ross? You okay?"
"Ross";"They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and thepowder have made a paste!"
"Joey";"Really?! Uhh, what color is it?"
"Ross";"What difference does that make?!"
"Joey";"Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourselfa pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!"
"Rachel";"(entering) Joey, do you have a minute?"
"Ross";"Dude, what am I gonna…"
"Joey";"(To Ross) Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it worksout. (He hangs up the phone and strands Ross in the bathroom.)"
"Rachel";"Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!"
"Joey";"Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all overthe place."
"Rachel";"Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have"
"Joey";"What-what is it, what is it?"
"Rachel";"Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannottell anyone."
"Joey";"Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!"
"Rachel";"Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!"
"Joey";"I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all thesecrets but can't tell anyone!"
"Rachel";"What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?"
"Joey";"And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!"
"Rachel";"I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up thephone… (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say, puts hisfingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeingthat Joey's not gonna listen, and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in hiscurrent state.)"
"Joey";"I'm not listening to you!"
"Elizabeth";"Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to getkinda freaked out."
"Ross";"All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off."
"Elizabeth";"No, let's just leave the lights on."
"Elizabeth";"Oh my God!"
"Ross";"I had a problem."
"Joey";"Hey, Pheebs?"
"Phoebe";"No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!"
"Joey";"Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your methodwas stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't toucha guitar until you say I'm ready. (After a short pause she hands him her guitar.) Youreally think I'm ready?"
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh!"
"Joey";"Wow! Cool! (He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note.However, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the tableand lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)"
"Joey";"(sitting back down) Was the chord at least right…"
"Phoebe";"No!"
"Chandler";"Oh my God!"
"Monica";"We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry."
"Ross";"This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'ma loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!"
"All";"No. No, you're not a loser."
"Ross";"Look at me! (Chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)"
"Monica";"Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! (Shows him Ben'spicture.) Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!"
"Ross";"Oh, be-because of the leather pants."
"Monica";"See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Nowthat's something."
"Phoebe";"Yeah!"
"Rachel";"That really is something; that's really cool."
"Joey";"Howdy partner!"
"Ross";"Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some withfringe all down the sides. (Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) I'm gonna go kissBen goodnight. (He starts to head for Monica's bedroom.) I can't believe he thinks I'm acowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monica's room.)"
"Monica";"Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna godo my laundry."
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep."
"Phoebe";"Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hangaround there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended."
"Rachel";"Good luck, honey!"
"Phoebe";"Bye! (She exits, leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)"
"Rachel";"Hey, uh, Joey?"
"Joey";"Umm?"
"Rachel";"Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?"
"Joey";"Oh, no! (Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pullinghis fingers out of his ears.)"
"Rachel";"I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would beokay and then we could talk about it. Right?"
"Joey";"Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah.Yeah!"
"Rachel";"(quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.) Hey uh Joe, would mind going over toChandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?"
"Joey";"Now? You want me to go over there now?"
"Rachel";"Yeah!"
"Joey";"Do you know something?"
"Rachel";"Do you know something?"
"Joey";"I might know something."
"Rachel";"I might know something too."
"Joey";"What's the thing you know?"
"Rachel";"Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know."
"Joey";"I can't tell you what I know."
"Rachel";"Well then I can't tell you what I know."
"Joey";"Okay, fine."
"Joey";"You don't know!"
"Rachel";"All right, how about"
"Joey";"(gasps) YOU KNOW!!!!"
"Rachel";"AND YOU KNOW!!!"
"Joey";"Yeah, I know!!!!"
"Rachel";"Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have youknown?"
"Joey";"Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about thisfor so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weirdabout that! Listen… (Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)"
"Joey and Rachel";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So…"
"Joey";"Oh,"
"Rachel";"Ohhh, yeah, me too."
"Phoebe";"That's weird. (Pause.) I bet they're doing it."
"Chandler";"(entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take itanymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs?Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your"
"Rachel";"Come on Joey!!!"
"Joey";"Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal,so Monica and Chandler are doing it."

"Joey";"Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love."
"Rachel";"No! I mean come on! This is a"
"Joey";"(thinks) I don't know."
"Rachel";"Is he romantic with her?"
"Joey";"I don't know."
"Rachel";"Are they in love?"
"Joey";"(thinks) I don't know."
"Rachel";"You don't know anything."
"Joey";"Ohh, I know one thing!"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Joey";"They did it right there on the couch."
"Joey";"Hey Ross!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Ross";"(disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I havea scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is gettingmarried! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!"
"All";"What? Oh!"
"Chandler";"Sorry man."
"Gunther";"Here's your scone."
"Ross";"Oh, thanks Gunther. (He takes it, hands the plate it's on to Rachel, sets it downon the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACKFOOD!!!!!!!"
"Chandler";"Did they teach you that in your anger management class?"
"Phoebe";"Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you andEmily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about theLouisiana Purchase?"
"Rachel";"Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that."
"Phoebe";"Exactly! Because it's in the past!"
"Joey";"(eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?"
"Monica";"Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are wecelebrating?"
"Chandler";"Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party."
"Monica";"I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be areal couple. We don't have to hide."
"Chandler";"I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)"
"Monica";"Ooh, and I can do this. (She kisses him on the cheek.)"
"Both";"We can't do that. (They separate.)"
"Doug";"Hey Bing! (Slaps him on his ass.) (Sees Monica) Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty ladyand what the hell is she doing with you?"
"Chandler";"I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this isMonica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica."
"Monica";"Hi, nice to meet you!"
"Doug";"Hi! And this is my wife Kara."
"Kara";"Nice to meet you Monica. Bing! (Slaps Chandler on his butt.)"
"Doug";"Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?"
"Chandler";"No, sir."
"Doug";"Yeah, Dewey, Cheatum, and Howe."
"Doug";"Come on honey, let's go drink our body weight. (They walk off leaving Chandlerand Monica alone.)"
"Monica";"What was that?"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Monica";"That noise you just made?"
"Chandler";"Oh, that was my work laugh."
"Monica";"Really? Your work laugh?"
"Chandler";"Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with onetoo."
"Monica";"All right, check me out."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Doug";"…says $30 Father; same as in town."
"Chandler";"Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!"
"Monica";"Really?"
"Monica";"Hey, I thought you already had one."
"Chandler";"Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Parkand hit rocks at…bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) HeyRach, do you have a tennis racquet?"
"Rachel";"Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back."
"Chandler";"Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)"
"Rachel";"(To Monica) Hey!"
"Monica";"Hi!"
"Rachel";"What's up?!"
"Monica";"What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day."
"Rachel";"Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with myfriend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new withyou?"
"Monica";"Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good."
"Rachel";"Oh y'know what, we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk aboutanything!"
"Monica";"Okay. Umm…"
"Rachel";"Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!"
"Monica";"Okay, what's going on with you?"
"Rachel";"Nothing! You go!"
"Monica";"Well, I-I—there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, butI don't anymore."
"Rachel";"Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y'know what though Mon, I actually dohave a lot of work to do so if-if—are you sure there's just not anything else?"
"Monica";"Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?"
"Rachel";"No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldn't tell you."
"Phoebe";"Okay, then what happened?"
"Phoebe";"(gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You'll get your turn!"
"Ross";"(entering from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs, what's going on?"
"Phoebe";"Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) Thisis not over!"
"Ross";"No! No! No!"
"Phoebe";"What?!"
"Ross";"I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect andnow it's all covered in-in… (The duck quacks.) Actually, thanks!"

"Ross";"Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it."
"Joey";"Really?"
"Ross";"Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now."
"Joey";"Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail andstuff."
"Ross";"That's okay, Joe."
"Joey";"All right, let's go Pheebs."
"Ross";"(licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) Oh God!"
"Doug";"Bing!"
"Kara";"Oww!!"
"Monica";"Game!"
"Doug";"Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger. (To his wife.)Are you all right sweethart?"
"Kara";"(out of breath and mouths) I'm not all right."
"Doug";"We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water."
"Monica";"Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to becarved!"
"Chandler";"Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game."
"Monica";"I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said."
"Chandler";"Let them win one."
"Monica";"Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she'spopping pills."
"Chandler";"You're not even giving them a chance!"
"Monica";"They have racquets don't they?!"

"Chandler";"Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?(Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!"
"Monica";"I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do."
"Chandler";"Oopsey, missed it!"
"Monica";"I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug andKara and scores a point.)"
"Doug";"Nice shot."
"Monica";"I got it!!"
"Chandler";"Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)"
"Monica";"I can't believe you let them win!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashedracquet from his bag.)"
"Monica";"I was frustrated."
"Chandler";"It was my racquet."
"Monica";"I was frustrated with you!"
"Chandler";"If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrownight."
"Monica";"Y'know what really bothers me? Is—it's how-how different you act aroundthem! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see youaround, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" (Mocks the fake laugh.) Igotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up."
"Chandler";"Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight."
"Monica";"I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night."
"Joey";"Maybe we should check the trash chute."
"Rachel";"Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute."
"Joey";"That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there."
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"There he is!"
"Monica";"Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.)Where the hell have you been?!!"
"Ross";"Just, y'know out."
"Rachel";"Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!"
"Phoebe";"What were you doing?"
"Ross";"I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while."
"Rachel";"You walked around all night in the city by yourself?"
"Joey";"(snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone."

"Janice";"Oh! Okay! (To Ross) You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! (Doesher famous, or is that infamous, laugh and exits.)"
"Ross";"Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say…"

"Ross";"I"
"Joey";"Damnit Phoebe!!"
"Rachel";"(entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted duringour entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell evenwhen I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!"
"Monica";"My turn? What-what are you talking about?"
"Rachel";"Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler."
"Monica";"What?!"
"Rachel";"I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll justtell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said,"Laundry? Is"
"Monica";"Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let meknow how that one turns out."
"Rachel";"Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone."
"Monica";"Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr.Big…(Thinks)…ot."
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Monica";"Mr. Bigot. He tells the most"
"Rachel";"All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you andChandler."

"Phoebe";"Uh-hmm."
"Joey";"All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removesthe waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) Andthey're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)"

"Ross";"Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening tome. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) Itis amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention."

"Gunther";"Here you go. (Serves them both some coffee.)"
"Ross";"Thanks!"
"Janice";"Actually, I should get going."
"Ross";"Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm onsabbatical from work, right?"
"Janice";"Yes! Yes! You did!"
"Ross";"Oh…"
"Janice";"What is wrong now?!"
"Ross";"This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First mymarriage falls apart and then…"

"Chandler";"Why would I be mad?"
"Ross";"Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don'tuh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends orgirls they're related to."
"Chandler";"(realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But youknow what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! Theyforgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well,but I want you to remember that"
"Ross";"Okay."

"Ross";"All right."
"Chandler";"And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) sevendollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write itdown—let's write it down!"
"Monica";"I can't"
"Chandler";"Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!"

"Ross";"Sorry."

"Chandler";"Okay, but now see you're crying!"
"Monica";"I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened atwork."

"Phoebe";"Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there."
"Frank Sr.";"So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, verysorry that I left?"
"Phoebe";"Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make adifference anyway, so you can just go."
"Frank Sr.";"All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father."
"Phoebe";"That's a defense?"
"Frank Sr.";"Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers onbackwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!"
"Phoebe";"You make up songs?"
"Frank Sr.";"Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how didit, how did it go. Umm. (Singing.)"
"Frank Sr.";"I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm… (Backsaway.)"

"Rachel";"What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!"
"Joey";"Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problemswith me."
"Ross";"What kind of problem?"
"Joey";"Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with thebag!"
"Chandler";"Oh my God!"
"Ross";"Nooooo!"
"Joey";"Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!"
"Monica";"Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag."
"Joey";"I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?(She's avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!"
"Rachel";"Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you arewith it… (Looks for help.)"
"Chandler";"Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)"
"Rachel";"…I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag."
"Joey";"I can't believe I'm hearing this!"
"Rachel";"Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’thave a bag, I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (Pause)controversial."
"Chandler";"Yeah umm, they're called wallets."
"Phoebe";"(looking out the window) Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy isputting stuff in boxes!"
"Rachel";"I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving."
"Ross";"Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes."
"Rachel";"Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt."
"Chandler";"And we're done with the chicken fried rice."
"Ross";"Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!"
"All";"Good idea! Yes!"
"Ross";"It would be so cool to live across from you guys!"
"Joey";"Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can,we have a can and it's connected by a string!"
"Chandler";"Or we can do the"
"Ross";"Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe Inever realized how great it is!"
"Rachel";"Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man."
"Phoebe";"It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'mgonna beat you to it."
"Ross";"(laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Rossquickly hurries out.)"
"Rachel";"Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly NakedGuy's bathroom. (Does so.)"
"Phoebe";"(looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Startsyelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothesoff.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!"

"Rachel";"Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get thisapartment!"
"Ross";"Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebestarts jumping to divert his attention.)"

"Rachel";"Y'know what you should do?"
"Ross";"Huh?"
"Rachel";"You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond withhim. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, ormy underwear."
"Joey";"I'm listening."
"Rachel";"(To Ross) See?"
"Ross";"That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've beenwatching him for like five years so"

That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sitthem down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guywho-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles."
"Chandler";"(To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party."
"Rachel";"Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't youjust pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that."
"Ross";"It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!"

"Ross";"Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gottarun. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)"
"Rachel";"And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law."

"Rachel";"Umm, Chandler, you"
"Chandler";"Wh-wh-why?!"
"Rachel";"Well, because she loves you and because you love her."
"Chandler";"Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!"
"Rachel";"Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you alreadyknow! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she'sa woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica."
"Chandler";"I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the onethat was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and thenthe new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what"
"Rachel";"No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, thatmakes everything different."
"Chandler";"Okay. It's not different at all, is it?"
"Rachel";"Not unless different means the same."
"Katie";"You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut! (She slaps herthighs, Joey jerks, and spills some of his coffee.)"
"Joey";"(sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny."
"Katie";"No, you make them funny. You're the funny one! (She punches him again andhe retreats to the arm of the couch.)"
"Joey";"Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I likeyou. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfullypunch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very"
"Katie";"Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make funof me because of my size! (She punches him again and almost knocks him off the arm of thecouch.)"
"Monica";"Isn't this great?"
"Chandler";"Hmm."
"Monica";"Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.)Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)"
"Monica";"Are you okay?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I'm cool. Casual."
"Monica";"What-what are you doing?"
"Chandler";"I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl thatI'm seeing casually."
"Monica";"Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!"

"Monica";"Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking aroundabout marriage and stuff."
"Chandler";"Well, you"
"Monica";"Oh and"
"Chandler";"Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!"
"Monica";"I do not have baby fever!"
"Chandler";"Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage andeverything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turndown the heat on this pressure cooker?!"
"Monica";"Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is aboutyou and all your weird relationship commitment crap!"
"Chandler";"Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in thehead--in your head!"
"Monica";"You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Racheltonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! Anddid you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)"
"Chandler";"Well, I did not know that."
"Chandler";"It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is,this is fixable."
"Ross and Joey";"Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely."
"Chandler";"By me?"
"Ross";"Oh, no!"
"Joey";"No-no."
"Ross";"Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture."
"Joey";"Yeah, big!"
"Joey";"Uh-oh, shht! The Misses."
"Monica";"Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?"
"Chandler";"Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)"
"Monica";"I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you."
"Chandler";"Just tell me what I need to do to make things right."
"Monica";"What?!"
"Chandler";"Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me howto fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again."
"Monica";"Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonnahave to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to bein a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)"
"Party Guests";"(chanting) Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! (Ross goes to investigatethe noise) Howard! Howard! Howard! (They're holding Howard above their heads.) Howard!Howard! Howard! Howard!

"Ross";"You chipped in?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars."
"Ross";"Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it wastotally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, theexotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be."
"Ross";"Yeah, but you're making me look bad!"
"Phoebe";"No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see youtalking to me and that's--I'm a hit!"

"Joey";"Nah."
"Ross";"(trying to get her attention) Phoebe?"
"Phoebe";"(ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying.(Laughs.)"
"Ross";"(tapping her on the shoulder) Phoebe? Phoebe?"
"Phoebe";"Ooh. (Turns to him.)"
"Ross";"Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?"
"Phoebe";"No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, allright? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?"
"Ross";"So uh, what did you tell them about me?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get somesympathy."
"Ross";"Ohh. (He cuts himself a piece of cake.)"
"Phoebe";"But somehow you came off as the bad guy."
"Ross";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that becauseI don't totally understand what happened there."
"Ross";"(trying a piece of cake) Ohh, this cake is really good!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!"
"Guest #2";"(sees the cake) Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! (Ross triesdumping it into a nearby plant.) Who would do a think like that?"
"Steve";"3-B!"
"All";"Oh yeah, aww!"
"Steve";"Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you thinkit's time you went home?!"
"Guest #3";"Yeah, leave!"
"All";"Yeah, get out! Now!"
"Steve";"Go back to 3-B, 3-B!"
"Phoebe";"All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something thatI would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand andPhoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-hedidn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likesRoss," and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with youguys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him Isaw that he's really sweet and caring and"
"Phoebe";"Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I justthought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then youcould look like the hero."
"Ross";"Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that."
"Chandler";"Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Isshe here?"
"Monica";"(raising her hand) I'm Monica."
"Chandler";"I need to talk to you, it's urgent!"
"Monica";"Okay."
"Chandler";"Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh,us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly andawkwardly gets down on one knee.)"
"Monica";"Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!"
"Chandler";"(getting out a ring box) Monica…"
"Monica";"No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!"
"Chandler";"Will you marry me?"
"Ross";"Oh-no. No. No."
"Joey";"What a bad idea!"
"Rachel";"Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)"
"Monica";"Chandler, why are you doing this?"
"Chandler";"I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this."
"Monica";"Chandler."
"Chandler";"I'm doing this because I'm sorry?"
"Monica";"Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is becauseyou're sorry?"
"Chandler";"No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty muchfourth y'know, behind being ready and actually"
"Monica";"(kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and Iwant you to think about how"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now."
"Monica";"Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I neversaid I wanted to have babies and get married right now!"
"Chandler";"Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to theseguys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)"
"Monica";"Who? Two divorces and Joey?!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Joey";"She's right y'know."
"Ross";"Yeah, but still, cheap shot!"
"Monica";"Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with thisrelationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that."
"Chandler";"I didn't think I was!"
"Monica";"Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?"
"Chandler";"Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend therest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped holein that door. (Points at the door.)"
"Joey";"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?"
"Ross";"No, I will not!"
"Joey";"Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it."
"Ross";"You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?"
"Phoebe";"Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello toyou last week."
"Rachel";"Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them tomove in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?"
"Chandler";"Okay, how long is this going to go on."
"Monica";"Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane youwere so, a long time."
"Ross";"This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a breakthing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one islaughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)"
"Chandler";"That's not funny."
"Joey";"That's not funny at all!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Joey";"What are you guys doing up?"
"Chandler";"Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, doyou know a six-letter word for red?"
"Joey";"(thinks) Dark red."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here foryou later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?"
"Monica";"(checks to see if it works) Yes, you are so smart! (Kisses him.)"
"Joey";"Aww, you guys are so cute!"
"Monica";"I know."
"Joey";"All right, I'll see you in the morning."
"Chandler and Monica";"Okay."
"Dream Monica";"Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!"
"Dream Joey";"Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed."
"Dream Monica";"Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dogbut…"
"Dream Joey";"Cat."
"Dream Monica";"Yes! You are so smart! (Kisses him.) I love you."
"Dream Joey";"I love you too."
"Rachel";"(looking at the bill) Uhh, we still need a tip."
"Phoebe";"All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel!(Donates it.) How much more do we need?"
"Rachel";"A couple of bucks."
"Phoebe";"Okay, dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; thiscould take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.) Ohmy God, this is a police badge!"
"Monica";"Wow!"
"Chandler";"Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don'tserve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? Ithink I can come up with something better than that."
"Rachel";"Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'mat the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzyhas been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers inhope.)"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey, you guys!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey Joey!"
"Monica";"Hey."
"Joey";"(To Monica) Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?"
"Monica";"Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?"
"Joey";"Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone'ssweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him."
"Monica";"I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you."
"Joey";"No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!"
"Monica";"Are you saying I smell bad?"
"Joey";"No! No, you smell like a meadow. (Pause.) I'm sorry. (Runs to thebathroom.)"
"Monica";"What's with him?"
"Chandler";"Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother wasshot by a hunter."
"Rachel";"(disgusted at Ross's antics) Ugh!"
"Ross";"(To Rachel) Yeah, I still don't know. (To the salesman who is hoveringnearby) I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couchthat says, "Kids welcome here." But that also says, (In a sexy voice) "Comehere to me!""
"Rachel";"What?! You say that to kids?!!"
"Ross";"No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies."
"Rachel";"Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch."
"The Salesman";"You picked a great couch."
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"The Salesman";"Yeah. Could you just sign right here please? (Hands him aclipboard.)"
"Ross";"Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much asthe couch!"
"Rachel";"Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!"
"Ross";"Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! (He signs the form andhands it back to the salesman.) All right Rach, let's go! (He picks up one end of thecouch.)"

"Ross";"Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it!Come on! Come on!"
"Rachel";"(Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to heramazement, she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!"
"Ross";"Yeah!"
"The Salesman";"You two are really gonna enjoy that couch."
"Ross";"Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. (He starts backing out of thestore.)"
"The Salesman";"Ohh, okay. (Laughs.) Something didn't quite add up there. (Rossstops, walks back to talk to the salesman, and in the process pushes Rachel up against awall.)"
"Rachel";"Ross!"
"Ross";"What's that supposed to mean?"
"Rachel";"Ross!"
"The Salesman";"Well you, her, I mean, she's very…y'know. And you'relike…y'know."
"Ross";"Not that it's any of your business, but we"
"The Salesman";"Really? You two?"
"Ross";"Yeah! Rach?"
"Rachel";"Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying avery heavy couch."
"Ross";"Then tell him quickly."

"Ross";"Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!"
"Rachel";"Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are"
"Ross";"A loser you did it with (To the salesman) 298 times!"
"Phoebe";"Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?"

"The Smoking Woman";"Yeah I can, it worked real well."
"Phoebe";"No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again."
"The Smoking Woman";"I won't! (Turns away) Until I have my next cigarette."
"Phoebe";"Hold it! (Grabs the badge) N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!"
"The Smoking Woman";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah that's right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book'em."
"The Smoking Woman";"Who are you talking too?"
"Phoebe";"Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, youapologize to the tree."
"The Smoking Woman";"I am"
"Phoebe";"You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (Thewoman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!"
"The Smoking Woman";"I-I'm sorry! Sorry."
"Phoebe";"Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!"
"Ross";"Okay. (Throws off the last cushion.)"
"Rachel";"Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?"
"Ross";"Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go."
"Ross";"Okay, go left. Left! Left! (The bottom of the couch is hitting therailing.)"
"Rachel";"Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!"
"Ross";"Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head!You can do it! You can do it! (She gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.) Okay.You got it?"

"Rachel";"Any chance you think the couch looks good there?"
"Phoebe";"…so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide.(Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!"
"Monica";"(cooking something) Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!"
"Phoebe";"I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds."
"Chandler";"Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You couldget arrested."
"Phoebe";"You could get arrested, right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare ather.) All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. (She heads forthe door just as Joey enters.)"
"Phoebe";"(To Joey) Hey."
"Joey";"(To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh."
"Chandler";"Hi, Joe."
"Joey";"Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here."
"Monica";"Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. (Holds out a spoon for him.)"
"Joey";"(backing away) What?! Why?!"
"Monica";"What is going on with you?"
"Joey";"Nothing!"
"Chandler";"Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!"
"Joey";"All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don'twant to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)"
"Chandler";"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had saidthat? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! Idon’t want to talk about it."
"Joey";"Well, it involved Monica."
"Chandler";"You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!(To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.(Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) Ilove you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)"
"Joey";"Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamtabout her like that since I found out about you two--ish."
"Monica";"What was the dream about?"
"Joey";"Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and"
"Monica";"Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love withme!"
"Joey";"It-it doesn’t?"
"Monica";"No!"
"Chandler";"No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealousbecause I've become the apartment stud."
"Joey";"That kinda sounds like your dream dude."
"Monica";"Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and wey'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too."
"Joey";"In the dream I did enjoy the closeness."
"Monica";"Um-hmm."
"Chandler";"Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, areyou attracted to her?"
"Joey";"(looks at her) Not really."
"Chandler";"Well there you have it!"
"Monica";"Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! (Looking at Chandler and slowlyrealizing what his point is.) But that's good that you're not in love with me, because youjust want a girlfriend!"
"Joey";"No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? Imean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, buty'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?"
"Chandler";"Well y'know, Monica and I were"
"Joey";"Friends first? That's interesting."
"Monica";"You become friends after?"
"Joey";"No, never done that either."
"Rachel";"(entering) Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom."
"Monica";"(laughing) That's right."
"Rachel";"(noticing him) What's up Joey?"
"Joey";"(in a sexy voice) How you doin'?"
"Phoebe";"Excuse me, is this your car?"
"Guy";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you'reblocking the entrance."
"Guy";"Don't worry about it. It's not a problem."
"Phoebe";"Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'causeI'm a cop. (Shows the badge.)"
"Guy";"(he reaches into the car and slams his siren on the roof.) So am I!"
"Phoebe";"Ohh, no. (Pause) Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can parkanywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work.10-4. (Tries to leave.)"
"Cop";"(stopping her) Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?"
"Phoebe";"I-I'm with the umm, the 57"
"Cop";"Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there."
"Phoebe";"I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore."
"Cop";"Who-who else is in vice up there?"
"Phoebe";"Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?"
"Cop";"Sipowicz? No, I don't think so."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, big guy, kinda bald."
"Cop";"No, I don't know him."
"Phoebe";"(starts to walk away, but stops) Don’t try to call him or anything,'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died."
"Cop";"Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss."
"Phoebe";"I-I sure will, take care. (Starts walking off.)"
"Cop";"(following her) Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. Iheard that kid from"
"Phoebe";"Oh. (She starts laughing. Then she throws the badge at him and runsaway.)"
"Rachel";"Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?"
"Joey";"Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I canblow that off, (In a sexy voice) for you."
"Rachel";"Thanks!"
"Joey";"Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talkingto Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight."
"Rachel";"I know."
"Joey";"Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'mthinking of getting me one of those."
"Rachel";"What's up Joe?"
"Joey";"Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…"
"Rachel";"Yeah?"
"Joey";"…is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself,"Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So…"
"Rachel";"(laughing) What are you saying?"
"Joey";"I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch."
"Rachel";"Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw mefirst, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up."
"Joey";"I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.)"

"Ross";"Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me."
"Rachel";"(entering) Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements."
"Ross";"Oh great! What, you brought Joey?"
"Rachel";"Well, I brought the next best thing."
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey!"
"Ross";"Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!"
"Chandler";"Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…"
"Ross";"Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. (Showing them) OkayRach, (points to the sketch) that's you. That's the couch. (Points again.)"
"Rachel";"Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? (Points.)"
"Ross";"Oh, that's me."
"Rachel";"Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself."
"Ross";"No! That's-that's my arm!"
"Chandler";"(looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, reallyliked your new couch."
"Ross";"Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead."
"Rachel";"Okay!"
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Ross";"Come on, Chandler."
"Ross";"All right. (They start up the stairs. Ross is first.) Okay, here we go!"

"Chandler and Rachel";"You think?!"
"Ross";"All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again."
"Chandler";"Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now."
"Ross";"I can't believe that didn't work!"
"Rachel";"I know, me neither! I mean, you"
"Chandler";"Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?"
"Joey";"Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. (Starts for his room.)"
"Chandler";"(stopping him) Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?"
"Joey";"Uhh, well, she's…really good in bed."
"Monica";"Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!"
"Joey";"(To Rachel) Well look, hey, it's all your fault!"
"Rachel";"What?! Why?!"
"Joey";"Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! Assoon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. Isuddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And herroommate!"
"Monica";"What about the closeness?"

"Rachel";"Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!"
"Phoebe";"Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you (Points at all of them) with me.(They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luckChandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. Butyou'll never make it stick and you know it!"
"Cop";"Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understandright?"
"Phoebe";"Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and oncehe puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!"
"Cop";"I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest youtoday. Maybe I came by and you weren't here."
"Phoebe";"I would"
"Cop";"Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if youwould like to go to dinner with me?"
"Phoebe";"Me?!"
"Cop";"Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinkingabout you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen."
"Chandler and Joey";"Nice!"
"Phoebe";"Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!"
"Cop";"Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me."
"Phoebe";"Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer…"

"Gary";"Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it throughthe computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out."
"Phoebe";"Ohh, impressive."
"Gary";"Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record andyou've done some pretty weird stuff."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, we'll talk at dinner."
"Gary";"Okay. (He starts to leave.) So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick youup?"
"Phoebe";"All right, I can't wait!"
"Gary";"Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts."
"Chandler";"(To Rachel) He"
"Ross";"I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it."
"The Saleswoman";"You wanna return this couch? (Ross nods yes.) It's cut in half!"
"Ross";"That's what I'm telling you."
"The Saleswoman";"Did you cut this couch in half?"
"Ross";"This couch, is cut in"
"The Saleswoman";"You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!"
"Ross";"Look, I am a reasonable man. I"
"The Saleswoman";"I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars."
"Ross";"(thinks) I take it."
"Rachel";"Good, you guys are all here!"
"Ross";"Hey! What's up?"
"Rachel";"Well, I have a job interview at"
"All";"Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!"
"Rachel";"I know!"
"Joey";"Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!"
"Rachel";"Wh-what?!"

"Rachel";"Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'llwork right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!"
"Phoebe";"Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"You wanna work on your interview skills?"
"Rachel";"O-okay!"
"Phoebe";"Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi."
"Rachel";"Hi."
"Phoebe";"Very good handshake, good wrist action."
"Monica";"Let me try. (Gets up to join them.)"
"Phoebe";"Okay. (They shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) Oh my God! What didI ever do to you?! (Rubbing her hand.)"
"Monica";"Did I squeeze it too hard?"
"Phoebe";"Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler."
"Joey";"That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can seeme! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as the day before."
"Monica";"Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?"
"Joey";"Nope. Op, wait! There he goes."
"Joey";"(waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that awoman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.)(Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl inRoss's building is flirting with me."
"Monica";"Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!"
"Joey";"Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. (He turns back to the woman.) Okay, heregoes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Doesa little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. Shesmiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.)Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor…"
"Monica";"(joining him) Wow! She is pretty, huh?"
"Joey";"Tell me about it, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no,I'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monicaaway and makes a disgusted face.)"
"Ross";"Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?"
"Joey";"This is your place?"
"Ross";"Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you canpretend to be surfing. (He pretends he's surfing by the window.)"
"Joey";"But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! (Runs away.)"
"Joey";"Ugh!!"
"Monica";"What happened?"
"Joey";"I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something.(Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels onhis remote.)"
"Monica";"No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV."
"Gary";"Okay, now I've really have to go!"
"Phoebe";"But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'causesome guy shot at a store clerk."
"Gary";"I know, but it's my job, sweethart!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, then maybe I can come too!"
"Phoebe";"All right, you go. (They kiss.)"
"Gary";"Bye-bye."
"Phoebe";"'Kay, bye!"
"Phoebe";"Oh God!"
"Monica";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Oh I just miss him so much!"
"Monica";"Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like thislittle puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just"
"Monica";"I know it is the best."
"Phoebe";"So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?"
"Monica";"What? It's still going on."
"Phoebe";"Come on, seriously! When did it end?"
"Monica";"I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time."
"Phoebe";"Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious."
"Monica";"(Start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.) (Jumping up) What don't youjust calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don’t you just get all your facts before yourun around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!"
"Phoebe";"(Under her breath) God, I woke the beast. Sorry. (To Monica) I was"
"Monica";"Oh no, it"
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey Monica, here's your broom back."
"Monica";"You are so cute. (She goes over and kisses him passionately.)"
"Chandler";"Oh hey, how'd the interview go?"
"Rachel";"Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!"
"Joey";"Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fallright out of your chair?"
"Rachel";"No!"
"Chandler";"So what happened?"
"Rachel";"Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? Ieven made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! Ifyou've got enough life jackets!" (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are notamused.) Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-byeand ugh!"
"Joey";"What happened?"
"Rachel";"(We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right, wewere shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me… Y'know maybe he was going to openthe door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh… (The flashback shows that shekissed him on the cheek.)"
"Joey";"You kissed him?!"
"Rachel";"Well, I didn't know what else to do!"
"Chandler";"Well you coulda tried, not kissing him."
"Rachel";"Thanks Chandler."
"Monica";"(entering from the bathroom) Hey Rach, a guy from"
"Rachel";"I can't believe it! I got a second interview!"
"Monica";"Yes!"
"Joey";"I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?"
"Rachel";"What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?"
"Joey";"Yeah! (Chandler makes a noise) No?"
"Monica";"A kiss? What are you talking about?"
"Rachel";"I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me backy'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!""
"Chandler";"Come on, Rach."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would justsleep with him?"
"Monica";"He probably wants you back because you're right for the job."
"Rachel";"Maybe. I-I don't know—Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!"
"Joey";"Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey.Come on. Come on. (She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.) She's back! Hot girl'sback!"
"Rachel";"Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you."
"Joey";"No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to thewindow.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second.(He counts where she is again.) Got it! (Runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)"
"Chandler";"I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizessomething, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her andkisses her.)"
"Joey";"Damnit!! Did you move?!"
"Ross";"Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. (Joeyjust stares at him) I'm Ross."
"The Old Man";"Yes?"
"Joey";"(Looking around) Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?"
"The Old Man";"No. I'm all alone."
"Joey";"Yeah. Sorry about that. (He walks away and knocks on the next door whichis answered by a little girl.) Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, orbabysitter by any chance a hot girl?"
"The Little Girl";"Daddy!!"
"Joey";"Later! (He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a wholeother corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.) Hot girl! Hot girl!!"
"Mr. Zelner";"Hi Rachel!"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Mr. Zelner";"Come on in."
"Mr. Zelner";"It's really nice to see you again."
"Rachel";"Thank you."
"Mr. Zelner";"(Sees that she has some ink on her lip from her pen.) Oh Rachel,uhh… (He points to his lip to get her to notice the ink on hers.)"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Mr. Zelner";"Just ah… (He points again.)"
"Rachel";"Excuse me?"
"Mr. Zelner";"Here let me… (He goes to wipe it off himself.)"
"Rachel";"(stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's goingon here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am"
"Rachel";"(entering) Ugh, you will not"
"Rachel";"Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?"
"Ross";"You got ink on your lip."
"Rachel";"Oh. (Realizes.) Ohhhhhhhhh…."
"Chandler";"(To Gary) So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?"
"Gary";"I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that."
"Chandler";"Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you… (He gestures and spillssome of his coffee.)"
"Gary";"Yeah, I'm gonna say no."
"Monica";"Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?"
"Phoebe";"Oh we can't, we already have plans."
"Monica";"What are you doing?"
"Phoebe";"Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is soamazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie."
"Monica";"(That annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck"
"Phoebe";"You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?"
"Monica";"Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me andChandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah!"
"Monica";"Okay. (She gets up and walks over to Chandler.) Chandler? Can I see youfor a second?"
"Chandler";"Uh, yeah."
"Monica";"Okay. (They walk away to get some privacy.) We have"
"Chandler";"Why?"
"Monica";"'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!"
"Chandler";"Ohh, so?"
"Monica";"So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove themwrong!"
"Chandler";"Monica, you have"
"Ross";"(to the woman checking her mail next to him) Hey!"
"The Man";"(To Ross) Excuse me. (He puts up a flyer that has a sketch drawing ofJoey and it reads, "Warning! Intruder! If you see this creep - call the cops!")You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around lookingfor some kind of a hot girl."
"Ross";"(to the woman checking her mail) Who isn't?"
"Ross";"I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross."
"The Hot Girl";"I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman."
"Ross";"Nevermind! (Goes back to his mailbox.)"
"The Hot Girl";"No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. Imean you had just moved in."
"Ross";"I"
"The Hot Girl";"Jen."
"Ross";"Jen, I know this may sound a little…(makes some kind of crazy noise)But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or…"
"Jen";"Sure! That would be nice."
"Ross";"Umm?"
"Jen";"Oh! My number is on there. (Hands him a business card.) Give me a call."
"Ross";"I will give you a call."
"Jen";"I'll see you later. (Starts to walk away.)"
"Ross";"Okay!"
"Jen";"I forgot my paper. (Ross quickly hides the card in his mouth.)"
"Chandler";"That was amazing!"
"Monica";"Phoebe and Gary are"
"Chandler";"That was amazing."
"Monica";"We are the hottest! Huh?"
"Chandler";"No, you're the best."
"Monica";"No, you're the best."
"Chandler";"No, you're the best."
"Monica";"I"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'?(Has a silly grin.)"
"Monica";"(looking out the window) Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at youthe other day?"
"Joey";"I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. (He looks out the window.)Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet heranyway."
"Monica";"Why?"
"Joey";"Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like ofhot girl parallel universe, or something."
"Monica";"What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviouslylives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!"
"Joey";"No. No. No. She lives on the"
"Monica";"No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the lobby. And y'know theother one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong."
"Joey";"I did"
"Ross";"So uhh, you ready?"
"Jen";"Sure, I'll just get my coat. (There's a knock on the door.) Could you getthat?"
"Ross";"Sure. (He opens the door to Joey. Needless to say, Joey's stunned.)Joey…"
"Joey";"Dahhhhh!! (Ross has a puzzled look on his face.) No! Noooo!! (Storms off.)"
"Rachel";"Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again."
"Mr. Zelner";"That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that thismeeting is being videotaped."
"Rachel";"(looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm, well, first I would like tostart by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you."
"Mr. Zelner";"Fair enough."
"Rachel";"Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (Sheputs her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to puther hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a bigmistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage.When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity.And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizesthat she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know yougotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances inthe workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want tolitigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didn't want to sue him.  Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (countsthem off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, andnot litigious. Look Mr…"
"Mr. Zelner";"Zelner."
"Rachel";"Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think,I think I would be really good at it."
"Mr. Zelner";"Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot."
"Rachel";"(gasps) Oh! You are?"
"Mr. Zelner";"Um-hmm."
"Rachel";"Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh, would it be completely inappropriateto give you a hug?"
"Mr. Zelner";"Yes!"
"Rachel";"Okay, well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand butmisses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean totouch that—I mean"
"Phoebe";"You tired Chandler?"
"Monica";"You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what Imean. You know what I mean?"
"Chandler";"Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean."
"Gary";"So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to thelining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee.(Heads for the bathroom.)"
"Monica";"Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair."
"Phoebe";"Ohh, (laughs) umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here."
"Gary";"Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so…"
"Monica";"You didn't!"
"Phoebe";"We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!"
"Monica";"The park huh? A public place."
"Gary";"Uh-huh."
"Monica";"I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! (Gets up and heads for thebathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)"
"Monica";"Hi Chandler."
"Chandler";"Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?"
"Monica";"Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual.Haven't you?"
"Chandler";"No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this isgetting ridiculous!"
"Monica";"Come on, we"
"Chandler";"Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are yougetting so obsessed about this thing?!"
"Monica";"Because Phoebe and Gary are inthat-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!"
"Chandler";"(gasps) So?"
"Monica";"I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore."
"Chandler";"Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?"
"Monica";"Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each otherall the time?"
"Chandler";"Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth,I'm more excited about where we are right now."
"Monica";"Really?"
"Chandler";"Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this longbefore. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, Ithink that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah Ithink that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)"
"Monica";"That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, Ifeel the same way."
"Chandler";"Yeah?"
"Monica";"Yeah. (They hug.)"
"Chandler";"Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about ourrelationship."
"Monica";"Did not."
"Chandler";"Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!"
"Monica";"Okay, I freaked out a little."
"Chandler";"Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We haveswitched places!"
"Rachel";"(laughs) I cannot believe Ross is buying this!"
"Monica";"Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!"
"Chandler";"(entering) You guys ready fore the movies?"
"Rachel";"Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine."
"Ross";"(from his apartment) Man! They cannot get enough! (Makes like he's a robotand waves at the cutouts.)"
"Joey";"Okay, pick a card."
"Chandler";"Okay. (He picks the 9 of Spades)"
"Joey";"All right now, memorize it. (Pause) You got it?"
"Chandler";"Oh yes."
"Joey";"(holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)"
"Chandler";"(pause) Yes."
"Carol";"(entering with Ben and Ross) Hey guys!"
"Ross";"Hi!"
"Chandler";"Hi there!"
"Ben";"Hi!!"
"Carol";"Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!"
"Phoebe";"What are you talking about?!"
"Ross";"(sets Ben down) Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in thepark who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gaveus his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning."
"Joey";"(reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial castingdirector in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!(Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to goBen! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a milliontimes and no one offered me an audition."
"Ross";"I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings…"
"Joey";"I'm"
"Chandler";"That."
"Rachel";"(entering from her room) Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!"
"Joey";"Luck!"
"Chandler";"Hey Rach, now that you're working at"
"Rachel";"Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on myvery"
"Chandler";"Unwilling to steal from work, interesting."
"Monica";"Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me."
"Rachel";"Okay guys, way to wish me luck!"
"All";"Good luck! Go get 'em! (Rachel exits.)"
"Phoebe";"Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise partythis weekend."
"Joey";"Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month."
"Phoebe";"Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not asurprise."
"Monica";"I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and justinvite her close friends."
"Joey";"Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!"
"Ross";"(from the bathroom) Okay!!"
"Joey";"Done."
"Phoebe";"Okay, great so do you want to do it together?"
"Monica";"I would love to do it together!"
"Joey";"They're gonna do it together."
"Chandler";"Dude! That's my girlfriend!"
"Joey";"What, so I gotta shut it down now?"
"Ross";"All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the bigaudition."
"Monica";"It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad."
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods inagreement.)"
"Joey";"Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?"
"Ross";"Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it."
"Joey";"Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get anaudition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather."
"Ross";"You're not his godfather."
"Joey";"What?! Are you kidding?!"
"Ross";"(Pause) Of course I am! (Joey is relieved) Okay, let's go godfather."
"Joey";"All right!"
"Joey";"Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!"
"Ross";"Really? That's great!"
"Joey";"I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actuallyseen me in a play, so I steered clear of her…"
"Carol";"(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of"
"Joey";"Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like SugarSmacks,"
"Ross";"Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. Imean look at him, look at you, (Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him.)"
"Joey";"That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben'sdad?"
"Ross";"Joey, you look nothing like Ben."
"Joey";"I look more like him than you do! (He winks at Carol.)"
"Carol";"Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that."
"Kim";"So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think Iagree. Rachel, what do you think?"
"Rachel";"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric (Onthe other one.) Sorry."
"Kim";"Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions andthen I take credit for them--I'm kidding."
"Nancy";"She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'mkidding!"
"Rachel";"(laughing nervously) Oh, what a fun office."
"Kim";"I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do yousay we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?"
"Kim";"(at the door) Rachel? Do you smoke?"
"Rachel";"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horrorstories…(stops and tries to change directions)…about ghosts and goblins whototally supported the princess's right to smoke."
"Rachel";"…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of thedecisions without me!"
"Monica";"That doesn't seem fair."
"Rachel";"I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting,poisoning habit!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, it is the best."
"Rachel";"I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outsidesmoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupidclean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who doyou think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?"
"Monica";"Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say youwanna get some fresh air."
"Rachel";"Yeah, I can do that."
"Chandler";"Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?"
"Rachel";"I would love to!"
"Phoebe";"Oh good!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I wanna go to babe."
"Phoebe";"Oh good."
"Phoebe";"Oh wait, I change my mind! (She slams the door on them.) Okay, let'stalk about the party! I have so many ideas! (Holds up a cocktail napkin.)"
"Monica";"Yeah, me too! (Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, look at that."
"Monica";"All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus,umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music,here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go reallygood with the food."
"Phoebe";"What happened to the intimate dinner party?"
"Monica";"Oh, we're not doing that. Okay…"
"Phoebe";"So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot,co-host."
"Monica";"What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty ofthings for you to do!"
"Phoebe";"Like what?"
"Monica";"(Thinks) Cups."
"Phoebe";"Cups? You're giving me cups?"
"Monica";"And ice!"
"Phoebe";"Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? (Thinks ofsomething) All right. Fine, okay, I"
"Monica";"Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant…"
"Phoebe";"I got it! Mine!"
"Ross";"(entering, downtrodden) Hi."
"Monica";"Hey! How'd the audition go?!"
"Ross";"Not so good."
"Monica";"Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's (sadly) "Audition didn't go sowell. (Happily) Yeah it did?""
"Ross";"(Pause) Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!"
"Joey";"(also downtrodden) Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actuallydidn't get a callback."
"Monica";"You got a callback too didn't you?"
"Joey";"(Happily) Yeah I did!"
"Kim";"Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?"
"Rachel";"Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come outhere and get some fresh air."
"Kim";"Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection."
"Rachel";"Oh great!"
"Kim";"So anyway we really… (Someone exhales and Rachel turns and coughs.)Honey, we're just smoking all over you."
"Nancy";"Oh, sorry!"
"Rachel";"Oh that's okay."
"Kim";"No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there. (They walk away.)"
"Nancy";"So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited aboutthe line."
"Kim";"Oh that's great! You are the best!"
"Rachel";"Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Y'knowwhat, actually… (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kimare standing and laughing.) Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?"
"Nancy";"I thought you didn't smoke."
"Rachel";"Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what Imean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys arecrazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time."
"Kim";"We get high."
"Rachel";"Oh, me too."
"Kim";"I'm kidding."
"Rachel";"(Laughs) Oh, me too."
"Ross";"Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?"
"Joey";"Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so…"
"Carol";"Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?"
"Joey";"Who knows?"
"The Casting Director";"(entering) Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond,Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much."
"Ross";"Yes!! I knew it!! (To the people who didn't make it.) Bye-bye! So long!Later!"
"Joey";"Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!"
"Ross";"Yeah!"
"The Casting Director";"Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all havesuch different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be eitheryou two (Points to Joey and Raymond) or you two. (Points to Kyle and Ben.) (Exits.)"
"Joey";"Man, this is gonna be kinda weird."
"Ross";"Yeah, it is."
"Ross";"No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird."
"Phoebe";"(entering, carrying two garbage bags) Hey!"
"Ross and Chandler";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?"
"Chandler";"Ah sure. What's in 'em?"
"Phoebe";"Umm, cups."
"Chandler";"Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water."
"Ross";"Seriously that's a lot of cups."
"Phoebe";"Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, andMonica is gonna"
"Chandler";"Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done."
"Phoebe";"Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. (She goes and opens thedoor to Joey.) Oh, hi Joey!"
"Joey";"Hey Pheebs! (To the guys) Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something."
"Ross";"What's up?"
"Joey";"Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know megoing up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, Ithink I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition."
"Ross";"Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man."
"Joey";"That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my careerwe're talking about here!"
"Ross";"Well, you just…"
"Joey";"I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyoneshould step aside it should be Ben!"
"Ross";"What?!"
"Joey";"What? Chandler! Tell 'em!"
"Chandler";"(shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens thedoor.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)"
"Ross";"Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-youjust tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad."
"Joey";"At least I care about his feelings!"
"Ross";"What?!"
"Joey";"Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?"
"Ross";"And why wouldn't he get it?"
"Joey";"Oh, come on! Have you"
"Ross";"Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?"
"Joey";"You just give him a spoon baby!"
"Ross";"Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!"
"Joey";"Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!"
"Ross";"You're kid's name is Raymond!"
"Joey";"Yeah?! So's yours!"
"Monica";"(To Rachel) How did work go?"
"Rachel";"Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said,y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions."
"Monica";"You stink!"
"Rachel";"Thanks!"
"Monica";"No, I'm-I'm serious!"
"Rachel";"Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking.This is actually the smell of success."
"Chandler";"Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!"
"Rachel";"I did not!"
"Chandler";"Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!"
"Rachel";"All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!"
"Chandler";"I wish I had smoked for my career…"
"Monica";"That's so gross!"
"Rachel";"No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels alittle fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up."
"Chandler";"Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!"
"Monica";"Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'mnot kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)"
"Chandler";"I think you smell great! (He sniffs her shoulder.)"
"Kim";"So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?"
"Nancy";"Absolutely!"
"Rachel";"I am so on board! (She throws away her recently lit cigarette.)"
"Kim";"Rachel didn't you just light that?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back,y'know? (Laughs) Good luck, Rach."
"Nancy";"I've actually been thinking about quitting lately."
"Kim";"Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but everyMonday morning it's like (Mimics chain smoking.)"
"Nancy";"Tell me about it!"
"Rachel";"Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!"
"Kim";"It does sound appealing."
"Nancy";"Oh, I never could do it."
"Rachel";"Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! Wecan get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!"
"Kim";"Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!"
"Rachel";"Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! (She grabs theircigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)"
"Kim";"My late husband gave me that lighter. (Rachel laughs.) I'm not kidding."
"Rachel";"Okay then! (She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kim'slighter.)"

"Rachel";"(hearing that) Oh man!"
"Phoebe";"(To Chandler) Check it out! Cup hat! (Points to her hat.) Cup banner!Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! (Holds up one.)"
"Chandler";"Great job with the cups, Pheebs!"
"Monica";"(overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her!"
"Phoebe";"(following him) And did you notice the ice? (Gestures to 3 huge bucketsof ice on the table.) Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! (Pourssome water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.) Ahhh! Mystical!"
"Chandler";"Awesome!"
"Monica";"Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they'reall filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!"
"Chandler";"There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!"
"Monica";"Y'know…go! Go! Right there! (Points)"

"Rachel";"Oh, okay, not so weird."

"Ross";"Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well."
"Joey";"Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)"
"Ross";"No really, I-I am! I feel bad!"
"Joey";"Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck.I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup." (Nods his headin disgust.)"
"Ross";"Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because yousuck, maybe you messed up because you care"
"Joey";"What you do mean?"
"Ross";"I think, sub-consciously…"
"Joey";"Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me."
"Ross";"(pause) I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so thatBen would get the part."
"Joey";"Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah.Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor…"
"Ross";"No!"
"Joey";"No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it wasmore important to see him succeed."
"Ross";"There you go. Thank you!"
"Joey";"Thank you! So, did-did he get it?"
"Ross";"No."
"Joey";"Eh, what are you gonna do?"
"Chandler";"(to Kim and Nancy) Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I wassupposed to meet her for lunch."
"Kim";"Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten."
"Chandler";"Okay, great."
"Kim";"(to Nancy) So we talked about the (Chandler sneaks closer to her cigarette)whole presentation yesterday at lunch (Closer) and he wondered if one person would beenough (Closer) to get a take on the trip (Still closer) and I said, "Yeah,absolutely!" (She's interrupted by Chandler who has reached his goal and takes a dragfrom her cancer stick.)"
"Chandler";"I'll catch you guys later. (Exits.)"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?"
"Chandler";"Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've gotreservations at Ja George."
"Ross";"Wow! How'd you get in there?"
"Chandler";"Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert."
"Delivery Girl";"Hi Chandler!"
"Chandler";"Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut."
"Caitlin";"Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy."
"Chandler";"Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a"
"Caitlin";"It's uh, 27 dollars even."
"Chandler";"Oh, okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go."
"Caitlin";"Hey, where's the chicken?"

"Caitlin";"(laughs) Great. I'll see you later!"
"Chandler";"Okay, bye!"
"Ross";"What the hell was that?!"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Ross";"The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm,let's say my sister?!"
"Chandler";"I was not flirting."
"Ross";"It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut (Makes some whiney,nasally noises.)""
"Chandler";"Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was notflirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all."
"Ross";"Yeah, right."
"Chandler";"You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to movetowards Ross.)"
"Ross";"(backing away) I'm good."
"Rachel";"I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on"
"Phoebe";"I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?"
"Rachel";"No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him."
"Phoebe";"Don't get me started on that."
"Chandler";"I was not flirting."
"Ross";"And on your anniversary, for shame!"
"Rachel";"What's going on?"
"Ross";"Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!"
"Chandler";"I was not and oh God, shh!"
"Ross";"Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hittingon her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it."
"Phoebe";"Sounds like somebody wants to be"
"Ross";"Well…"
"Chandler";"Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?"
"Rachel";"Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been"
"Ross";"Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place."
"Rachel";"Hm-mmm."

"Rachel";"Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements."
"Phoebe";"(looking through the pizzas) Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okayRoss, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!"
"Ross";"This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and whenshe does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat."
"Phoebe";"See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone."
"Joey";"(entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! Youremember my grandmother!"
"Rachel";"Big night!"
"Phoebe";"This is so cool!"
"Chandler";"So, Joey on"
"Joey";"Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English."
"Chandler";"I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She juststares at him.) I've done it again."
"Joey";"She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that'sbelieved in me."
"Joey";"Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so…"
"Monica";"(entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!"

"Monica";"So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night inLondon…"
"Chandler";"Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)"
"Monica";"Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?"
"Chandler";"The one that doesn't."
"Monica";"That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready."
"Chandler";"Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?"

"Rachel";"(She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!"
"Phoebe";"Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?"
"Rachel";"Oh what, you-you want both of them?"

"Monica";"Chandler, this actually bothers you?"
"Chandler";"Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people.Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with otherwomen?"
"Rachel";"Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women."
"Ross";"And thank you, for that."
"Rachel";"But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was neververy good at the flirting thing."
"Ross";"What? (Mumbles) What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you."
"Rachel";"Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then"

"Monica";"No way!"
"Chandler";"It's true."
"Monica";"Well that's pathetic!"
"Chandler";"Again true."
"Monica";"And this goes for all guys?"
"Chandler";"All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guysfrom the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way."
"Joey";"(To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I stillhaven't told her!"

"Ross";"What do you mean?"
"Rachel";"Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.(Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)"
"Ross";"And she just gave you this?"

"Rachel";"Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fixyou a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?"
"Ross";"Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!"
"Rachel";"No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, youget all the margarita stuff ready."
"Monica";"All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need somecash."
"Rachel";"Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?"
"Monica";"Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around…"
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Monica";"What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!"
"Ross";"(to Gary) That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy."
"Chandler";"It is starting to get dark out there."
"Ross";"(to Gary) He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!"
"Gary";"Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative."
"Chandler";"(laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime."

"Gary";"It's called the cherry."
"Ross";"It's the—Chandler!!"

"Joey";"Yep!"
"Gary";"Yeah, you can't eat that in my car."
"Joey";"(dejected) Yeah okay. (To Chandler) Even though my tax dollars paid forthis car."
"Joey";"Yeah, okay."
"Chandler";"(leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwichreally does smell good."
"Joey";"Did I say you could smell it?!"
"Chandler";"I can't smell your sandwich?"
"Joey";"Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!"
"Chandler";"Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joeyjust glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?"
"Joey";"Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Joey";"Are you thinking about Monica?"
"Chandler";"Yeah."
"Joey";"Yeah, what's that like?"
"Rachel";"Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please!Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! (She picks up the 2 pieces and looks at thestand.) Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it andfinds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phonerings.)"
"Monica";"(on the answering machine) Rach! It's me! Pick up!"
"Rachel";"Hey! What's up?!"
"Monica";"I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt,some margarita mix, and tequila."
"Rachel";"So all we have is ice?"
"Monica";"See if he has ice."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Emily";"(on answering machine) Hello Ross? It's Emily. (Rachel runs back into theroom with the tequila.) I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting marriedtomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made amistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if youare, call me tonight. Okay, bye."
"Rachel";"Oh. Oh! (Takes a slug of tequila.)"
"Ross";"So where are we going next?"
"Gary";"This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprisehim coming home."
"Chandler";"Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?"
"Joey";"Come on man! (To Gary) Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoesa little bit before he lawyers up?"
"Gary";"It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!"
"Ross";"Yeah, no one talks like that!"
"Joey";"Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!"
"Ross";"Hey, I'm more cop than you two!"
"Chandler";"How do you figure that?"
"Ross";"Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!"
"Chandler";"Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay."
"Ross";"Umm, jealous! (He drops the cherry and it turns on.)"
"Gary";"Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here."
"Ross";"Yeah, no problem. (Tries to turn it off.)"
"Gary";"Ross!"
"Ross";"Sorry! Sorry! Oh, (He sticks it under his shirt) there! (It's just thereflashing through his shirt) Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!"
"Chandler";"Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors."
"Joey";"Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?"
"Emily";"(on answering machine) Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not,but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye."
"Monica";"(does Rachel's) Nooo!"
"Rachel";"(does Monica's) I know!"
"Monica";"Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!"
"Rachel";"What?! We can't do that!"
"Monica";"We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her backand then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling,neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?"
"Rachel";"Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I knowthat! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the rightto erase his message!"
"Monica";"I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Comeon! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?"
"Rachel";"I don't think he's the one who needs help."
"Monica";"No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking aboutrunning out on her wedding day. (Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing whatshe just said.) Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What'she gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! Imean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) Okay, fine,all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the samepeople."
"Rachel";"Ugh!"
"Monica";"Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying toplay on him."
"Rachel";"Okay,"
"Answering Machine";"Your messages have been erased."
"Rachel";"Noooooooo!"
"Chandler";"Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can"
"Gary";"No. But that reminds me, (handing back a clipboard) sign this."
"Ross";"What is it?"
"Gary";"Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrapyour knee or y'know, get your head blown off."
"Chandler";"(deadpan) Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that."
"Gary";"Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!"
"Ross";"What? What? What? What is it?"
"Joey";"Is everything okay?"
"Chandler";"What's going on?"
"Gary";"Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him."
"Gary";"Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. (Joey slowly moves off ofRoss.) Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?"
"Joey";"(To Ross) You okay man?"
"Ross";"Uh-huh. Thank Joey!"
"Chandler";"Uh,"
"Joey";"Hi."
"Monica";"All right, I guess we should go."
"Rachel";"No, wait. Wait."
"Monica";"Oh yeah right! (She grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.)"
"Rachel";"No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!"
"Monica";"There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!"
"Rachel";"Yeah well unless we tell him."
"Monica";"Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue withyou! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part ofit."
"Rachel";"Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message."
"Ross";"(on the machine) Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember thisfeeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay?Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! (He hangs up.)"
"Monica";"Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!"
"Rachel";"Right?"
"Gary";"Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?"
"Phoebe";"(excited) John Glenn is here?!"
"Gary";"No, Joey!"
"Ross";"Pheebs, we had the most"
"Gary";"Wait! Hold on! (He goes over to Phoebe and gives her a kiss.) (To Phoebe)Hi!"
"Phoebe";"Hi!"
"Gary";"(To Ross) Okay, go ahead."
"Ross";"Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And"
"Phoebe";"My God, Joey!"
"Chandler";"(pouting) It was a car backfire!"
"Ross";"Yeah, but-but"
"Joey";"Yeah, I didn't know that."
"Ross";"And it could've just as easily have been a bullet."
"Gary";"Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy likeyou."
"Chandler";"Who jumps at loud noises!"
"Ross";"Wow! I could've died tonight."
"Chandler";"Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I thinkI'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets upand starts for the door.)"
"Ross";"I"
"Chandler";"(returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)"
"Gary";"(To Phoebe) So you wanna get some dinner?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah! Sure! Yep! (Gets up) Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now,I'd throw my body on you."
"Gary";"Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a badneighborhood."
"Phoebe";"Okay!"
"Gary";"All right."
"Phoebe";"Bye!"
"Ross and Joey";"Bye!"
"Joey";"Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in thesame day!"
"Joey";"Dude! How come you took off?"
"Chandler";"Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…"
"Joey";"Is something wrong?"
"Chandler";"No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk."
"Joey";"Okay."
"Chandler";"You dove in front of Ross! Ross!"
"Joey";"That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!"
"Chandler";"I do not hate Ross!"
"Joey";"Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You wantRoss out of the picture."
"Chandler";"What picture?"
"Joey";"I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!"
"Chandler";"Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, buty'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!"
"Joey";"Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No!I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He'snot street like us!"
"Chandler";"When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before youwould for me. That's the bottom line."
"Joey";"Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross.Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich."
"Chandler";"From a bullet!"
"Joey";"I know it doesn't make much sense…"
"Joey";"Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!"
"Chandler";"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!"
"Joey";"I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up thesandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!"
"Chandler";"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me."
"Joey";"No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!"
"Chandler";"Really?!"
"Joey";"Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (He unwraps the sandwichand holds it out for Chandler) here."
"Chandler";"Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.)"
"Joey";"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!"
"Joey";"How good is that?"
"Chandler";"(with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho, yeah!"
"Joey";"See?"
"Chandler";"Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.)"
"Joey";"Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!"
"Chandler";"I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me."
"Joey";"Yeah. With a bite! (Takes back the sandwich.) Gee-e-e-eez!"
"Rachel";"Hey! Hi!"
"Ross";"Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?"
"Rachel";"Hey! Y'know what?"
"Ross";"Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here.You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! (He goes over and hugs her.)"
"Rachel";"Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?"
"Ross";"The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I hadan actual near death experience!"
"Rachel";"What?! What? What happened?!"
"Ross";"Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?"
"Rachel";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"And somebody took a shot at me!"
"Rachel";"(gasps) Really?!"
"Ross";"No, a car backfired, but (Rachel suddenly calms down) I thought somebodywas taking a shot at me. And Rach, I…I survived! And I was filled with this-thisgreat respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize everyopportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now."
"Rachel";"Because a car backfired?"
"Ross";"(stares at her briefly) Okay, why are you here?"
"Rachel";"Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing"thing but um, Emily called you today."
"Ross";"You talked to her?"
"Rachel";"No, she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) Butit-it kinda got erased. There's just (Pause) something wrong with your machine."
"Ross";"Well, okay, what-what did she say?"
"Rachel";"Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding anddid you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her."
"Ross";"Wow!"
"Rachel";"Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?"
"Ross";"Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!"
"Rachel";"Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. Becausey'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. Yourdecision. Okay? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) Your decision."
"Ross";"Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily."
"Rachel";"Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right,no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you"
"Ross";"Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but myex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got tomean something!"
"Rachel";"Ugh, Ross! That was"
"Ross";"You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed toseize! Y'know?"
"Rachel";"Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this isabout escaping stuff."
"Ross";"Huh."
"Rachel";"I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death,y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to"
"Ross";"That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-Ireally don't wanna see or talk to her."
"Rachel";"Well, there you go!"
"Ross";"Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day."
"Rachel";"(laughing) Close call day."
"Ross";"Hey, thanks Rach. (They hug.)"
"Rachel";"Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. (Gets up.)"
"Ross";"Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it."
"Rachel";"Oh?"
"Ross";"(on machine) "Hey Ross, it's you!" (Hits the stop button) Ohyeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that."
"Rachel";"No. (She heads for the door again.)"
"Ross";"(looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm, was-was Monicahere?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Yeah, I want my money back."
"Rachel";"(going out the door) Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps,right?"
"Ross";"Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?"
"Phoebe";"Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really agood story."
"Ross";"I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-butheavy fire, like I was in a war or something."
"Monica";"Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a"
"Chandler";"Before or after you were shot by your own troops?"
"Ross";"I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting allof us."
"Chandler";"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches."
"Joey";"Yeah, hero sandwiches. (Points at Ross who points back.)"
"Phoebe";"Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war inany way. (Gets up) But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy youall. (Starts to leave.) (To Joey) Not you Joey."
"Gary";"(To Phoebe) Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?"
"Phoebe";"I'm fine, thanks."
"Chandler";"(To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?"
"Monica";"No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna getsome tea."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Chandler";"Hiya doin' pumpkin?"
"Phoebe";"Nope. (Chandler nods in agreement.)"
"Monica";"So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?"
"Gary";"I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me."
"Monica";"(shocked) Oh my God!"
"Gary";"What do you, what do you think?"
"Monica";"I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?"
"Gary";"Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?"
"Monica";"I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {"
"Gary";"(To Phoebe) I'll see you after work sweetie. (Kisses her.)"
"Phoebe";"Okay. Bye!"
"Phoebe";"So, what movie should we see?"
"Monica";"(sitting down) Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!"
"Phoebe";"What?! Really?!"
"Monica";"He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but Icouldn't hold it in any longer!"
"Phoebe";"I can't believe this!"
"Chandler";"(terrified) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It'sfast!"
"Monica";"Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!"
"Chandler";"Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)"
"Phoebe";"No, but it"
"Monica";"Ohhhh!"
"Phoebe";"No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!"
"Chandler";"So, what are you gonna do?"
"Phoebe";"I don't know. I'll just handle it—I'll ask you to talk to him!"
"Chandler";"Me?! Why me?"
"Phoebe";"Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make himscared like you! Make him a…man!"
"Chandler";"I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'ma lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be."
"Monica";"That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to hertea.)"
"Chandler";"(To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care ofit. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away henods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)"
"Joey";"Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?"
"Ross";"Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten"

"Ross";"Are you serious?!"
"Joey";"Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to sayanything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it."
"Ross";"Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!"
"Joey";"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks hispants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!"
"Rachel";"(entering) Hey, you guys…"
"Joey";"Hey!"

"Joey and Ross";"No."
"Rachel";"All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonnalike it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since Iwas a little girl."
"Ross";"You bought Shawn Cassidy!"
"Rachel";"Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?"
"Joey and Ross";"Yeah!"
"Rachel";"Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Rossstares in shock.) Check it out!"
"Ross";"What-what is it?!"
"Joey";"What the hell is that?!!"
"Rachel";"It's a, it's a cat!"
"Rachel";"Yes it is!"
"Ross";"Why is it inside out?!"
"Rachel";"Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!"

"Ross";"Yeah? How much?"
"Rachel";"A thousand bucks."
"Ross";"ON A CAT??!!!!"
"Joey";"It's not a cat!"
"Rachel";"All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was alittle girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lapand purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!"
"Ross";"Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a littlepolitical here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are"
"Joey";"It's not a cat!"
"Rachel";"Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't carewhat you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They bothglare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!"
"Ross";"(To Joey) Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see howlong we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?"
"Joey";"Uhh, the ball thing."
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Joey";"Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours withoutdropping it?!"
"Ross";"Uhh,"
"Joey";"Okay!"
"Joey";"(catches the ball) Uh-oh."
"Ross";"What?"
"Joey";"I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!"
"Joey";"Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!"
"Ross";"I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Don't switch hands, okay?"
"Chandler";"Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)"
"Gary";"Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?"
"Chandler";"Gary, I'm here to report a crime."
"Gary";"Yeah?"
"Chandler";"It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together."
"Gary";"(laughs, then suddenly serious) What's up?"
"Chandler";"Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in withyou and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me."
"Gary";"Sure. Okay."
"Chandler";"Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you twoare gonna be y'know, live-living together!"
"Gary";"Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy."
"Chandler";"You mean scared."
"Gary";"No, I mean happy."
"Chandler";"Scared? Happy?"
"Gary";"Chandler, what-what are you doing?"
"Chandler";"I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you livedwith Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go tobed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!"
"Gary";"I know! I can't wait!"
"Chandler";"Were you're parents happy, or something?"
"Gary";"Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to findsomeone that I really love. I just—I wanna be around her as much as I can."
"Chandler";"Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary."
"Gary";"So you know what I'm talking about, right?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move inwith her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!"
"Gary";"No, it's too soon for you guys."
"Chandler";"(pause) Yeah, you're right about that."
"Ross";"…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon theydiscovered what"
"Joey";"Maybe this should be more of a quiet game."
"Monica";"(entering) Hey guys!"
"Joey";"Hi!"
"Monica";"Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter)It was right here, where is it?"
"Joey";"I don't know."
"Monica";"All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!"
"Ross";"How do you know? You don't have a watch."
"Monica";"Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute andjust help me find it!"
"Joey";"Oh, I don't know…. Yeah, can't do it."
"Monica";"What?!"
"Ross";"Monica, whatever you do, do"
"Joey";"Yeah, we haven't dropped it in… (Looks to Ross.)"
"Ross";"2 hours, 27 minutes."
"Monica";"Really?!"
"Monica";"(on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it intowork today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch itway over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sickagain) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs upand keeps throwing the ball.)"
"Ross";"Hey Rach!"
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Ross";"Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!"
"Rachel";"Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time."
"Monica";"Rach?"
"Rachel";"Yeah?"
"Monica";"You have scratches all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms arecovered with scratches.)"
"Rachel";"Well, it's my cat."
"Monica";"(shocked) What?!"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah, I got a cat."
"Monica";"I don't want a cat!"
"Joey";"Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat."
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"You guys this cat is"
"Ross";"Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat."
"Monica";"(To Rachel) What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me300!!"
"Rachel";"Well, I was gonna let you play with it."
"Chandler";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?"
"Chandler";"Yes I did, and I think you should do it."
"Phoebe";"What?!"
"Chandler";"He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very luckylady."
"Phoebe";"You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the"
"Chandler";"I’m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him."
"Phoebe";"Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out ofhere, good for nothing."
"Gary";"Hey Chandler."
"Chandler";"Hey Gar!"
"Gary";"(To Phoebe) Hi sweetie. (Kisses her.) Hi, can I talk to you for a second?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah! Okay. (They move to the couch.)"
"Gary";"You look very pretty today."
"Phoebe";"Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.)"
"Gary";"Here's the thing."
"Phoebe";"Yeah?"
"Gary";"Y'know I"
"Phoebe";"Uh-hmm."
"Gary";"Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards."
"Phoebe";"No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just stayingstill. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.)"
"Gary";"Phoebe?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah?"
"Gary";"I want you to move in with me."
"Phoebe";"That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I meanthere's so much we don't know about each other."
"Gary";"(disappointed) Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it."
"Phoebe";"I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for."
"Gary";"(disappointed more) Uh-huh."
"Phoebe";"I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worriedit's gonna be a big mistake."
"Gary";"(on the verge of tears) Yeah."
"Phoebe";"Which is why my answer is yes!"
"Gary";"(suddenly happy) Really?!"
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh! (They hug.) I'm so…happy. (She's not happy.)"
"Ross";"(catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the sameteam!"
"Chandler";"Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?"
"Joey";"That's right baby."
"Chandler";"All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in thegame.)"
"Monica";"(jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Monica";"He's a dropper!"
"Joey";"Oh yeah, that's right!"
"Chandler";"I'm not a dropper!"
"Ross";"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?"
"Chandler";"It's throwing and catching!"
"Ross";"All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)"
"Chandler";"Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses controland almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)"
"Joey";"Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!"
"Monica";"Oh my—Oh good God!"
"Rachel";"(she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys, Idon't know what I'm going to do with this thing!"
"Ross";"Baking it didn't help, huh?"
"Monica";"So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?"
"Rachel";"I tried! They won't take her back."
"Chandler";"Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ."
"Monica";"Rach, why won't they take it back?"
"Rachel";"Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean,what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?"
"Monica";"Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out whatto do with it."
"Rachel";"No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm allscratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)"
"Monica";"Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! Myvision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay.It's okay. Man, that was close."
"Chandler";"Yeah, you almost overreacted to something."
"Phoebe and Gary";"(entering) Hey!"
"All";"Hey!"
"Gary";"We have"
"Phoebe";"We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!"
"All";"Congratulations! Congrats!"

"Phoebe";"Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!"
"Gary";"All right."
"Monica";"So you're moving in with him. What happened?"
"Phoebe";"I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I"
"Monica";"Why, do you write him a lot?"
"Phoebe";"No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost ofstamps. Don't they?"
"All";"Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out."
"Gary";"Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in BrooklynHeights?"
"Phoebe";"No, nothing."
"Gary";"Oh really?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Gary";"Nothing at all?"
"Phoebe";"No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn'thave a pool, I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)"
"Gary";"Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?"
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh!"
"Gary";"Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right? (Closes the door and takesoff his coat.)"

"Phoebe";"Umm, yeah! Today's."
"Gary";"'Cause uh, this is today's"
"Phoebe";"(looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were justbragging!"
"Gary";"Let me tell you what I think might be going on. (Phoebe looks down inshame.) No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. (Points to his eyes and she doesso) Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said,"Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone.Does that sound at all possible to you?"
"Phoebe";"Yes. Yes! Fine! I"
"Gary";"Phoebe…"
"Phoebe";"Yeah?"
"Gary";"Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it"
"Phoebe";"That's so sweet."
"Gary";"Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine!We don't have to move in together. I just—I want you to be happy"
"Phoebe";"Living with you would make me happy."
"Gary";"Phoebe, you"
"Phoebe";"No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!"
"Gary";"Are you sure?"
"Phoebe";"Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!(Hugs him.)"
"Gary";"Oh that's great!"
"Phoebe";"Oh wait, one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind theglass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of theserooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!"
"Rachel";"Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.)"
"Woman No. 1";"(looks into the box) Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!"
"Rachel";"It's not a baby! It's a cat!"
"Woman No. 1";"Eew! It's creepy looking!"
"Rachel";"Oh no! No! It's actually—it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look!(Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah, do you want it?"
"Woman No. 1";"(laughs) No, I hate cats."
"Rachel";"Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! Allright? Move on!"
"Woman No. 2";"Wow! What an unusual cat!"
"Rachel";"Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?"
"Woman No. 2";"Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to goto the shelter (Good for her) but… Okay, why not?"
"Rachel";"Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000."
"Woman No. 2";"What?!"
"Rachel";"Okay, a thousand."
"Woman No. 2";"I thought you wanted to adopt your cat."
"Rachel";"Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as moreof an investment than a cat."
"Woman No. 2";"Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat. (Starts to leave.)"
"Rachel";"(makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously youknow how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't callthe cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leavethe money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled)Damnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?!

"Phoebe";"Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright."
"Joey";"Oh hey, here Pheebs. (He throws her the ball.)"

"Joey";"I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask youquestions and you answer real quick. Okay?"
"Ross";"Okay."
"Joey";"What do you like better action or comedy?"
"Ross";"Action."
"Joey";"Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?"
"Ross";"Dude, you are sick."
"Joey";"Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! What does"
"Monica";"(looks at it more closely) Oh that's an eye removal machine."
"Rachel";"All right, I'm outta here!"
"Monica";"I'm kidding! I'm kidding!"
"The Doctor";"Hi Rachel!"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"The Doctor";"I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don'tworry everything's gonna be just fine."
"Rachel";"So were done then!"
"Dr. Miller";"Almost! But first, we gotta start."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Dr. Miller";"This is a glaucoma test."
"Rachel";"Uh-huh."
"Dr. Miller";"Sit down."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Dr. Miller";"But your chin here. (She does so.) Now, you'll feel a small puff ofair in each eye."
"Rachel";"(jerks back from the tester) What?!"
"Monica";"A small puff of air, now come on!"
"Dr. Miller";"Here we go."
"Rachel";"All right."
"Dr. Miller";"1…2…3! (Rachel jerks back on 3.)"
"Rachel";"I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. (Puts her headback.) Okay."
"Dr. Miller";"Ready?"
"Rachel";"Uh-huh."
"Dr. Miller";"1…2… (She flinches on 2 this time.)"
"Monica";"Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Dr. Miller";"That's okay."
"Monica";"Okay. (Monica backs off.)"
"Rachel";"Okay. Okay!"
"Dr. Miller";"1…2! (She flinches again.) (Gives up.) Y'know what? You'reyoung; you probably don't have glaucoma."
"Rachel";"(really excited) Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow!Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look atpeople's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her toflinch and scream at him.)"
"Dr. Miller";"Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I wantyou to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new."
"Rachel";"Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye."
"Dr. Miller";"Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months."
"Rachel";"Great!"
"Dr. Miller";"And I'll fit you for a glass eye."
"Rachel";"Okay, just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)"
"Monica";"Dr. Miller? (She covers her right eye and reads from the chart) P E C FD."
"Dr. Miller";"Very good Monica! You know where they are."
"Monica";"I sure do! (She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.)(To Rachel) And you don't get one!"
"Rachel";"Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a100% better."
"Monica";"They're still in my coat."
"Rachel";"Damn!"
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey! You ready to go?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat orwill all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Monica";"I love you."
"Joey";"Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!"
"Phoebe";"Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!"
"Chandler";"Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a bighotel suite?"
"Joey";"Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have areal big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room."
"Chandler";"I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a bighotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?"
"Joey";"Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes rightin Joey's pocket."
"Chandler";"So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?"
"Joey";"Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for tenyears." I'm gonna be a millionaire!"
"Ross";"(entering) Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey!"

"Chandler";"Okay!"
"Joey";"Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?"
"Rachel";"Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind thepuss."
"Joey";"See ya! (Walks out.)"
"Rachel";"Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! (Runsafter him.)"
"Ross";"Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? (Phoebe ignores him) Pheebs? (Turns away)Hello? (He sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) Phoebe? (He moves closer andshe keeps moving away.) Phoe-Phoebe! (They end up hanging over the arm rest.) Come on! (Hegrabs the magazine away from her.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there."
"Ross";"Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please,tell me what it is I did!"
"Phoebe";"Well, if you don't know I can't help you."
"Ross";"Well, I don't know."
"Phoebe";"Well, I can't help you."
"Ross";"Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?"
"Phoebe";"Apology accepted."
"Ross";"Okay. So we're, we're good?"

"Phoebe";"I don't know! I don't remember!"
"Ross";"Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?"
"Phoebe";"Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fatass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney."
"Joey";"Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon."
"Chandler";"We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the roadonce."
"Joey";"Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quicklylooks at the road.) I think I just need lunch."
"Chandler";"Yeah."
"Joey";"You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!"
"Chandler";"Isn't that Ross's money?"
"Joey";"Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?"
"Chandler";"I don't know."
"Joey";"Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you abunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mindClear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!"
"Chandler";"Okay!"
"Joey";"Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?"
"Chandler";"Too dry."
"Joey";"Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?"
"Chandler";"No!"
"Joey";"Is this movie gonna be my big break?"
"Chandler";"No!"
"Joey";"(shocked) What?!"
"Chandler";"Yes."
"Joey";"Dude you said, "No!""
"Chandler";"I also said, "Yes!""
"Joey";"You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?"
"Chandler";"No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!"
"Joey";"I don't believe this!"
"Chandler";"Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high."
"Joey";"What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!"
"Chandler";"They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!"
"Joey";"Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping allover my big break."
"Chandler";"Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break."
"Joey";"Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause ifit is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone."
"Chandler";"Oh, you don't want me on the trip?"
"Joey";"Not if you're gonna be like this!"
"Chandler";"All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question likethat I'll lie."
"Joey";"Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!"
"Chandler";"All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out rightnow!"
"Joey";"Fine! (He slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the soundof numerous car horns.) Get out!"
"Chandler";"You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge."
"Joey";"Get out!!"
"Chandler";"All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's nosidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here."
"Ross";"Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?"
"Phoebe";"No."
"Ross";"Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?"
"Phoebe";"No that made me feel precious."
"Monica";"Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar?Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!"
"Ross";"Yeah? Sometimes it's… (Does the fist thing.)"
"Rachel";"Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when hestarts to lose."
"Ross";"Okay,"
"Rachel";"Eh! Stop it!"
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey!"
"Monica";"Chandler! What are you doing here?"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!"
"All";"Why?!"
"Chandler";"I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game whereyou-you ask a question and you answer it really fast."
"Phoebe";"That game should not be played without my supervision."
"Chandler";"Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was thatuh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to doanything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, heshould've pushed me off of the bridge."
"Phoebe";"What's in the bag?"
"Chandler";"Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some giftsthat I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear withone leg?"
"Phoebe";"I do!"
"Rachel";"Okay. (She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The onlyproblem is, it's not over her eye.)"
"Monica";"Not even close."
"Rachel";"Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!"
"Monica";"Okay! All right! Let's do it!"
"Rachel";"All right!"
"Monica";"Sit down. (They sit down on the couch.)"
"Rachel";"All right."
"Monica";"Put your head back."
"Rachel";"Yes!"
"Monica";"All right."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Monica";"Now, open your eyes."
"Rachel";"Okay, they are. (No they're not.)"
"Monica";"How many fingers am I holding up? (She's not holding any up.)"
"Rachel";"(thinks) Four."
"Monica";"Oh my God, I was thinking four."
"Rachel";"Really?!"
"Monica";"Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run?Okay?"
"Rachel";"Okay!"
"Monica";"No drops!"
"Rachel";"Great!"
"Monica";"Okay."

"Rachel";"Well, well, you said it was practice!"
"Monica";"Then why did you move?!"
"Rachel";"Because I knew you were lying!"
"Monica";"All right, come here! (She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch byher legs.)"
"Rachel";"(as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God!Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)"
"Monica";"I am going… I'm going--Turn it over! (Rachel rolled onto herstomach and Monica rolls her back.) I'm… I am going to get these drops in your eyes.(She is holding Rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.)"

"Rachel";"Monica! Stop it!"
"Monica";"(spitting out the eyedropper) Damn! It's empty!"
"Rachel";"Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make afortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqu� pose,at least for primetime TV.)"

"Joey";"(on a pay phone holding a box) Not as upset as he's gonna be when he findsout what I did with his sweater vests!"
"Monica";"What did you do to his sweater vests?"
"Joey";"Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monicalisten is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car."
"Monica";"Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. (She hands the phone to Phoebe.)"

"Chandler";"Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to himif he won't even talk to me?"
"Monica";"Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to LasVegas he'll know that you're sorry."
"Chandler";"That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket ofporn…"
"Phoebe";"No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!"

"Rachel";"No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time."
"Phoebe";"Naked alone time."
"Rachel";"No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk aroundnaked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked."
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?"
"Phoebe";"So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip toLondon?"

"Chandler";"What-what Richard thing?"
"Phoebe";"Oh no. [The patented version.]"
"Chandler";"What Richard thing?"
"Phoebe";"(To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!"
"Monica";"Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted togo for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get madand I didn't want to spoil our anniversary."
"Chandler";"(talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad."
"Monica";"Really?!"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite!It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)"
"Monica";"Great!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, London 1…"

"Ross";"Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-yournakedness?"
"Rachel";"(gasps) Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!"

"Rachel";"Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot."
"Ross";"And we didn’t have sex."
"Rachel";"Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t doanything stupid."

"Phoebe";"Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?"
"Joey";"Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight?"
"Phoebe";"What about my cab?"
"Joey";"I don’t need that anymore."
"Phoebe";"No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back."
"Joey";"I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely.(Gets an idea.) Oh—ooh! How about you come with me?"

"Chandler";"Listen, I gotta talk to you."
"Joey";"Sure! What’s up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with ahuge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him aspoonful.)"
"Chandler";"Monica and I almost got married last night."
"Joey";"Oh my God! That’s huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come Iwasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say,"Ross." Do"
"Chandler";"Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get marriedyet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming outof that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast.Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?"
"Joey";"Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material."
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Joey";"Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anythinglike me, she’s just gonna be relieved."
"Monica";"How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna breakhis heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore."
"Phoebe";"Well you don’t."
"Monica";"Yes I do!"
"Phoebe";"Good! Good! I was just testing you."
"Chandler";"(returning with Joey) Hi."
"Monica";"Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon."
"Phoebe";"No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable."
"Ross";"Hey!"
"The Girls";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Ross";"What?"
"Chandler";"Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…"
"Rachel";"(To Ross) I don’t know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night?Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night."
"Ross";"Yeah!"
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch."
"Monica";"Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!"
"Rachel";"(gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)"

"Rachel";"Oh my God."
"Ross";"I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!"
"Rachel";"No!"
"Joey";"They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who getmarried in Vegas"
"Phoebe";"Hell, I’m drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? Ican’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!"
"Monica";"What are you guys gonna do?"
"Rachel";"Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)"
"Chandler";"Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’sfree, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free."
"Ross";"Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to getdivorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment."
"Joey";"An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here."
"Phoebe";"Oh-oh, that’s your thing."
"Ross";"What?"
"Phoebe";"You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guywho gets divorced."
"Ross";"No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love gettingdivorced!"
"Phoebe";"Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so muchyou’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonnahave to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I’m so drunk."
"Monica";"So, what do"
"Chandler";"I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!"
"Monica";"I know I love you! (They hug.)"
"Chandler";"So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they haveall the marriages thing? I love you."
"Monica";"That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dicedecide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!"
"Chandler";"Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, sosay uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there’s a"
"Monica";"All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 wedon’t get married."
"Chandler";"Sounds great."
"Monica";"Okay. (They approach the craps table.)"
"Croupler";"Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please."
"Monica";"Ready?"
"Chandler";"Ready!"
"Monica";"(sarcastic) Come on eight."
"Chandler";"(deadpan) Yes, yes eight."
"Croupler";"Eight! Easy eight. (She rolls a 3 and a 5 and they’re stunned.)"
"Monica";"Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight."
"Chandler";"That was"
"Monica";"Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hardeight."
"Chandler";"That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!"
"Monica";"I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?"
"Chandler";"Yeah. (They go pack.) We’re doing the right thing, right?"
"Monica";"Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up tofate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be aclear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandlerand Monica standing side-by-side holding each other’s hands.)"
"Phoebe";"Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Comeon Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any (sees that he’s asleep)"
"Joey";"(wakes up) What?!"
"Phoebe";"Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road sixhours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next reststop and"

"Joey";"Really? I don’t…"
"Phoebe";"Sing!!"
"Joey";"(starts singing)"
"Joey";"(to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He openshis eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)"
"Hitchhiker";"(driving) Morning! (Phoebe screams again.)"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey, hubby!"
"Ross";"Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that wholeannulment thing?"
"Rachel";"Uh-huh."
"Ross";"I’m not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)"
"Rachel";"Okay! So, we’ll just stay married."
"Ross";"Yes, exactly!"
"Rachel";"And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!"
"Ross";"Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk youinto this more."
"Rachel";"Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually thinkyou’re kidding."
"Ross";"I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have"
"Rachel";"What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!"
"Ross";"Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill someform out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the boxthat says Mrs.! It’s"
"Rachel";"Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? Weabsolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far"
"Ross";"I’m asking you to do me a favor."
"Rachel";"You are asking me to be your wife!"
"Ross";"And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor."
"Monica";"That kid really kicked me hard on the plane."
"Chandler";"Well you did pull his hair."
"Monica";"He took my snack!"
"Chandler";"I’m not getting into this again!"
"Monica";"Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad."
"Chandler";"Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay.(He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go ofMonica who is only holding on by his neck.)"
"Monica";"This doesn’t mean anything, does it?"
"Chandler";"No!"
"Monica";"Okay."
"Phoebe";"(To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be arape—(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker’s face), a rapist or akiller or something!"
"Joey";"Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!"
"Phoebe";"Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (Tothe hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!"
"Hitchhiker";"No!"
"Phoebe";"Do you like car games?"

"Phoebe";"Oh, okay."
"Hitchhiker";"This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number."
"Phoebe";"And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so theball’s pretty much in your court."
"Hitchhiker";"All right, see ya Pheebs. (Gets out and Phoebe drives away.)"
"Joey";"Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up toyou. Huh? (Starts singing.)"
"Phoebe";"Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’tresist that beautiful voice!"
"Joey";"Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with yourfriend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is animportant part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as Iknow you."

"Chandler";"(entering, slowly) Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpackhere?"
"Monica";"Then all your stuff would be here."
"Chandler";"Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
"Monica";"Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean itdoesn’t make any sense."
"Chandler";"Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’msaying?"
"Monica";"Live together? There have been no signs for that."
"Chandler";"Me asking is kind of a sign."

"Phoebe";"So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’teven know about it?!—Op,"
"Ross";"Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Justdon’t say anything to Rachel, please?"

"Rachel";"Noooooooo!!"
"Chandler";"Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?"
"Monica";"Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?"
"Chandler";"No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict."
"Monica";"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?"
"Chandler";"No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, "Joey, I havetoo…" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "…go to thebathroom." He may think I’m sick."
"Monica";"Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have toget it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them.Okay? That’s it."

"Joey";"Wow! (Tearing up) Well, uh… Hey! I’m really happy for you guys!Congratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door on theverge of tears as Monica stops him.)"
"Monica";"Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!"
"Joey";"Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses,and turns back.) Like you’d believe that. This sucks!"
"Chandler";"Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promiseyou, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!"

"Phoebe";"Guys, I’m happy too."
"Monica";"Okay, come here! (Phoebe joins them in the hug.)"
"Phoebe";"Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled… (Winksat Ross.)"
"Monica";"Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could youplease try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?(Exits.)"
"Ross";"Bye."
"Phoebe";"Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel, what couldthat be?!"
"Ross";"Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is anembarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!"
"Phoebe";"Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced threetimes, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates…"
"Ross";"(interrupting) No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of thedating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy,and-and, Geologists."
"Phoebe";"Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart andsweet and that is"
"Ross";"Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?"
"Phoebe";"Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who havebeen divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-thisembarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here."
"Ross";"What?! Why?"
"Phoebe";"(to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorcedfor the third time, but wouldn’t you date him?"

"Chandler";"Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official,we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?"
"Monica";"No."
"Chandler";"Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave."
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progressat work and then your boss calls you Raquel."
"Chandler";"Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called meSha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously."
"Rachel";"I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so ofcourse no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the endof the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!"
"Chandler";"Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Chandler";"(To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)"
"Monica";"Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and Iare going to live together, here."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys!"
"Monica";"Really?!"
"Rachel";"And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us aregonna have such a good time living together!"
"Monica";"Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correcther.)"
"Rachel";"And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers youtake in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late."
"Chandler";"Rach…"
"Monica";"Yeah, he’s gonna work on that."
"Rachel";"Ohh! This is"
"Monica";"(singing)"
"Ross";"…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage,wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at thealtar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to getmarried when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’sfault."
"Phoebe";"Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Whowouldn’t want to date him?"
"Stephanie";"Well the divorces don’t bother me, I’d date him. But, notwhile he’s still married."
"Phoebe";"Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldn’t you want a date?"
"Karin";"Actually, I’m dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I wasonly dating guys that were like y’know bad for me, so until I work that out…"
"Phoebe";"(interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?"
"Meg";"Well, I don’t care about the divorces either, but I wouldn’t datehim. It’s just that he’s"
"Ross";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"(leaning to him) She said, "He’s obviously still in love withthis Rachel girl." (He glares at her.)"
"Ross";"This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have lovedher in the past, but"
"Phoebe";"Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her."
"Ross";"We were drunk! I would’ve married uh,"
"Phoebe";"Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!"
"Ross";"(to the panel) Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I"
"Phoebe";"Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he"
"Ross";"(getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget aboutthe whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right nowand get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth—(leansdown to Meg’s ear)—Nothing!!"
"Meg";"Okay now I wouldn’t date you because you seem a little creepy."
"Karin";"I am"
"Chandler";"Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?"
"Monica";"Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! Icouldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!"
"Chandler";"Well, Joey’s my best friend."
"Monica";"I’m not your best friend?"
"Chandler";"You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would youplease tell Rachel though?"
"Monica";"All right, all right, at least I’m prepared."
"Chandler";"Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reachesfor one.)"
"Monica";"(slapping his hand) Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey-hey!"
"Monica";"These aren’t for you! Are you upset?"
"Chandler";"I am now!"
"Rachel";"(entering) Hey roomie!"
"Chandler";"Okay, bye! (Exits.)"
"Monica";"Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you."
"Rachel";"(gasps) Are you pregnant?!"
"Monica";"No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a littlemisunderstanding before."
"Rachel";"Um-hmm."
"Monica";"Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, livetogether we meant"
"Rachel";"(laughs) Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I didthat."
"Monica";"Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’mreally sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’sabsolutely no rush."
"Rachel";"Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)"
"Monica";"Okay. Don’t you want a cookie?"
"Rachel";"Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks."
"Monica";"Maybe, do you need a tissue?"
"Rachel";"Monica, where did you get these?!"
"Monica";"I made them!"
"Rachel";"Ooh, good God, they’re so yummy! (She re-ingests the previouslyexpelled cookie matter from the tissue.)"
"Joey";"God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re nothere. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. "You wannago over to Joey and Chandler’s?" "Can’t, its not there.""
"Chandler";"Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all thesame stuff."
"Joey";"Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the nightand have those long talks about our feelings and the future."
"Chandler";"Not once did we do that."
"Monica";"(entering) Hi."
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hi."
"Monica";"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us."
"Chandler";"Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?"
"Monica";"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. Shewasn’t angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)"
"Chandler";"And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friendcry?"
"Monica";"I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that toomuch to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as youguys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I meanwe-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!"
"Joey";"Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of anera! No more J-man and Channie’s!!"
"Chandler";"Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!"
"Russell";"You got married again."
"Ross";"Yes."
"Russell";"So that’s your second marriage in two years."
"Ross";"Yes, second in two years. Third overall."
"Russell";"Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I somuch business from one client. Why don’t you tell me what happened."
"Ross";"Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…"
"Russell";"(interrupting) I’m sorry, is this the same Rachel who’s nameyou said at the altar in the second marriage?"
"Ross";"Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do"
"Russell";"Oh, that’s better then."
"Ross";"This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled."
"Russell";"I see. Have you considered therapy?"
"Ross";"I think just the"
"Russell";"There are a couple of forms to fill out."
"Ross";"Easy."
"Russell";"And we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were notof uh, sound mind."
"Ross";"No problem."
"Russell";"And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge."
"Ross";"Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda allready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of."
"Russell";"Of course you did. Look Ross, you can’t get an annulment unlessyou and Rachel are both there."
"Ross";"Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.)I will think about the therapy."
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up ourstuff."
"Rachel";"Okay!"
"Monica";"Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the"
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Monica";"Hey Rach, what about this? (She holds up a chrome 5-point star.) Huh?Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know,too many memories!"
"Rachel";"(grabbing the star) What the hell is that?"
"Monica";"I don’t know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey,Rachel, you want the big plate? I want"
"Rachel";"Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!"
"Monica";"Something to remember me by!"
"Rachel";"Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know,I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time."
"Monica";"But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!"
"Rachel";"Are you okay? You’re not blinking."
"Monica";"I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end ofera."
"Rachel";"Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’tthink six years counts as an era."
"Monica";"An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it wassignificant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!"
"Rachel";"What is the matter with you?!"
"Monica";"What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?!Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I meanaren’t you gonna miss me at all?!"
"Rachel";"All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s justa little hard to believe."
"Monica";"What’s hard to believe?"
"Rachel";"Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff!Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! Iguess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’msorry."
"Monica";"Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here."
"Rachel";"But I…"
"Monica";"No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that wejust, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. Andit"
"Rachel";"It is? Really?"
"Monica";"Yeah, sweetie."
"Rachel";"(starting to lose her composure) I mean we’re not, we’re notgonna live together anymore?"
"Monica";"No."
"Rachel";"What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.)"
"Monica";"I’m gonna miss you! (They hug.)"
"Rachel";"I mean it’s the end of an era!"
"Monica";"I know!"
"Phoebe";"(to Joey and Chandler) Okay, bye!"
"Ross";"Oh no."
"Phoebe";"So? Did you get the annulment?"
"Ross";"I couldn’t."
"Phoebe";"I knew it! Because you love Rachel."
"Ross";"It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love."
"Ross";"I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right nowabout the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay?Would I do that if I loved her?"
"Phoebe";"I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her."
"Ross";"I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)"
"Ross";"Ohh, what’s wrong?!"
"Rachel";"Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out andeverything is changing."
"Ross";"Oh my—Come here! Come here! (He hugs her.) It’s okay.Everything’s gonna be okay."
"Rachel";"Thank you."
"Ross";"Of course."
"Joey";"So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married,do you think you and I should hook up?"
"Phoebe";"Oh we do, but not just yet."
"Joey";"Really?! Well, when?"
"Phoebe";"Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthyrich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out."
"Joey";"Wow."
"Phoebe";"I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money andyou’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids."
"Joey";"Great!"
"Phoebe";"But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married.We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will beeasy because of Rachel’s drinking problem."
"Joey";"Oh-oh, what about Ross?"
"Phoebe";"I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words andI kill him."
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding hisbreath for almost four minutes!"
"Joey";"(To Chandler) Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!"
"Rachel";"(entering from her room) Pheebs, I wanna ask you something."
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh, what?"
"Rachel";"Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re sobeautiful…"
"Phoebe";"Oh!"
"Rachel";"…how about I move in with you?"
"Phoebe";"Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?"
"Monica";"Who’s Denise?"
"Phoebe";"My roommate."
"Rachel";"You have a roommate?!"
"Phoebe";"Yes, Denise. Denise!"
"Joey";"Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, isshe cute?"
"Chandler";"Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that noneof us know anything about?"
"Phoebe";"Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about herall the time!"
"Joey";"Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra roomover at my place…"
"Rachel";"Oh, that’s true."
"Joey";"Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We couldstay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place."
"Chandler";"Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!"
"Phoebe";"Hey."
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?"
"Ross";"Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well."
"Phoebe";"You didn’t tell her did you?"
"Ross";"No."
"Phoebe";"Of course not, because you’re in love with her."
"Ross";"I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out soI eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset.I-I just comforted her, as a friend."
"Phoebe";"What do you mean, comforted her?"
"Ross";"It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug."
"Phoebe";"Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!"
"Ross";"It’s also a sign of friendship."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out ofRoss’s cookie.)"
"Ross";"(grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?"
"Ross";"S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?"
"Phoebe";"Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of herhead! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in lovewhen they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross, you’re ascientist."
"Ross";"I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got inmy face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty. (Phoeberaises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybeit means I have feelings for coconuts!"
"Phoebe";"(taking his coffee) Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, allright? Rachel’s not in the same place you are."
"Ross";"(grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being inlove, then she"
"Phoebe";"Okay, I didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love!"
"Joey";"Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you."
"Chandler";"Who was it?"
"Joey";"I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message."Jeez! (Exits.)"
"Monica";"Okay listen, y’know when you move in Rachel’s room is gonna beempty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?"
"Chandler";"Sure!"
"Monica";"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? Witha mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we couldhave a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they lovedstaying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much."
"Chandler";"Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe itcould be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like"
"Monica";"No."
"Chandler";"Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interestingidea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely.""
"Monica";"Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talkabout it, but no."
"Chandler";"So, that’s it?"
"Monica";"I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. Thebeautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques."
"Chandler";"Which is why"
"Monica";"What do you have against the beautiful guest room?"
"Chandler";"I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room,especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!"
"Monica";"Are you mocking me?"
"Chandler";"No, I’m not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautifulguest room. (Exits.)"
"Joey";"Hey, what’s up?"
"Chandler";"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight."
"Joey";"But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came outtoday. (Shows him the paper.)"
"Chandler";"(reading the ad) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker,non-ugly." Nice!"
"Joey";"Yeah? I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be aninteresting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? Someone I can learnfrom, someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different thanme; a guy who’s"
"Rachel";"Pheebs, I have to ask you…"
"Phoebe";"Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now."
"Rachel";"You’re just staring into space."
"Phoebe";"Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil. (There’s a pencil lyingon the table.)"
"Rachel";"This one? (Picks it up.)"
"Phoebe";"It worked!"
"Rachel";"Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place Ican afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; (Points to one andstarts to read it.) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It’sjust, there is nothing! The city’s full!"
"Phoebe";"Wait, no, look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) "Two bedroom,two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay…" Oh, yeah, but it’s onthe ground floor."
"Ross";"(entering) Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Ross";"Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?"
"Rachel";"Yeah! Why?"
"Ross";"Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s goingon a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh,you interested?"
"Rachel";"That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I loveWarren! Thank you!"
"Ross";"Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano thaterupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.(Rachel just looks at him.) Here’s Warren’s number."
"Rachel";"Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thankyou!"
"Ross";"Okay, you go grab it!"
"Phoebe";"I saw it."
"Ross";"I don’t know what you’re talking about."
"Phoebe";"Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’tadmit. You love her again; you re-love her!"
"Ross";"Look, I do not re-love her."
"Phoebe";"I can’t believe you won’t just admit it! (Pause) Okay, justpromise me that you won’t do anything stupid."
"Ross";"Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?"
"Rachel";"(returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is alreadysubletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything."
"Ross";"You can live with me."
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"What?!"
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"Oh my God! Are you serious?!"
"Ross";"Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)"
"Rachel";"I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thankyou!"
"Ross";"Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out."
"Phoebe";"Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so,not stupid."
"Rachel";"Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I wasgonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!"
"Ross";"Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right."
"Rachel";"Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisseshim on the cheek and exits.)"
"Ross";"Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) You’re gonna say things now,aren’t ya?"
"Phoebe";"No. No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thinghappened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to herand he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! Andthat’s how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay,that’s a lie."
"Chandler";"Hi."
"Monica";"Hi."
"Chandler";"Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have agame room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t getgirls, and now I"
"Monica";"Stop it Chandler. (Chandler is relieved) I’m sorry too."
"Chandler";"Really?"
"Monica";"Yeah! Oh yes!"
"Chandler";"Ohh."
"Monica";"Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think ofsomething to do with the room together."
"Chandler";"That’s a great idea! We can"
"Monica";"Totally!"
"Chandler";"We don’t have to come up with this now."
"Monica";"Oh good."
"Chandler";"Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we canmake in the living room?"
"Monica";"Changes?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture tomake room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)"
"Monica";"You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger overhere?"
"Chandler";"Is that a problem?"
"Monica";"Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together."
"Chandler";"Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over."
"Monica";"See now-now you’re taking them away from their home."
"Chandler";"Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everythinghere is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!"
"Monica";"Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it,everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Ohcome on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’tmatch! Where is it gonna go?!"
"Chandler";"In the game room!"
"Monica";"Look it is"
"Chandler";"All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring overthe chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambianceover here at Grandma’s place!! (Storms out.)"
"Joey";"(exiting from Chandler’s room with the new roommate) Everything onyour application looks really good—Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and yourfriends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?"
"The Potential Roommate";"Oh don’t worry, I’m not really a party girl."
"Joey";"Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you toreally think about your answers. Okay?"
"Chandler";"(entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potentialroommate) Hi! I’ll be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)"
"Joey";"Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants theapartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it."
"Chandler";"Why did you take the shower curtain down?"
"Joey";"That thing was a hazard! (To the potential roommate) I’m very safetyconscious."
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff."
"Rachel";"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandlerhad a big fight and they’re not moving in."
"Ross";"What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re stillmoving in right?"
"Rachel";"No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room."
"Ross";"What?! Over a stupid room!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched‘cause I don’t have to move in here!"
"Ross";"Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!"
"Ross";"What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over aroom?! I mean, that is so silly!"
"Monica";"Ross, we can handle this."
"Ross";"Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two peopleI care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of thesilliness!"
"Chandler";"Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mockshim and he joins in.)"
"Ross";"(stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known youboth a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy asyou’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all awayover a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?"
"Chandler";"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot forthe love."
"Monica";"Love is the best medicine."
"Chandler";"That’s laughter."
"Monica";"Why do you do it?"
"Chandler";"I don’t know."
"Ross";"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I do."
"Ross";"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?"
"Monica";"Yes."
"Ross";"(jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!(Storms out.)"
"Gunther";"So I understand you’re looking for a place."
"Rachel";"No-no, I’m staying put."
"Gunther";"Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment."
"Rachel";"Why, where are you going?"
"Gunther";"I don’t know."
"Ross";"(entering) Hey Rach!"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Ross";"You’re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving inagain. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?"
"Rachel";"Oh wow."
"Ross";"Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again."
"Rachel";"Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I reallyappreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’sgonna be weird?"
"Ross";"Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?"
"Rachel";"Well, because of us! Because of our history."
"Ross";"No!"
"Rachel";"No?"
"Ross";"No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are youstill in that place?"
"Rachel";"No! Not at all!"
"Ross";"Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friendswho happen to be roommates."
"Rachel";"Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating."
"Ross";"Really?! We are?"
"Rachel";"Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have agirlfriend…"
"Ross";"Ohh! That would be great."
"Rachel";"But y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’lljust work out a system. Y’know, it’ll be like college, I’ll hang a hangeron the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I’m gettin’ lucky."(Laughs.)"
"Ross";"(laughs as well, but for a different reason) Yeah, I didn’t think ofthat."
"Ross";"So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a"
"Monica";"That’s very funny!"
"Chandler";"He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!"
"Ross";"No, I-I-I’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, youstart fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!"
"Monica";"Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room."
"Ross";"Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room, this isabout what the room…represents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachel’sroom) could destroy you!!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I'm not so worried."
"Monica";"Yeah, no, me neither."
"Ross";"Fine! It’s your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failedattempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one lasttime.) I just don’t want to see you guys break up! Which you"
"Monica";"You still want to move in together right?"
"Chandler";"Of course!"
"Monica";"Ross didn’t scare you?"
"Chandler";"Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him."
"Monica";"Come here, I want to show you something!"

"Joey";"Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before youknow it you’re right where you don’t want to be! Back together!"
"Ross";"Ehh, I don’t, I don’t think so. She’s already talked abouty’know, dating other guys."

"Rachel";"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait aminute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s."
"Joey";"Thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!"
"Joey";"(opening the door to The Potential Roommate) Hi!"
"The Potential Roommate";"Hi!"
"Joey";"Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot ofpeople interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and"
"The Potential Roommate";"Great!"

"Phoebe";"Ross, I know what you’re thinking."
"Ross";"What?"
"Phoebe";"That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fallin love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll justbe happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad."
"Ross";"Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is!"
"Phoebe";"What?!!"
"Ross";"Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her.It’s always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross,why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secretmarriage to Rachel?" You want her!"
"Phoebe";"No! (Ross’s phone rings.)"
"Ross";"(answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?"
"Monica";"Hey Rach, aren’t these candlesticks (holds up a pair) mine?"
"Rachel";"No-no, I bought those."
"Monica";"Ohh! Yeah, I forgot."

"Rachel";"Well, who wouldn’t?!"
"Ross";"I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’stemporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would thatlook great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller.""

"Chandler";"Oh, what’s the matter?"
"Phoebe";"Well, you know that psychic I see?"
"Chandler";"Yeah?"
"Phoebe";"Well, she told me that I’m gonna die this week, so I’m kindabummed about that."
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings,but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get."
"Monica";"Phoebe that’s crazy!"
"Joey";"I can’t believe she would say that too you."
"Rachel";"Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?"
"Phoebe";"I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! Butshe also said one of them would be black."
"Chandler";"Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?"
"Phoebe";"No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the veryend of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’veonly got a week left, y’know? I’ve"
"Ross";"(entering) Hey everyone!"
"Chandler";"Oh hi!"
"Ross";"Hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try itout on you guys, do you, do you mind?"
"All";"Oh that’d be great. Sure!"
"Ross";"(he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly)"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of thesetheories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…""
"Phoebe";"Oh, this is it. This what’s gonna kill me."
"Ross";"(continuing) "…subcategories. The first of these subcategoriesis…""
"Joey";"(interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on thatpiece of paper?"
"Ross";"No! Why?"
"Joey";"Well, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paperthat didn’t have naked chicks on it."
"Ross";"Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) "Thereare three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.(Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each ofthese theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler)into…""
"Chandler";"Why don’t you open with a joke?"
"Ross";"Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!"
"Chandler";"Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re"
"Ross";"(gets up) Okay!"
"All";"Ohh! We’re kidding! Oh, we’re kidding!"
"Rachel";"Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?"
"Ross";"Thank you!"
"Rachel";"Some uh, some visual aides."
"Joey";"Oh-ooh-ooh! Y’know what’s a good visual aide?"
"Ross";"Please don’t say naked chicks."
"Joey";"Why not?!"
"Ross";"I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it.Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks."
"Chandler";"That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19."
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Joey";"Hey! Any good mail?"
"Chandler";"Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild."
"Joey";"Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me,I’m kinda…."
"Chandler";"(opens and reads it) "Benefits lapsed.""
"Joey";"Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move calledbenefits lapsed."
"Chandler";"Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insuranceexpired because, you didn’t work enough last year."
"Joey";"Let me see that!"
"Chandler";"All right."
"Joey";"(reads it) Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insuranceI could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now Igotta be careful?!"
"Chandler";"I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to (pauses) stopcatching on fire."
"Joey";"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see myagent."
"Chandler";"Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
"Joey";"(mocks him, in a whiney voice) …look both ways before you cross thestreet. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing?"

"Rachel";"Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost youforever. Pheebs, you lie down?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm,wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can."
"Rachel";"Monica!"
"Monica";"Hmm? (Rachel holds up the candlesticks.)"
"Rachel";"Did-did you take these back?"
"Monica";"No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought somefor myself."
"Rachel";"Oh yeah, they’re really great! Aren’t they?"
"Monica";"I loved them!"
"Rachel";"Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)"
"Ross";"(entering) Hello!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Monica";"How’d the lecture go?"
"Ross";"It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!"
"Rachel";"Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t moresupportive before."
"Ross";"I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself.Everyone’s all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved themwrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler."
"Monica";"That you’re not funny or sexy?"
"Ross";"That’s right!"

"Estelle";"All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control."
"Joey";"Why?"
"Estelle";"Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you allover town."
"Joey";"Bastard!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Joey";"(in obvious pain) Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for metomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time."
"Chandler";"That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?"
"Joey";"What?!"
"Chandler";"What’s wrong with you?"
"Joey";"Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was liftingweights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. Butum, I don’t think it’s anything serious."
"Chandler";"This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!"
"Joey";"No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anythingit’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and showsChandler.)"
"Chandler";"That’s a hernia."
"Joey";"Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he wasusing.) Damn you 15s!"
"Rachel";"Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15minutes."
"Monica";"Yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch."
"Rachel";"Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I wasa Kappa. (to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica) Wow, we really are bitches."
"Ross";"(to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from thelaboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in factsedimentary. Imagine his consternation when—(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell."
"Monica";"What the hell are you doing?!"
"Ross";"Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring!I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this Britishaccent just came out."
"Rachel";"Yeah, and not a very good one."
"Ross";"Will you-will you please?"
"The Professor";"Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I’m a professor in thepaleontology department here."
"Ross";"Oh."
"The Professor";"Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?"
"Ross";"(in his British accent) I’m sorry, I’ve got plans with mysister."
"Monica";"(in an Irish accent) Monica Gellerrr. (She rolls her ‘R’)"
"Ross";"(in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monicaaside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?"
"Monica";"(normal voice) Oh, you can have an accent and I can’t?! (To anexiting student in accent.) Top ‘O the morning to ya laddies!"
"Ross";"Just please stop!"
"Rachel";"(in an Indian accent) Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year."
"Chandler";"Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.)Sit down! Will you"
"Joey";"Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’sgetting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing."
"Chandler";"I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s justget that thing…pushed back in."
"Joey";"Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and Idon’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks inI can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably startwith that laser eye surgery too."
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"What’s going on?"
"Chandler";"Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing alittle laser eye surgery won’t fix!"

"Phoebe";"Hey! Maybe you’ll die!"
"Joey";"Sure, now I’m scared."
"Phoebe";"No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay?‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday."

"Monica";"You stole them from me!"
"Rachel";"You stole them from me!!"
"Monica";"Gimme them!"
"Monica";"You just wanna each take one?"
"Rachel";"Yeah that seems fair. We never use them."
"Ross";"(entering) Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have tospeak in a British accent?! What do I do?"
"Rachel";"Well…"
"Monica";"Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and peoplewill think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America."
"Rachel";"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’reprobably not even listening!"
"Ross";"They’re not listening too me?"
"Rachel";"Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you."
"Ross";"Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?"
"Monica";"I think you look fine."
"Casting Director #1";"Whenever you’re ready."

"Monica";"Ross!"
"Ross";"Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t faceanother failed marriage."
"Chandler";"Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think thiswas a successful marriage?"
"Ross";"Rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kinda funny. (Helaughs, and he laughs alone.) Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it."

"Phoebe";"(rapidly) I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do youthink they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast?"
"Monica";"Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandlerwith little baby girl Chandler."
"Chandler";"Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right,Coach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenlysmells something. It’s times like these I’m glad Smell-O-Vision hasn’t beeninvented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When you’re done over there, we kinda have asituation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)"
"Phoebe";"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies."
"Chandler";"See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve beenplaying these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense."
"Monica";"What do you mean?"
"Chandler";"I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have ourown zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be incharge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they puttheir hands around… (He degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab hisfinger.)"
"Phoebe";"That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping."
"Chandler";"Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone."
"Monica";"This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at therestaurant."
"Phoebe";"Yeah? (Checking the final diaper) Well this is not what I ordered."
"Joey";"(entering) Hey guys!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey babies! Oh, I’m having the best morning. That uh, that PorscheI’ve got the keys too, still there!"
"Chandler";"Shocking! Since you still have the keys."
"Joey";"You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People arefriendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice aboutmy equity investments."
"Chandler";"What equity investments?"
"Joey";"The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes hisforehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But Ifigured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start tothink that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got abucket and some soap I can borrow?"
"Monica";"Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishingcompound."
"Chandler";"You don’t even have a car!"
"Monica";"I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front ofthe building, so I washed it."
"Chandler";"And?"
"Monica";"And six others."
"Chandler";"There you are."
"Joey";"Yeah, she tops out at 130."
"Guy #2";"Wow!"
"Joey";"And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take herupstate."
"Guy #2";"Really! You got a place upstate?"
"Joey";"Sure!"
"Guy #2";"Well, I’ll see you later."
"Joey";"Okay, take it easy."
"The Porsche Owner";"Hey! That’s my car."
"Joey";"Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it."
"The Porsche Owner";"What-what are you doing?"
"Joey";"Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up."
"The Porsche Owner";"But it’s my car!"
"Joey";"Yeah, but it’s my wax."
"The Porsche Owner";"Listen, I-I-I don’t come to this city much so Idon’t know if you’re crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could Ihave my keys."
"Joey";"Sure. Here. (He hands them over.) I’ll uh, save your parking spot."
"The Porsche Owner";"I’m not coming back."
"Joey";"Why not?"
"The Porsche Owner";"I live upstate."
"Joey";"Yeah, so did I."
"Phoebe";"I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t knowwhy Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy."
"Monica";"Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same."
"Chandler";"(entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, theycan meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)"
"Monica";"Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out!"
"Chandler";"He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!"
"Phoebe";"No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, lookat his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up."
"Chandler";"They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way overprotective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!"
"Phoebe";"What?!"
"Chandler";"Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to checkon the babies again.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep."
"Monica";"Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being ableto put both legs over your head."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I can still do that."
"Monica";"How are you still single?!"
"Chandler";"(entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybeyou’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy."
"Monica";"Good. What made you change your mind?"
"Chandler";"I swallowed the sonic blaster gun."
"Phoebe";"How did that happen?!!"
"Chandler";"Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And itturns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying tocough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)"
"Monica";"Damnit! Y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watchingthe babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! (He does it again.)"
"Judge";"Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?"
"Rachel";"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out."
"Judge";"So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the groundsthat Mr. Geller is mentally unstable."
"Ross";"Fine, I’m mentally unstable."
"Judge";"And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user."
"Ross";"What?!"
"Rachel";"Uh yes, heroin and crack."
"Ross";"Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!"
"Rachel";"Well, you would know."
"Judge";"Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference beforemarriage?"
"Ross";"Oh, come on!"
"Rachel";"(starts to cry) Ross, please, I found the magazines!"
"Judge";"And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, thatmakes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin."
"Ross";"Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin,I’m not gay, and there is"
"Judge";"That won’t be necessary."
"Ross";"And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!"
"Rachel";"Ugh!"
"Judge";"Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that reallycreates a problem."
"Rachel";"Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!(To the stenographer) And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from therecord?"
"Judge";"Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?"
"Rachel";"Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think."
"Judge";"Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for anannulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce."
"Ross";"(stands up) That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did withyour funny, funny form!"
"Rachel";"(stands up as well) What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated likebunnies nonsense!"
"Ross";"And what—(notices the stenographer is still typing)—What are youtyping that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’ttype that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and inthe process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (He’s still typing.)Stop typing! Stop typing!!"
"Rachel";"(to the judge) Okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping memarried too?!"
"Judge";"You need to get out of my chambers."
"Rachel";"All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and Iam not leaving here until I get one!"
"Ross";"Yeah!"
"Judge";"Would you like to spend the night in jail?"
"Rachel";"And thank you for your time. (They both beat a hasty retreat.)"
"Joey";"(entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes) So the Porsche guy took hiscar back."
"Chandler";"But you found the keys to his clothes?"
"Joey";"No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks Iown a Porsche."
"Monica";"And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing theclothes?"
"Joey";"Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have thecar! Right?"
"Chandler";"That is true."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun."
"Joey";"Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. (Starts toleave.)"
"Monica";"Joey, you know you don’t actually have one."
"Joey";"Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk toher! (Storms out.)"
"Chandler";"Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me."
"Monica";"All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room."
"Phoebe";"What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them!We’re baby-sitting!"
"Monica";"The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own fora while!"
"Phoebe";"But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team!We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!"
"Monica";"He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got togo to the hospital."
"Phoebe";"But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s justgonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years."
"Chandler";"I think that’s gum."
"Phoebe";"I’m pretty sure it’s gun."
"Chandler";"Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go."
"Phoebe";"A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital! (They don’tstop.) No! What would, what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)"
"Joey";"Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?"
"Passerby";"Maybe because you’ve got the keys?"
"Joey";"(to women passing him) Porsche."
"Rachel";"This is totally your fault!"
"Ross";"My fault?! You threatened the judge!"
"Rachel";"Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!"
"Ross";"That was the only way I could get him to"
"Joey";"Hi! How are the Gellers?"
"Rachel";"Don’t call us that! (Storms away)"
"Ross";"The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get adivorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? (Walks on.)"
"Joey";"Hey! It’s Porsche!! (He’s right y’know.)"
"Phoebe";"Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right?Okay, I’m gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I getrid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I’ll set you up with a clean one. (She throws it atthe garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to thefloor and break.) Okay, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just have toclean that up. Okay? ‘Cause let’s face it, we’re at Monica’s. (Shecrawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) I broke it. Allright. Well, that’s just the way that goes. (She throws out both the flowers and thevase.) Okay, good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only twoof you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can’t answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie?Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a"
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey!"
"Phoebe";"(exhausted) How do you feel?"
"Chandler";"Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroythe universe again in twelve to fourteen hours."
"Phoebe";"Okay, so I"
"Chandler";"And protected them from a tornado?"
"Monica";"Oh my God."
"Phoebe";"I know, the babies are asleep."
"Monica";"Phoebe, what, what happened here?!"
"Phoebe";"I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!"
"Monica";"But my apartment!"
"Chandler";"Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph."
"Monica";"But the mess!"
"Chandler";"Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babiesall by herself."
"Monica";"You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out.‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!"
"Chandler";"(pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!"
"Rachel";"(deadpan) Oh honey thank God you’re home, I was getting worried."
"Ross";"I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everythingand I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign."
"Rachel";"Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!"
"Ross";"Y’know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?"
"Rachel";"Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!"
"Ross";"Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about youtold me you loved me"
"Rachel";"Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I wasin love with you!"
"Ross";"Yeah! Right!"
"Ross";"You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s, let’sjust sign the papers. All right? (Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.) What?"
"Rachel";"Nothing. (Sits down.)"
"Ross";"Okay, can we just sign please?"
"Rachel";"Uh-hmm. (Just as Rachel finishes signing her name, Ross yanks each pageout of the way.)"
"Ross";"Congratulations. (Gets up to leave.)"
"Rachel";"Okay Ross, we’re—wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have alittle confession."
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"Well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea."
"Ross";"Excuse me?"
"Rachel";"Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night wewere married?"
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything,but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in thecasino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and Ithought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided firstto get married, and then (Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got usinto this mess."
"Ross";"So then if-if—I mean if you think about it, this is all (Pause.) yourfault."
"Rachel";"Yeah, don’t push it though."
"Ross";"I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought Iwould be divorcing you."
"Rachel";"I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the onethat stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinnerat"
"Ross";"Did I, did I even treat?"
"Rachel";"No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special."
"Ross";"That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I shouldprobably get these to my lawyer’s office."
"Rachel";"Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this."
"Ross";"Eh, no problem."
"Rachel";"I’m gonna need a copy of those."
"Ross";"Totally. (Exits.)"
"Joey";"Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!"
"Woman";"(the same one from before approaches) Hi Joey."
"Joey";"Hey! How you doin’?"
"Woman";"(to her friend) He has the most amazing Porsche under there!"
"Joey";"I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping.(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then thesame guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapsesit. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)"
"Chandler";"(watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stickso that he’s scratching his back with it.) Listen, I’m gonna be moving out so"
"Joey";"Right! And when is that due?"
"Chandler";"First of the month."
"Joey";"And that’s every month?"
"Chandler";"No, just the months you actually want to live here."
"Joey";"Ahhh."
"Chandler";"Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)"
"Joey";"(looking at it) Oh my God!!"
"Chandler";"That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung thiswhole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just coveryou for a while?"
"Joey";"No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore."
"Chandler";"It’s not charity, Joe…"
"Joey";"No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking moneyfrom you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on."
"Chandler";"Okay uh, here’s the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)"
"Joey";"This is how much we pay for electric?!!!"
"Chandler";"Uh, yeah."
"Chandler";"So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?"
"Phoebe";"So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?"
"Chandler";"No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’ttake it."
"Phoebe";"Well, how much do you think he needs?"
"Chandler";"I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know?But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride."
"Phoebe";"Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up andput on little skits. Whatever you want."
"Chandler";"Well that would help the pride thing."
"Monica";"(entering from her room) Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?"
"Monica";"(thinks) Okay."
"Chandler";"Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?"
"Monica";"Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together withRachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is movingin with Phoebe."
"Phoebe";"And also, my birthday."
"Monica";"It’s not your birthday."
"Phoebe";"What a mean thing to say! I would"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?"
"Chandler";"Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing."
"Ross";"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guyswould come over and watch it."
"Joey";"I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gaveup a career in basketball to become a paleontologist."
"Ross";"I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!"
"Rachel";"(entering from her room) Pheebs, I was wondering…"
"Monica";"You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in"
"Rachel";"Well and clearly not a minute sooner."
"Monica";"Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me thatyou’re packed."
"Rachel";"Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe heropinion on what I should wear tonight."
"Phoebe";"My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place."
"she’s";"she’s"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you."
"Rachel";"Yeah, yeah, I know."
"Phoebe";"Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that."
"Monica";"(entering) Rachel, I need to borrow—"
"Rachel";"Surprise!!"
"Monica";"What?"
"Rachel";"No, no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. SoI-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!"Right? But you"
"Monica";"(grabs a bag of those Styrofoam peanuts) I’ll be coordinator! Oh myGod! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help!Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe?"
"Phoebe";"I have plans."
"Monica";"You’re plans were with us."
"Phoebe";"That’s right."
"Monica";"All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can liftthings. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!"
"Phoebe";"Okay."
"Monica";"Okay! (To Rachel) Oh my God, thank you!!"
"Phoebe";"Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs foreveryone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves! (The guys scramble for thedoor.)"
"Monica";"(entering and interrupting the guy’s escape attempt) Okay! Themovers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help!Chandler, we’re gonna start with…"
"Chandler";"Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey."
"Monica";"I thought you said you were going to do nothing."
"Chandler";"Yes, but for the last time."
"Monica";"Okay fine, now Ross…"
"Ross";"Oh, but-but I can’t do it."
"Monica";"Why not?"
"Joey";"(quietly) I’ve got Ben."
"Ross";"Because, because I’ve got Ben."
"Monica";"It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime.Where-where is he?"
"Chandler";"He’s at a dinner party."
"Monica";"Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!"
"Ross";"Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as anexcuse? What kind of father do you think I am?"
"Monica";"All right, sorry. (Goes back to Rachel’s room.)"
"Ross";"(to the guys) I gotta go make a fake Ben."
"Joey";"Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates."
"Chandler";"Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese."
"Joey";"Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. Me,bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!"
"Chandler";"Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night.What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?"
"Joey";"What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injuryplagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money."
"Chandler";"Yes it would. What do you say to $50?"
"Joey";"Okay, you’re on."
"Chandler";"Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently."
"Rachel";"Ohhhhhh, look it’s the roller blades."
"Monica";"(starting to cry) Oh God!"
"Rachel";"You remember when we got these?"
"Monica";"No."
"Rachel";"I guess you weren’t there. (They hug.)"
"Phoebe";"You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember thetime… (She starts laughing hysterically.) You don’t remember?"
"Rachel";"I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’mleaving."
"Monica";"I’m gonna miss you so much."
"Phoebe";"Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybeinstead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should likethink of the things you’re not gonna miss."
"Monica";"I don’t think there’s anything."
"Phoebe";"Come on, there’s gotta be something."
"Monica";"Nope, she’s perfect."
"Rachel";"I have one."
"Phoebe";"Good! Great! You can go first."
"Rachel";"Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re"
"Phoebe";"Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? DoesRachel move the phone pen?"
"Monica";"Aw, sometimes. Always, actually."
"Phoebe";"Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?"
"Monica";"Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages."
"Rachel";"You get your messages!"
"Monica";"Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read themoff the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch."
"Rachel";"So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler?Or your mom?"
"Phoebe";"Great! It worked! No one’s sad."
"Joey";"(scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That’s like 500 bucks you owe me!Whoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.)$500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, there’s nothing in the fridge.)Whoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food."
"Chandler";"Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, onegoal, $1,000."
"Joey";"You serious?"
"Chandler";"Oh yes!"
"Joey";"Okay, get ready to owe me!"
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Joey";"Okay, here we go. Ready?"
"Chandler";"No! No! No! No—(Joey looks at him)—one can beat me."
"Chandler";"See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to doall the kicking."
"Monica";"Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Ross! (To Rachel) See? Other people call me!"
"Rachel";"Ooh, your brother. Score!"
"Monica";"(on phone) What’s up?"
"Ross";"Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi."
"Monica";"Oh, put him on!"
"Ross";"Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he hascreated out of a pumpkin.) Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now.He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, rememberthe roller blades?"
"Rachel";"You know what else I’m not gonna miss? "I’m Monica. Iwash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!""
"Monica";""Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’dbetter wash it and shrink it!""
"Rachel";""I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interestingpeople. Ever!""
"Phoebe";"Hey! I call her!"
"Monica";""Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hateRoss!""
"Rachel";""Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’lljust stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!""
"Phoebe";"Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinnerreservations. (Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)"
"Chandler";"Still broken?"
"Joey";"This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two mostimportant things in my life, the foosball table and $500."
"Chandler";"Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about alittle uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)"
"Joey";"Nah, not my game."
"Chandler";"Okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? We could play anew game. A new game, it’s fun."
"Joey";"Well, what’s it called?"
"Chandler";"Cups."
"Joey";"I don’t know how to play Cups."
"Chandler";"I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it’s really easy andreally, really fun."
"Joey";"All right."
"Chandler";"Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens,what do you have?"
"Joey";"A two and a five."
"Chandler";"Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!"
"Joey";"Really?!"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again. (He deals out two cards eachagain.) What do you got?"
"Joey";"A four and a nine."
"Chandler";"You’re kidding right?"
"Joey";"No. Why?"
"Chandler";"Well that’s a full cup! (Pays him again.)"
"Joey";"Damn! I am good at Cups!"
"Monica";"I’m not talking to her!"
"Phoebe";"Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you,because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!"
"Monica";"Well, maybe you’re right—She made fun of my phone pen!"
"Phoebe";"I know, I took it hard too."
"Monica";"Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about—What are you doing? (Shesees that Rachel is unpacking.)"
"Rachel";"I’m unpacking!"
"Monica";"What?!"
"Rachel";"I’m not moving! (She re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) Is thatpicture straight?"
"Monica";"It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!"
"Rachel";"Hey, y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this bigchange and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have toleave?!"
"Monica";"Because it’s my apartment!"
"Rachel";"Well it’s mine too! What else you got?!"
"Monica";"How about, you’re moving!! (Grabs a bunch of clothes and throwsthem into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packingthe same stuff over and over again as Rachel chants "No." and Monica chants"Yes.")"
"Rachel";"Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks overMonica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)"
"Phoebe";"Hey, how are you guys doing?"
"Rachel";"Great! Monica’s moving!"
"Monica";"(entering) I am not!"
"Rachel";"Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica startschasing Rachel around the table.)"
"Phoebe";"Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay,you guys…"
"Monica";"No Phoebe I am mad!"
"Phoebe";"Well, deep-deep-deep down!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I’m just mad!"
"Phoebe";"Then keep running. (They resume the chase.)"
"Chandler";"You win."
"Joey";"Well, what did you have?"
"Chandler";"It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. Thatmy friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?"
"Joey";"Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700."
"Chandler";"Not 700 exactly?"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"Double it! (He does.)"
"Joey";"What?"
"Chandler";"Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it."
"Joey";"Really?"
"Chandler";"Hey, I didn’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive thedoubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing yourtotal to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Don’t get to excited because that’s notgonna happen unless you get—No way! (He takes the top card, which is the two ofclubs. Of course, any card would’ve won. Chandler pays him.)"
"Monica";"Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna labelit, "What were you thinking?""
"Rachel";"Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that onChandler."
"Phoebe";"Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, Idon’t want to live with Rachel anymore."
"Monica and Rachel";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end uplike that with Rachel. I still like you!"
"Rachel";"Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving."
"Monica";"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know I-I-I said somereally bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has"
"Rachel";"Oh really? Like what Monica?"
"Monica";"Y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots…"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah, good start Mon."
"Monica";"She lets you borrow them."
"Rachel";"Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet."
"Monica";"Do you wanna live outside?! Because it’s gettin’ cold! (ToPhoebe) She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the thingsshe thinks that I’d like."
"Phoebe";"What else?"
"Monica";"When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror."
"Rachel";"Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that."
"Phoebe";"That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom."
"Monica";"When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with ablanket."
"Rachel";"Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold."
"Monica";"And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she wasreally supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. Andnow you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)"
"Rachel";"Oh, it’s gonna be fine."
"Phoebe";"Okay Rachel, I can’t"
"Rachel";"But honey, I think she’s moving in with Chandler."
"Phoebe";"Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that?"
"Monica";"Kinda. (She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to itto get a better look.) Oh my God!"
"Ross";"(answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, how’s the packinggoing? (Listens) Ben? He’s fine. Yeah, he’s right—Oh my God! (He looks overat the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirtthere son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah,it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack."
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"What’s wrong?"
"Joey";"Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500to him in Cups!"
"Chandler";"Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!"
"Joey";"The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Rossgets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross wasgetting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’teven get half a cup! Nothin’!!"
"Chandler";"Oh man!!"
"Joey";"And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I thinkbeginner’s luck,"
"Chandler";"All right, let’s play one more hand! One more!"
"Joey";"No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time!In-in fact, look, there’s a—I wanna give you something. And let me give it tooyou know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I wantyou to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such agreat roommate."
"Chandler";"I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!"
"Joey";"It’s him, not it!"
"Chandler";"No, but wait—what if I bought it from you, y’know? And yournice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?"
"Joey";"Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’retrying to give me money again!"
"Chandler";"When did I try to give you money?"
"Joey";"Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried togive some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice lastnight together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Nowout of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!"
"Chandler";"I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure thatyou’re okay."
"Joey";"I"
"Monica";"Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?"
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Monica";"I’m really gonna miss you."
"Rachel";"Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)"
"Monica";"Thanks."
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Oh God! This is silly, I’m gonna see you in a couple of hours!(They hug again.)"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Bye house!"
"Rachel";"Bye Mon."
"Monica";"Bye."
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey."
"Monica";"She really left."
"Chandler";"I know. (He kisses her.)"
"Monica";"Thank you."
"Chandler";"No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)"
"Monica";"Can I ask you a question?"
"Chandler";"Sure!"
"Monica";"What the"
"Chandler";"I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money."
"Ross";"And now you want that money back."
"Chandler";"Exactly."
"Ross";"Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up thefake Ben.)"
"Chandler";"It’s not a real game! I made it up!"
"Ross";"I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square."
"Chandler";"At a fake game!!"
"Ross";"Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to playyou for it. But I should warn you, I am"
"Chandler";"Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last."
"Ross";"No."
"Chandler";"Hmm, let’s see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cardsand shrugs.)"
"Phoebe";"Ready?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"Okay."
"Rachel";"Hi..."
"Phoebe";"it's..."
"Rachel";"Rachel..."
"Phoebe";"and…"
"Rachel";"Phoebe’s..."
"Phoebe";"please..."
"Rachel";"leave..."
"Phoebe";"leave…"
"Rachel";"Wait, I-I just said "leave.""
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get"it’s," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it."
"Rachel";"Phoebe, come on that's silly."
"Phoebe";"All right, so let's switch."
"Rachel";"No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch."
"Phoebe";"Okay."

"Phoebe";"Please...wait, how did you do that?"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?"
"Rachel";"Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go runningbefore it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!"
"Phoebe";"Really?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our firsty’know roommate bonding thing."
"Phoebe";"Okay, let's go running!"
"Rachel";"Yeah and there's really cute guys there."
"Phoebe";"Let's run towards them!"
"Rachel";"OK!"
"Phoebe";"All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.Please leave a message, thanks!"
"Rachel";"Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!"
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green."
"Ross";"So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll becomputers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. Sotheoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-andlive forever as a machine."
"Chandler";"(not amused) And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open."
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Ross and Chandler";"Hey!"
"Monica";"(jumps over a box) Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to thefloor!"
"Chandler";"I didn't nail the boxes to the floor."
"Monica";"Oh, So you"
"Chandler";"Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story foryou."
"Joey";"Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be mynew roommate!"
"Janine";"Hi."
"Ross";"Hi! (Rushes over to shake her hand instantly.)"
"Janine";"Hi"
"Joey";"Yeah, she's gonna live with me!"
"Monica";"It's nice to meet you. Janine...?"
"Janine";"Lecroix. Janine Lecroix"
"Joey";"I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!"
"Chandler";"So, uh, wh-where ya from?"
"Janine";"Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago."
"Joey";"(shocked) From the land down under? I didn't know that either!"
"Ross";"So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?"
"Janine";"I'm a dancer."
"Joey";"You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!"
"Janine";"Well, I think I'll go and unpack."
"Joey";"Oh, hey let me. (Opens the door for Janine and after he closes the doorbehind her gasps ecstatically.)"
"Monica";"Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?"
"Joey";"Of course I did."
"Monica";"Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?"
"Joey";""When can you move in?""
"Ross";"Thank you for bringing her into our lives."
"Chandler";"Unbelievable"
"Monica";"Oh, so you like her too Chandler?"
"Chandler";"Hey, look at all the boxes!"
"Joey";"Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!"
"Monica";"Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate.It-it'll be way too complicated."
"Ross";"Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can'tdate her."
"Chandler";"All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out withthat girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumpedinto each other at the supermarket?"
"Joey";"Oh God, yeah."
"Chandler";"Now imagine you"
"Joey";"(happily) Okay!"
"Chandler";"No-no"
"Joey";"Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!"
"Monica";"Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in suchclose quarters, it could be trouble."
"Joey";"Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around anattractive woman and not flirt."
"Monica";"(chuckles) Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt."
"Joey";"You a little sad about that sweetheart?"
"Phoebe";"I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up."
"Rachel";"Okay. (Runs off.)"
"Phoebe";"Okay. (Starts running crazily with her arms flapping and her legs farapart) Come on! That's not running! Let's go! (Rachel pauses, then follows, embarrassed.)"
"Rachel";"You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross betweenKermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man."
"Ross";"Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster everynight before she went to bed."
"Rachel";"Oh! I used to do that too!"
"Monica";"Did you also have his album,"
"Rachel";"Aw, Mon...(Kisses her on the cheek)"
"Monica";"So, Phoebe runs weird huh?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I justdon't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her."
"Monica";"Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth."
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth."
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!"
"Phoebe";"Why? Why would you do that?"
"Monica";"I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles."
"Rachel";"Ankle."
"Monica";"We'll see."
"Chandler";"OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. (Turns aroundand sees that Joey isn't there.) Joe? (Hears giggling coming from a box) Well, I guessJoey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack. (Hears thegiggling again)"
"Joey";"(jumps out of the box) I Gotcha!!"
"Chandler";"(pretending) Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack."
"Joey";"Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looksgreat!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica’s gonna be workinglate, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know whatelse I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now whowouldn't wanna live with me?"
"Joey";"(raises his hand) I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australiandancer."
"Chandler";"Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirtingthing?"
"Joey";"Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built upflirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. (Gives Chandler the"Joey-love," look.) How"
"Joey";"(voice cracking) Ohhhh man"
"Janine";"Sorry, there's just more room out here."
"Joey";"No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I needto do my stretches too. (Starts to stretch, groans painfully)"
"Janine";"(touches his waist) Why don't you try to do-"
"Joey";"(jumps up and yells)"
"Janine";"What's wrong?"
"Joey";"Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm allsweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. (Goes into the bathroom and comes backout quickly) Oh my God!"
"Phoebe";"(jumps in front of Rachel) Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grabyour running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself."
"Rachel";"No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually justchecking to, see, if I could run. And I can!"
"Phoebe";"Please Rachel, I am not an idiot. (Runs off)"
"Rachel";"No, wait Phoebe."
"Ross";"(enters) Wow, couples who live together"
"Chandler";"What does it look like I'm doing?"
"Ross";"Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?"
"Chandler";"Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back."
"Ross";"Put it back"
"Chandler";"Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross)"
"Ross";"‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping."
"Chandler";"She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place."
"Ross";"Whoa, hello, did you just"
"Chandler";"She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it."
"Ross";"Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to moveback in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me."
"Chandler";"I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out."
"Ross";"Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right.Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God,she's going to sit on you."
"Chandler";"No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her rightnow. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh."
"Monica";"(on phone) Hi!"
"Chandler";"Hey Mon, how's it going?"
"Monica";"Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself.Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight."
"Chandler";"Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad."
"Monica";"It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'mgonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early."
"Chandler";"No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there."
"Chandler";"It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! (To Ross) She's-she's gonna kill me."
"Ross";"Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. (Chandler fixes it and a pictureframe off the table.) And that goes back up there."
"Chandler";"We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be theeasiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. (He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I gotit. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)"
"Ross";"Yeah that-that, doesn't look right."
"Chandler";"What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with thecarpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up onthe...(Tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they won't reach) OK, OK, here'swhat we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table."
"Ross";"Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back ofthe carpet."
"Chandler";"OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch."
"Ross";"Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in theseating area."
"Chandler";"Yes, but the coffee table doesn't matchthe...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!"
"Joey";"(entering) Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'mdrawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! (Tries to put his feet on the coffeetable...they won't reach and looks around.) What the hell's going on over here?!?!?(Points to Chandler) Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to dosomething to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women allthe time."
"Ross";"Hey, I've been married 3 times"
"Joey";"No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman butsomehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?"
"Ross";"Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue."
"Chandler";"Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and wewent to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could notstop talking about the Irish potato famine?"
"Ross";"Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either.After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh""
"Chandler";"Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that."
"Ross";"Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science."
"Chandler";"That's not specific to girls."
"Joey";"This is great, this is great, what else, what else?"
"Ross";"Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar."
"Chandler";"And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny."
"Ross";"They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you."
"Chandler";"Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica."
"Ross";"(nonchalantly) I'm never gonna find love again."
"Rachel";"Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?"
"Phoebe";"Sure"
"Rachel";"Okay, um, I...(Phoebe walks into her room.) All right Phoebe look, Ijust wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should nothave lied to you."
"Phoebe";"So, what should you have done?"
"Rachel";"Well, I-I should've told you the truth."
"Phoebe";"Uh-Huh, Which is...?"
"Rachel";"Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is becauseum, well y'know the way that you run is a little...(Starts flapping her arms)"
"Phoebe";"So?"
"Rachel";"Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy."
"Phoebe";"Why do you care?"
"Rachel";"Because they're people."
"Phoebe";"But people that you don't know and will never see again."
"Rachel";"Yes, but still. They're people…with eyes."
"Phoebe";"Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss (panting). But no,okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay.You're uptight."
"Rachel";"I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight,man."
"Phoebe";"That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me.I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it'sfun. Y'know, I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna falloff? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away fromSatan? (Rachel looks confused) The neighbor's dog."
"Chandler";"Okay, is this lamp in the same place?"
"Ross";"Who cares? I repel women."
"Chandler";"(blocks the door) No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here!R-r-r-r-Ross is naked."
"Monica";"What?!"
"Ross";"(whispers) What?!"
"Chandler";"(to Ross) I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed toosee me naked."
"Ross";"Why does"
"Monica";"Why is Ross naked?"
"Ross";"I-I had to show Chandler something?"
"Monica";"Naked?"
"Ross";"Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem."
"Monica";"Is it the same thing that Chandler had?"
"Chandler";"Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and youcan come back later."
"Monica";"Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sinkin the bathroom. Bye!"
"Chandler";"Bye! Thank God"
"Ross";"Dude, what'd you have?"
"Chandler";"Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everythingback into its original place."
"Ross";"(realizes something) The photo album! There were millions of pictures ofthe apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to thepictures."
"Chandler";"That's perfect! That's brilliant! (Starts going through the photoalbum)"
"Ross";"So really, what'd ya have?"
"Janine";"Hey Joey, I got some beer for you."
"Joey";"Uh, don't you mean "for whom?""
"Janine";"Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?"
"Joey";"Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh."
"Janine";"Is there something wrong?"
"Joey";"All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You'rehot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates andit's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road."
"Janine";"Joey..."
"Joey";"No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket andyou will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?"
"Janine";"Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you'rereally sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that."
"Joey";"Oh!"
"Janine";"No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommateand your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel"
"Joey";"Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on."
"Janine";"I don't think so."
"Joey";"Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How"
"Janine";"I'm OK"
"Joey";"What?!?!"
"Janine";"What?"
"Joey";"Oh dear God!"
"Rachel";"(Runs into Phoebe.) Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!"
"Phoebe";"See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a secondcause then you're gone!"
"Rachel";"Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. (Turnsand bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! (Runsoff.)"
"Monica";"Is it okay for me to come in now?"
"Chandler";"Uh-huh"
"Monica";"Why is everything different?"
"Ross";"Bye! (Runs out)"
"Chandler";"No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the roomgot so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)"
"Monica";"Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even getme started on the refrigerator magnets."
"Chandler";"Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes Iwanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I movedeverything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm verysorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
"Monica";"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?"
"Chandler";"Do you want me to be afraid of you?"
"Monica";"Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's awonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I wanteverything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that."
"Chandler";"Really?"
"Monica";"Of course!"
"Chandler";"Oh well you're the best. You come here to me."
"Monica";"All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. (Gets her cleaning gloveson) Okay, now did Ross sit"
"Ross";"So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry outthe same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could downloadour thoughts and our memories into this computer..."
"Janine";"...and live forever as a machine!"
"Ross";"That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing rightnow? You and I, we're interfacing."
"Janine";"Yeah, I gotta go."
"Chandler";"Ba dum bumb cheshhh!"
"Joey";"Hey."
"Chandler";"Hi, my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I waswondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for controlof the galaxies last remaining energy source?"
"Joey";"Sure, neighbor come on in."
"Chandler";"So, is Janine around?"
"Joey";"Uh, no, she’s at dance class."
"Chandler";"Can I check out what she did to my room?"
"Joey";"Yeah, but, hey look, don’t go through her stuff. She gets reallymad.(Chandler gives him a look and walks to the door of his old room.)"
"Chandler";"(The room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) Ohmy God. What is th… it’s like a guy never lived in here. Look, you’ve gotto be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. (Looking around the living room.) It’sspreading already."
"Joey";"(Looking around the room.) It is???"
"Chandler";"(Picking up a pillow.) Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on thecouch?"
"Joey";"No."
"Chandler";"(Pointing to the table and picking up the box.) Is that your tiny littlebox, that’s too small to put anything in?"
"Joey";"No."
"Chandler";"No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If youlet this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff."
"Joey";"(With Big Eyes.) All right, you’re right. I’ll talk to her."
"Chandler";"Yes talk to her. Be a man."
"Joey";"I’m a man."
"Chandler";"Defend yourself."
"Joey";"(Grunting) Hmm. (Monica opens the front door and comes in.)"
"Monica";"Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle."
"Chandler";"Be right there sweetums. (Monica leaves. To Joey.) A totally differentsituation."
"Monica";"Hey guys."
"Chandler";"Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?"
"Monica";"It was okay. She’s still kind of depressed because she broke up withher boyfriend."
"Chandler";"Ohh, yeah."
"Ross";"Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Ross";"The one that always stares at me when I come in?"
"Monica";"No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way."
"Ross";"Still I could tell. She was into me. (Joey rolls his eyes.) Well, whydon’t you set us up?"
"Rachel";"Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?"
"Phoebe";"(Walking over and Sitting down.) Hey."
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Phoebe";"Rachel?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"I’m, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, canI come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine."
"Rachel";"Well, sure, but they might think it’s kinda weird considering Idon’t work there anymore."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God. What happened?"
"Rachel";"I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren."
"Phoebe";"Well that’s great! Congratulations!! (She hugs Rachel.)"
"Rachel";"Yeah. (chuckling) A year ago.."
"Phoebe";"(Hugging her again.) You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you."
"Rachel";"But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But,just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out andshe already doesn’t like me very much."
"Chandler";"That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either."
"Monica";"I don’t think mine likes me either."
"Ross";"Maybe it’s a universal thing?"
"Joey";"Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on aWednesday. (Everybody gets up.)"
"Chandler";"Yeah let’s head off to work."
"Monica";"We should go."
"Phoebe";"Thank you."
"Rachel";"Sure."
"Phoebe";"Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies,and Ralph Lauren came in."
"Rachel";"Oh my God. Did you talk to him?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser."
"Rachel";"What? What!?! You kissed him?"
"Phoebe";"Totally."
"Rachel";"(Gasps) Phoebe are you serious?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know,we’re making out. You know."
"Rachel";"Phoebe, I mean, you do know he’s married?"
"Rachel";"Phoebe…"
"Phoebe";"What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he’smarried? (Rachel looks at her.) No, yeah, I should."
"Janine";"Hey Joey."
"Joey";"Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Doyou, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?"
"Janine";"No, I just thought it was cute."
"Joey";"Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh…Look Janine I reallywant you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It’s…too girly."
"Janine";"Ohh. Like what?"
"Joey";"Like this. (pointing to the picture) Pictures of cute babies we don’tknow. We..we can’t have that."
"Janine";"Joey, it’s Anne Geddes. She’s a famous artist."
"Joey";"Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famousartist or not. You know, and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing toomuch around here."
"Janine";"Well, I’m sorry. I just thought I’d try to make the place alittle nicer."
"Joey";"Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and thefoofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can."
"Janine";"Well I just thought…"
"Joey";"I’m sure it’s a famous watering can, okay. But, come on…andwhat is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?"
"Janine";"It’s a curling iron."
"Joey";"Ohh, well, that’s ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come into the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It’s up here onsome hook..and…smells different."
"Janine";"It’s clean."
"Joey";"Yeah, well, it feels different."
"Janine";"It’s dry."
"Joey";"Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels…Also what is withthese chips you bought?"
"Janine";"No no no no, it’s potpourri. You’re supposed to smell it. (Joeytakes a big whiff of the potpourri.)"
"Joey";"(Voice cracking) Well that’s like summer in a bowl."
"Rachel";"Oh, Kim, Hi. (Kim doesn’t even look up from her report.)"
"Kim";"Uhh-huh."
"Rachel";"So you know, I…I handed in that marketing report and I never got tohear what you thought."
"Kim";"I didn’t read it."
"Rachel";"Ahh….So…Wow…The spring line, it’s really going to begreat this year, huh?"
"Kim";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.(Kim stops the elevator and turns to Rachel.)"
"Kim";"Tell me everything."
"Ross";"Hey guys."
"Chandler and Monica";"Hey."
"Ross";"What’s up? (He smiles. His teeth are freakishly white.)"
"Chandler";"You know…Oh My God."
"Monica";"What happened to your teeth."
"Ross";"I whitened them."
"Chandler";"(Sarcastically) Really."
"Ross";"Yeah. What do you think."
"Monica";"Well, I think I shouldn’t look directly at them."
"Ross";"Come on, seriously."
"Monica";"Ross they’re really, really, really white."
"Chandler";"Yeah, what was wrong with your old…human teeth."
"Ross";"Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to."
"Monica";"How much longer?"
"Ross";"A-A day."
"Monica";"Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?"
"Ross";"I know. That’s why I did it. (With a big smile) Come on, are they reallythat bad?"
"Chandler";"No, no no no. You’ll be fine. (turning to Monica) Hillary’sbind, right?"
"Monica";"She will be after tonight."
"Chandler";"Yeah. (Rachel walks in.)"
"Ross";"Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…"
"Rachel";"Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. (Sitting down on thecouch.) You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren."
"Chandler";"What???"
"Monica";"Oh my god."
"Rachel";"Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just…made out. Andthe craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said itwas the best gossip she’d heard all year."
"Chandler";"I am proud of all my friends today."
"Monica";"My God, Rachel, I can’t believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.Ohh, I’m so jealous. (Chandler looks at her.)"
"Chandler";"Hi, I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy"
"Monica";"Chandler, please, come on. Look at him. (Pointing to a picture of Ralph ona magazine,.)"
"Chandler";"Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish. (Phoebe walks in.)"
"Phoebe";"Hey. Here. (Hands Chandler a copy of her flyer and sees the picture ofRalph.) Ohh, who’s the silver fox?"
"Rachel";"That-that is your make out buddy. Don’t you recognize him? (Holding upthe magazine in front of her face.) Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please."
"Phoebe";"That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, no, Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy.He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack."
"Rachel";"Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copyguy."
"Phoebe";"What?"
"Rachel";"Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. Ifshe finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more."
"Phoebe";"Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?"
"Rachel";"To get you to make out with him!!!"
"Phoebe";"Ohhh."
"Monica";"(Holding a shirt in front of Ross.) Okay, maybe this will make your teethlook less white. (Ross has a big smile.) Nope. Okay, colors that don’t work are blue,yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple."
"Ross";"I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like anhour."
"Monica";"Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look sobright."
"Ross";"Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you."
"Monica";"I’m just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you."
"Ross";"Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore."
"Monica";"Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working."
"Ross";"But, won’t she notice I have makeup on?"
"Monica";"Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on."
"Ross";"What??"
"Monica";"All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see."
"Ross";"No. I am not putting on makeup. (Knock at the door. Phoebe enters.)"
"Phoebe";"Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? (Hesmiles at her.) OH!! Demon!! Demon!!"
"Monica";"Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose."
"Chandler";"Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’mgoing to go over to Joey’s."
"Monica";"Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer."
"Chandler";"Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminineside enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming alesbian couple."
"Monica";"You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right,I’m sorry."
"Chandler";"Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. Youknow, do kind of like a man thing."
"Monica";"Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beerand hammer up some drywall."
"Chandler";"You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer andhammer up drywall?"
"Monica";"When girls hang out, we don’t have pillow fights in our underwear.(Chandler gets a hurt look on his face.) I’m sorry. We do. We do. I don’t knowwhy I said that."
"Joey";"Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders."
"Chandler";"No thanks, Josephine."
"Chandler";"Hey Ross, I was wondering if…"
"Rachel";"Ohh, hi, Kim."
"Kim";"Hi Rachel."
"Rachel";"Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well itdidn’t happen."
"Kim";"You didn’t cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?"
"Rachel";"Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone madeout with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true."
"Kim";"That’s not true?"
"Rachel";"No."
"Kim";"Oh that’s interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used toaccess the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel."
"Rachel";"Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him."
"Kim";"Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. Youare sadly mistaken."
"Rachel";"I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. Idid not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. Idon’t even know how to use my keycard. (The elevator stops. Ralph steps on.)"
"Kim";"Hi Ralph."
"Ralph Lauren";": Hi Kim. (Dead silence until Ralph gets off the elevator.)"
"Kim";"Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife."
"Hillary";"And after that, what could I do except become a chef."
"Ross";"Mmm-Hmm."
"Hillary";"And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant."
"Ross";"Mmm."
"Hillary";"You know, you’re a really great listener. Most guys I go out with,they just talk and talk."
"Ross";"Mm-Hmm."
"Hillary";"After a while it’s like, shut your mouth, you know?"
"Ross";"(Chuckling) Hmm-Hmm."
"Hillary";"I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about youa little bit?"
"Ross";"Mmm-Unmm."
"Hillary";"Come on. I want to know."
"Ross";"Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Putting his hand up to block his mouth.) Okay. I, uh, am fromLong Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in myspare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm."
"Joey";"So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in afrying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer."
"Monica";"Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip."
"Chandler";"Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl withthe flowers."
"Monica";"Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you tomake a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter."
"Joey";"Ohh, I love birds. (Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)"
"Chandler";"What is the matter with you ?!?"
"Joey";"What?"
"Chandler";"You’re arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) Yougot dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This isnot Joey!!"
"Joey";"Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know,they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of afamous baby."
"Chandler";"You’re turning into a women."
"Joey";"No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean."
"Chandler";"Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?"
"Joey";"It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God,I’m a women!!!"
"Rachel";"Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job."
"Phoebe";"But why didn’t you just tell her the truth."
"Rachel";"I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuseKenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren."
"Phoebe";"Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? Youknow. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did sheever think of that?"
"Rachel";"You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?"
"Phoebe";"Just for a second."
"Rachel";"Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?"
"Phoebe";"Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren."
"Rachel";"I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but Iwouldn’t."
"Phoebe";"Ohh, sleep with Kenny."
"Rachel";"That wouldn’t help me."
"Phoebe";"Ohh, yes it would."
"Hillary";"I’ve had a really good time tonight."
"Ross";"Mmm."
"Hillary";"You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date."
"Ross";"(Giggling) Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Picking up a piece of bread and covering his mouth.)Me, neither. I’ve had a really good time too, you know. (Putting the bread down.)"
"Hillary";"Are you going to eat that bread?"
"Ross";"(Putting the bread up to his nose.) Ohh, I just like the smell. (Sniffingit.) Mmmm."
"Hillary";"(Laughing) You make me laugh."
"Ross";"Hmm-Hmm."
"Hillary";"Would you like to move over to the couch?"
"Ross";"Mmm-Hmm. (Picking up their wine glasses.)"
"Hillary";"Maybe I’ll just turn the lights down a little."
"Ross";"(Covering his mouth with the glass.) How about all the way."
"Hillary";"Okay. (She goes to turn the lights off and Ross sits on the couch. She hassome black light posters on the wall.)"
"Ross";"(Looking at the posters.) Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster?(They sit down on the couch. Ross smiles and the black light fluoresces his teeth.) So,ahh, where were we?"
"Hillary";"Are those your teeth??"
"Ross";"Ohh, you can see them, huh?"
"Hillary";"Yes. They’re insanely white."
"Ross";"I-I, did that for you."
"Hillary";"What’s a matter with you?"
"Ross";"What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!"
"Rachel";"Kim, hi."
"Kim";"Hi Rachel. Ohh, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new RalphLauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have."
"Rachel";"Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You wereright. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore."
"Kim";"Oh, really?"
"Rachel";"(Faking crying.) Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can’t dothis. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this.I’m married and I’m sorry." And then I don’t know why but he said,"and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog inthe Ralph Lauren machine.""
"Kim";"You expect me to believe..(Doors open, Ralph steps in.) Hi Ralph."
"Ralph Lauren";": Hi Kim. (Dead silence again until he gets off.)"
"Kim";"Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It’s likehe hates you. Then it is true."
"Rachel";"Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad."
"Kim";"Ohh honey come here. (Hugging Rachel.) Ohh it will be ok. We’ve all beenthere."
"Rachel";"You and Ralph?"
"Kim";"Kenny the copyboy."
"Janine";"Hey."
"Joey";"Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you."
"Janine";"What’s the matter? Are you upset?"
"Joey";"I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff inhere. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay?That’s just the way it has to be."
"Janine";"Well, if that’s what you want. I’ll just put it all in my room."
"Joey";"Great…Great…and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, Ididn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know. (She starts to collect all thegirlie stuff up.) You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, ifyou want to."
"Janine";"Okay."
"Joey";"And, uhh, maybe the watering can there."
"Janine";"Sure."
"Joey";"And a couple of these little tiny boxes."
"Janine";"Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?"
"Joey";"(Smiling) Okay."
"Monica";"(on phone) Okay, great!  Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.) Soguess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?"
"Chandler";"Sydney Portier? Hehheh."
"Monica";"(not amused by Chandler’s joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, myparents."
"Chandler";"Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I movedin!"
"Monica";"Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we livetogether, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking wewould eat around four."
"Chandler";"(shocked at the news) Why can’t I tell them that we livetogether?"
"Monica";"Because they don’t know we’re dating. (Again, trying toquickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink andthe stove to cook.)"
"Chandler";"Why haven’t you told them?!"
"Monica";"Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, justout of nowhere, I didn’t."
"Chandler";"Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!"
"Monica";"(trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen aroundfour! I’ll see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the livingroom.)"
"Chandler";"Why wouldn’t they be happy?"
"Monica";"Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry."
"Chandler";"What? What? Why?!"
"Monica";"Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re reallysarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off yourclothes and throw them on the couch."
"Chandler";"Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?"
"Monica";"Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’tcare what they think. I’m sorry."
"Chandler";"Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when theycome over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and thenwe’ll tell ‘em."
"Monica";"You really think that’ll work?"
"Chandler";"Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?"
"Monica";"(hugging Chandler) I don’t think you’ll ever get my parentsthat drunk!"
"Chandler";"Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! You’re parents like me,right?"
"Ross";"(only half-paying attention) Yes, of course they like you!"
"Chandler";"Well Monica just told me that they don’t."
"Ross";"(not paying attention) Yeah, they don’t like you."
"Chandler";"(annoyed) Do you know why?"
"Ross";"I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybeit’s cause you uh-"
"Chandler";"(angry) Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!"
"Chandler";"This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for."
"Joey";"Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?"
"Chandler";"Maybe I could give thanks by taking my"
"Joey";"Well maybe I love ya’."
"Chandler";"[mocks that last comment]."
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Janine";"Hey guys!"
"Janine";"Are you guys going to Chandler’s for Thanksgiving?"
"Joey";"Yeah! Yeah, why? What’s up?"
"Janine";"Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgivinguptown. I thought you guys might like to come."
"Ross";"For real?"
"Janine";"No, but you should go to Chandler’s. Because none of us knows howto cook, we’ll probably just end up drinking all day."
"Joey";"Ye-ye, we go to yours!"
"Ross";"Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s mysister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because itreally helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that."
"Janine";"(not sure of what to make of that) Okay."
"Joey";"How you got three women to marry you, I’ll never know."
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"All";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen tomake a traditional English truffle!"
"Phoebe";"Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in caseRachel’s dessert is...[about to say “bad”] so good that I eat all of it.There’s none left for anybody else!"
"Monica";"Nothing."
"Monica";"No, sweetie, I-I trust you."
"Rachel";"So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?"
"Monica";"You’re not gonna mess it up."
"Rachel";"Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you.Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?"
"Monica";"Well, it’s done about two minutes before it looks like that."
"All";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!"
"Ross";"And the place looks so nice!"
"Joey";"Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!"
"Ross";"Happy Thanksgiving!"
"Joey";"Well, this has been great!"
"Ross";"See ya!"
"Monica";"Whoa whoa whoa! Where’re you goin’?"
"Ross";"Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’sroommate is having."
"Monica";"Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?"
"Ross";"Some would say she’s attractive, yes."
"Phoebe";"And who else is going to be there?"
"Joey";"Uh, some of her friends, yeah."
"Rachel";"Her dancer friends?"
"Joey";"(frustrated) Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna bethere and they’re gonna be, be drinkin’ and dancin, and we really wanna go!"
"Ross";"(to Joey) Dude, we were good!"
"Monica";"You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, andyou’re gonna eat here!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not veryThanksgivingy."
"Ross";"Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, whenthe Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner."
"Joey";"Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot inthe new world!"
"Mrs. Geller";"Hello everybody!"
"Mr. Geller";"Hi!"
"All";"Hi!"
"Monica";"Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is it’sChandler!"
"Mrs. Geller";"(less than pleased) Oh yes of course, hello Chandler."
"Chandler";"Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear,let us take off your coats!"
"Chandler";"Whoa, snowing out there?"
"Mr. Geller";"(angry) No."
"Mr. Geller";"Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doingthis for a living."
"Mr. Geller";"Ok, I have dandruff. There’s no need to laugh and point."
"Monica";"Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke."
"Mr. Geller";"My joke wasn’t funny."
"Phoebe";"Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller lastnight."
"Rachel";"Really?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was sobrave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know,I mean he used to be just, y’know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad”and now he’s he’s “Jack Geller, dream hunk.""
"Rachel";"I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be “Jack Geller, walksin while you’re changing.”"
"Monica";"Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt thathow a young man turns out is a reflection on his father."
"Mr. Geller";"I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?"
"Chandler";"(worried) He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show."
"Joey";"Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already?Those drunken dancers are waiting!"
"Rachel";"(looking at her truffle) Look at it, isn’t it beautiful?"
"Ross";"Yeah, yeah, what is it?"
"Rachel";"It’s a truffle. It’s got all of these layers. Firstthere’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made fromscratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, thenbeef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] thena little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!"
"Ross";"W-What was the one right before bananas?"
"Rachel";"The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y’know, Ithought “well, there’s mincemeat pie,” I mean that’s an Englishdessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. [To Joey]Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?"
"Joey";"Y-sure!"
"Ross";"Ross:"
"Ross";"Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!"
"Joey";"I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?"
"Ross";"Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!"
"Joey";"(turning to Chandler in a scolding tone) Chandler!"
"Ross";"Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd’sPie!"
"Joey";"(sad) Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonnaget to introduce the hot girls to the new world!"
"Ross";"No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up."
"Joey";"Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?"
"Ross";"Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!"
"Joey";"(shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) Vomiting stories arefunny..."
"Rachel";"Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!"
"Joey";"Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?"
"Rachel";"No!"
"Phoebe";"Rachel?"
"Rachel";"Yeah?"
"Phoebe";"Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’tgive to be that can of (looks closer to see what Jack is drinking) condensed milk."
"Monica";"Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is."
"Mrs. Geller";"Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it."
"Chandler";"Oh, yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored andtight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked.Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I don’t mean tight, I mean it’snot too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into hishands.]"
"Mr. Geller";"What’s the matter with him?"
"Mrs. Geller";"(whispers to Jack a little loudly) I think he’s stoned again."
"Chandler";"(shocked) What?"
"Ross";"(worried) Dude, I need to talk to you a sec."
"Ross";"Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you."
"Chandler";"You do? Why?"
"Ross";"Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I gothigh in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you hadgotten stoned and jumped out the window."
"Chandler";"What?! Why did you do that?"
"Ross";"I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that poppedinto my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter."
"Chandler";"How could it not matter?!"
"Ross";"How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college,let alone you-you would be living with my sister?"
"Chandler";"What about all that “friends forever” stuff?"
"Ross";"I don’t know, I-I was all high."
"Monica";"Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler)were trying to get Ross stoned!"
"Chandler";"Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it onme!"
"Monica";"Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!"
"Chandler";"The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is becausethey hate me, okay? So will you fix this?"
"Ross";"Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high.Now who should I say it was?"
"Monica";"You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t stilldo it or anything!"
"Ross";"Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?"
"Monica";"Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and ifyou’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the-"
"Joey";"(to Rachel) Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told youthat all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinkingalot!?"
"Rachel";"(sarcastically) No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s soromantic."
"Joey";"Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?"
"Rachel";"Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This isthe only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh, remember thatThanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”"
"Rachel";"So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and youjust worry about eating it, alright?"
"Joey";"Oh I am!"
"Monica";"Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!"
"Ross";"Okay, fine!"
"Joey";"Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?"
"Ross";"Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. Noit can’t? Okay."
"Joey";"Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert."
"Ross";"What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!"
"Joey";"Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they’re allgonna’ make fun of her, do you want that?"
"Ross";"Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it.That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!(Referring to the dancers.)"
"Joey";"(scolding) Dude, they’re not objects."
"Joey";"Just kiddin,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach."
"Ross";"Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?"
"Rachel";"Okay..."
"Rachel";"What’s up, Ross?"
"Ross";"So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?"
"Rachel";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"And um...You look nice today."
"Rachel";"Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this."
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea."
"Ross";"(shocked) Eh?"
"Rachel";"I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can berough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now."
"Ross";"(cutting her off) You’re alone."
"Rachel";"No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re [pity-tone]"
"Ross";"(just trying to get out of the conversation) Ah well, can’t blame aguy for trying!"
"Joey";"Oh and (Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some gibberish word toindicate to Ross that he’s not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Okay, and uh ifanyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh,rubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying “mmm” and uh, oh oh!And smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore."
"Joey";"Rachel, there you are! Come on, let’s serve that dessert already!"
"Rachel";"Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? Youdon’t get any dessert."
"Joey";"(happily) Really?"
"Rachel";"No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody,it’s trifle time!"
"Phoebe";"So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn’t it?"
"Rachel";"It sure is."
"Phoebe";"Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?"
"Rachel";"Beef."
"Phoebe";"I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat. (Fakingdissapointment.) Ohhh no."
"Rachel";"Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste."
"Monica";"Really?"
"Rachel";"Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take abite with all the layers!"
"Monica";"Okay."
"Rachel";"Op! Wait, you dropped a pea."
"Rachel";"Well?"
"Monica";"(faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joeysaid) Mmmm! It’s good!"
"Rachel";"Really? How good?"
"Monica";"It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only onewho’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is.Especially Ross."
"All";"(faking enjoyment) Mmm."
"Chandler";"(clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, thatI’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy mydessert."
"Mrs. Geller";"(lying) I’ve gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how goodthis is, from Monica’s room."
"Mr. Geller";"(also lying) I’ll help you dial."
"Monica";"(again, lying) I’m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at itin the mirror, as I eat it."
"Rachel";"Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let metry it."
"Ross";"Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. Helooks like he’s going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler hassome left."
"Ross";"It tastes like feet!"
"Joey";"I like it."
"Ross";"Are you kidding?"
"Joey";"What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood."
"Rachel";"...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and,and then just dropped it on the street?"
"Chandler";"(lying) Yes, but if it’s any consolation, before the bird droppedit, he seemed to enjoy it."
"Phoebe";"Rachel, come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down onthe lounge-chair.) Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I hadanother dream about Jack."
"Rachel";"Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?"
"Phoebe";"I dunno, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna getmarried, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a nightclub, and I saw him making out with a girl."
"Rachel";"(humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betrayingme! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse,who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen."
"Mr. Geller";"Boy, I’m glad I wore the big belt today."
"Phoebe";"Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Nownothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman."
"Monica";"Ross? Let’s go."
"Ross";"Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing aletter."
"Monica";"Alright, you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance."
"Ross";"Wha-what?"
"Monica";"(out loud, to her parents) Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!"
"Mrs. Geller";"Mrs. Geller:"
"Ross";"(in a 5 year old’s tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom,Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?"
"Mrs. Geller";"Mrs. Geller:"
"Ross";"Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me.I’m sorry."
"Mrs. Geller";"It was you?"
"Monica";"And Dad, y’know that mailman that you got fired? He didn’tsteal your Playboys! Ross did!"
"Ross";"Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing, Monicadid!"
"Monica";"Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year!"
"Ross";"Monica and Chandler are living together!"
"Monica";"Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!"
"Phoebe";"(joining in) I love Jacques Cousteau!"
"Rachel";"(reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) Iwasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!"
"Joey";"(pounding the table) I wanna gooooooo!"
"Mrs. Geller";"(rubbing her temples) That’s alot of information to get in inthirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren’tsupposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I’m sorry, but Ithink Jacques Cousteau is dead. (Phoebe makes a sad face.) Monica, why you felt you had tohide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me."
"Mr. Geller";"And we kinda figured about the porch swing."
"Mrs. Geller";"Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?"
"Mr. Geller";"What happened son?"
"Ross";"I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!"
"Mrs. Geller";"Chandler! You’ve been Ross’s best friend all these years,stuck by him during the drug problems. (Ross gets disgusted.) And now you’ve taken onMonica as well. Well, I don’t know what to say. You’re a wonderful human being."
"Chandler";"Thank you!"
"Mr. Geller";"No! Thank you! (Hugs Chandler) Monica, and Ross! I don’t knowwhat I’m gonna do about the two of you!"
"Chandler";"(In a parent-like tone) I’ll talk to them!"
"Rachel";"You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe thatyou ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!"
"Monica";"Well actually, I-I didn’t eat mine. It’s still in thebathroom."
"Joey";"No it isn’t, I ate that."
"Mrs. Geller";"(pointing to herself and Jack) Well we left ours in Monica’sbedroom."
"Joey";"Nope, got it and I got yours (Pointing to Jack) too."
"Chandler";"Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? Iremember when people used to use big lights."
"Rachel";"That’s a good story, Grandpa."
"Ross";"Hey"
"All";"Hey"
"Ross";"Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Didsomeone get her drunk again or?"
"Monica";"Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about.It’s about being with the people that you love."
"Phoebe";"That is nice and we’re done. TADA!"
"Chandler";"I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas tome."
"Monica";"Oh, here."
"Chandler";"See now it feels like Christmas!"
"Ross";"… and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some peopletrace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches intotheir huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death.And that was like 4000 years ago."
"Rachel";"So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling thisstory."
"Joey";"Hey you guys."
"Chandler";"Hey Joe what’s up?"
"Joey";"I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over theplace. Y’know, everywhere I look she’s like… (He imitates her stretching)"
"Chandler";"I can see why that’s hard to resist."
"Joey";"I like her so much!"
"Monica";"Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way."
"Joey";"I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brushher hair."
"Chandler";"You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?"
"Ross";"I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot,but now she’s like OLD NEWS!"
"Janine";"Hey guys!"
"Ross";"Hi Janine!"
"Janine";"I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for NewYear’s Eve. It’s called some sort of Dick’n Rock’n Dickie Eve."
"Monica";"Hold it! Are you talking about"
"Janine";"Yeah, that’s what I said."
"Monica";"Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching itsince I can remember!"
"Chandler";"Ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you?(He kisses her on the cheek)"
"Janine";"Well I’m gonna be on it this year. I’m gonna be one of theparty people."
"Ross";"You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!"
"Janine";"Well they said I should bring someone. (To Joey) Do you wanna be mydance partner?"
"Joey";"Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you."
"Janine";"Well actually they’re taping tomorrow. I don’t reallyunderstand why."
"Ross";"Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in TimesSquare is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not alot of people know that."
"Janine";"Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?"
"Ross";"Are you serious?"
"Monica";"We are there!"
"Chandler";"What, what are you laughing at?"
"Rachel";"Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her!"
"Janine";"Thanks. (To Monica and Ross) Great so we can all go together! I gottarun. Catch you later!"
"All";"Bye!"
"Ross";"Bye Janine!"
"Joey";"Did she just ask me out on a date?"
"Chandler";"I don’t think so."
"Monica";"What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party ofthe millennium!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry,but I don’t think that was a romantic thing."
"Joey";"Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a NewYear’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back,great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I cansay ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’"
"Rachel";"Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in HighSchool, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick."
"Ross";"It was a dry day."
"Monica";"We are going to"
"Ross";"Oh my God!"
"Monica";"Oh my God!"
"Chandler";"(To Rachel) Oh"
"Joey";"OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a littleadvice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal.The important thing to remember – stay cool."
"Ross";"Got it!"
"Ross";"Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it!"
"Director";"OK, everyone gather up."
"Ross";"Ross:"
"Director";"Here’s what’s gonna happen. The music’s gonna start,you’re gonna dance, we’re gonna tape, you don’t look at the camera. Anyquestions?"
"Ross";"Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?"
"Director";"Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and Iwant you two right around here, and everyone else spread out."
"Joey";"Ross! So when is it gonna air?"
"Rachel";"Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet."
"Chandler";"I can save you time ladies, I’m right here."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concernyou."
"Rachel";"We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica."
"Chandler";"What? That’s terrible!"
"Phoebe";"No-no, we do it every year!"
"Chandler";"Oh well, that makes it not terrible."
"Phoebe";"No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wilyminx."
"Rachel";"Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, themwe’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK?"
"Chandler";"No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents!"
"Phoebe";"But we have to!"
"Chandler";"No, you don’t have to, and you can’t because I live heretoo."
"Phoebe";"Well then, you should look with us."
"Chandler";"Why?"
"Rachel";"Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica forChristmas?"
"Chandler";"No, I have a great idea for a present for her."
"Phoebe";"Oh, that’s it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea!"
"Rachel";"Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a greatpresent, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gottenher one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you dothat to her Chandler? Why? Why?"
"Chandler";"If I help, we can find ‘em faster!"
"Rachel";"That’s right!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh ooh, we have a live one!"
"Rachel";"Oh, it’s a"
"Phoebe";"Ooh, who’s it for?"
"Phoebe";"Uh-oh. She may be onto us."
"Rachel";"We are so gonna find them this year."
"Chandler";"Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall andlook, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under mygym bag or anything?"
"Chandler";"Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store thatI’ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! (He does a weirdclicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)"
"Monica";"Okay, here comes another camera."
"Ross";"Right. No biggie. Stay loose."
"Ross";"Why do they keep doing that?"
"Monica";"If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of thoseplatforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day."
"Ross";"Right."
"Ross";"Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?"
"Monica";"Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put onunderpants?"
"Ross";"Yeah!"
"Janine";"Hey! You’re a good dancer!"
"Joey";"Really?"
"Janine";"Yeah, well you’d be better if you just loosened your hips a little."
"Joey";"What do you mean?"
"Janine";"Like this."
"Janine";"That’s it, feel the rhythm. That’s better."
"Joey";"Uh-huh."
"Director";"(To Joey) Okay, you’re dancing with that girl over there."
"Joey";"No-no-no-no-no we came together!"
"Director";"I don’t see it. (To Janine) You are dancing with the tall guyover there. Tall guy, raise your hand! (He does. Janine goes over to him.)"
"Joey";"No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her andI think I have a shot."
"Director";"Really, y’think so? I don’t.."
"Chandler";"I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind somecoats."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!"
"Chandler";"Those are my gifts, I got them for you."
"Phoebe";"Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!"
"Rachel";"Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?"
"Chandler";"Those are book ends! That's a great gift!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz."
"Rachel";"Ha!"
"Chandler";"Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?"
"Rachel";"Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice ofyou that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!"
"Joey";"Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. (The girl startsdancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against aplatform) Here we go. (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really out of placedance) Looking good Gellers!"
"Ross";"We know!"
"Monica";"Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He’s the one who decides whogets up on the platform. We should go dance by him."
"Ross";"Okay."
"Director";"Okay, everybody hold!"
"Director";"Next on the platforms are… (He points to the right of Ross andMonica, so they dance over to where he’s pointing to. He points away from them)…you two! And… (He points the other way, and Ross and Monica follow his arm.Again he points away.) …You two!"
"Monica";"Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren’t wearing underpants?"
"Ross";"Monica! (Pause) Would it?"
"Joey";"Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl thatyou’re dancing with."
"Joey";"Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had thisplan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I’m trying to win her over, so Iwas wondering if.."
"Joey";"Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh,mellow!"
"Joey";"Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know…"
"Joey";"Alright, alright, hey y’know fair is fair, (he pretends to wash hishands) if you’re right, you’re right, what can I say, but hey oh no! (He throwswater on the guy’s pants)"
"Joey";"Hey, now you’re the one who wet his pants. (He throws another handfulon him and runs out)"
"Monica";"Man, this sucks! Y’know if Mom and Dad don’t see us on TVafter we made them so jealous, I mean, who’s gonna be the losers then?"
"Ross";"Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform!"
"Monica";"What?"
"Ross";"The routine!"
"Monica";"Ross, we haven’t done the routine since middle school."
"Ross";"Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll wanna buildus our own platform!"
"Monica";"Was it really that good?"
"Ross";"We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category!Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?"
"Monica";"Okay, let’s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!"
"Monica";"5 6 7 8!"
"Ross";"So, do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platformnext?"
"Director";"Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!"
"Monica";"Yes! (They run over to a platform)"
"Director";"(To Cameraman) Make sure you get this, they’re gonna want it forthe bloopers show. (To everyone) Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start againit’s gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody’s excitement."
"Director";"What’s going on over here?"
"Joey";"Uh, take a look at the guy’s pants! I mean, I know you told us toshow excitement, but don’t you think he went a little overboard?"
"Director";"What’s the matter with you? Get out of here!"
"Joey";"Yeah, take a hike wetpants!"
"Ross";"Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for theMillennium moment!"
"Monica";"I know! Hey, you haven’t been practising the routine, have you?"
"Ross";"No!"
"Monica";"Me too!"
"Ross";"Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goindinto the robot, y’know? (He mimics a robot)"
"Monica";"Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna lookstupid!"
"Director";"Alright we’re back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine!Eight! Seven! (He continues to count as we hear Joey think)"
"All";"Three, Two, One!"
"Director";"Cut!"
"Joey";"No! Year! Happy No Year!"
"Director";"Okay, here’s where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nicework everyone that’s a wrap!"
"Phoebe";"Hey! Look who I found!"
"Chandler";"Oh, hey guys!"
"Phoebe";"Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thoughtmaybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden."
"Chandler";"Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter."
"Phoebe";"Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No!Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!"
"Chandler";"Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonderwhat I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?"
"Phoebe";"Hmm, how about my azzz?"
"Rachel";"Hey, this is hollow."
"Phoebe";"What?"
"Rachel";"This bench, it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that!(She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh, the presents!!!"
"Phoebe";"No, don’t look directly at them!"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Alright, no, we could look at them!"
"Rachel";"Oh, this one’s for me!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, this one’s for Chandler. Here."
"Chandler";"Oh great!"
"Phoebe";"And the big one’s for me!"
"Rachel";"Ooh, let’s open them!"
"Chandler";"Okay! Okay! Okay!"
"Phoebe";"Hee hee!"
"Chandler";"Wait, we can’t do this."
"Phoebe and Rachel";"Why?"
"Chandler";"I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean, look,I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me,and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not whatChristmas is about."
"Rachel";"Whatever Linus, I’m opening mine."
"Chandler";"Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don’t know about you guys,but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present, and I’msure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just,can we put them back?"
"Phoebe";"Will you get us better gifts?"
"Chandler";"Fine!"
"Monica";"Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find thepresents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?"
"Chandler";"That’s what you got me?"
"Phoebe";"Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless."
"Joey";"Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know howthe New Year’s gonna go off. I guess there’s no reason for all that Y2K panic,y’know? Anyway, g’night!"
"Janine";"Joey."
"Joey";"Yeah?"
"Janine";"(She takes his hands) 3, 2, 1. (She kisses him) Happy New Year."
"Joey";"Oh, yoii. What was that for?"
"Janine";"Well, I don’t know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn’tget to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you"
"Joey";"Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment."
"Janine";"In the moment, yeah."

"Joey";"No."
"Janine";"Me neither."
"Joey";"3, 2,"
"Janine";"Joey, you don’t have to count down every time we kiss."
"Joey";"Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds toget ready."
"Monica";"We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the newMillennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’"
"Rachel";"Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine fromeighth grade?"
"Monica";"Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. (To Ross) Hey, bythe way, great thinking about catching me!"
"Rachel";"‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done theend the way you guys did it back then!"
"Monica";"What? We could do it!"
"Ross";"I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, strongerback then."
"Monica";"I can do it, okay? Come on, let’s go. (She and Ross get up)"
"Monica and Ross";"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Ross runs to be caught byMonica, but she moves out of the way)"
"Monica";"I can’t do it! (Ross falls into Monica’s room)"
"Chandler";"Now you do that, you’re on TV."
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?"
"Monica";"Honey, we have been through this before!"
"Rachel";"Yeah. Don’t do this to yourself."
"Phoebe";"She’s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen."
"Joey";"Well all right then, I guess I shouldn’t get to excited about thefact (excitedly) that I just kissed her!"
"Monica";"You serious?!"
"Chandler";"That’s great!"
"Monica";"Really?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah well, we’ll see."
"Ross";"You kissed her."
"Joey";"Oh we kissed it up real nice."
"Chandler";"So you kissed her, so what happened after that?"
"Joey";"I came over here to tell you guys."
"Chandler";"So she’s just waiting over there for ya?"

"Joey";"Okay. (They kiss.)"
"Janine";"I’m gonna be really late for dance class!"
"Joey";"Okay. (They kiss.)"
"Janine";"Okay, now I’m really late. (Gets up.)"
"Joey";"Okay, I’m all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?(She kisses him on the cheek and starts to leave.)"
"Janine";"(to Monica and Rachel) Bye."
"Monica";"Bye. (Janine exits.)"
"Joey";"Have you kissed her yet? It’s awesome! I could do it forever!Y’know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!"
"Monica";"I am"
"Rachel";"I know."
"Chandler";"(entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have"
"Rachel";"Oh-oh,"
"Chandler";"I’m not your garbage man. I’m your mailman."
"Rachel";"Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Showsher the picture.)"
"Monica";"You got it from"
"Rachel";"Yeah! It’s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what anapothecary is?"
"Chandler";"A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)"
"Monica";"Rach, Phoebe hates"
"Joey";"I hate"
"Chandler";"You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!"
"Joey";"(indignant) I was tired!"
"Rachel";"Phoebe hates"
"Monica";"Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture shouldhave a history, a story behind it."
"Rachel";"Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the wayfrom the White Plains store."
"Monica";"It’s gotta be one of a kind. Y’know like umm, y’know uh,what’s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?"
"Joey";"Hey! I made that for her!"
"Chandler";"You made pottery?"
"Joey";"Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage."
"Monica";"I’m telling—If you put that in her apartment you’ll neverhear the end of it."
"Rachel";"Okay fine! I’ll-I’ll just tell her it’s an antiqueapothecary table, she doesn’t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at thislittle drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs."
"Chandler";"Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore…"
"Chandler";"…so then the farmer says, "That’s not a cow andyou’re not milking it." (Everyone laughs.)"
"Monica";"I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always lookingfor a couple to go out with and now we have one!"
"Chandler";"Look at us, we’re a couple of couples!"
"Janine";"I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant."
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Joey";"And Chandler I can’t believe I let you pay for this one. (They hugand he whispers in his ear.) Thanks man."
"Monica";"So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I’ll make that pasta thingI was telling you about."
"Janine";"Oh that would be great!"
"Joey";"Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine."
"Monica";"Joey, you don’t have too!"
"Joey";"Nope-op! I insist! (He hugs Chandler again and whispers to him.) You getthe wine right?"
"Chandler";"Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay, good night guys."
"Joey";"See ya tomorrow!"
"Monica";"Tomorrow!"
"Janine";"Can’t wait! (They each go into their respective apartments.)"
"Janine";"How are we gonna get out of that one?"
"Joey";"What?"
"Janine";"I can’t handle two nights in a row with them."
"Joey";"What-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?"
"Janine";"I don’t know, they’re just a little blah!"
"Joey";"Blah?!"
"Janine";"Well y’know, he’s blah, she’s just—she’s veryloud for such a small person."
"Joey";"Uh, they’re like my best friends. Are you saying we can’t hangout with them? ‘Cause that would kinda be a problem."
"Janine";"No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y’know, not twonights in a row. Okay?"
"Joey";"I guess."
"Janine";"Thank you. (They kiss.)"
"Joey";"If you want, I’ll sell my friends and use the money to buy youpresents."
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"(sees the table) Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?"
"Rachel";"Guess!"
"Phoebe";"Umm, a flea market?"
"Rachel";"Ha! See, I knew, I knew you’d get it on the first guess. Isn’tit cool! It’s an apothecary table."
"Phoebe";"Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where (She’s opening andclosing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions."
"Rachel";"Ohh, yes."
"Phoebe";"Y’know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium."
"Rachel";"Almost."
"Phoebe";"How much was it?"
"Rachel";"It was only 500 bucks."
"Phoebe";"500 bucks at a flea market?!"
"Rachel";"Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it wasnew, y’know like back then."

"Rachel";"I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your tableshe’s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original."
"Ross";"Why did you do that?"
"Rachel";"Because she hates"
"Ross";"She hates"
"Rachel";"I know! I know, she says it’s all mass-produced, nothing isauthentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So comeon, she’s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?!Please?"

"Joey";"Well uh, she didn’t want to hang out with you guys two nights in arow. I’m so sorry."

"Monica";"(loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?"
"Chandler";"So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She waslying to our faces?!"

"Rachel";"That’s funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Ross’s table.)"
"Ross";"Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new…(OnRachel’s glare)…old sheet?"
"Phoebe";"Oh sure! (She goes to take her feet off, but drags the sheet with herwhich spills the wine.) Noo!"
"Rachel";"Ohh!!"
"Ross";"My apothecary table!!!"
"Phoebe";"What?!"
"Rachel";"Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact sameapothecary table they have.)"

"Chandler";"Perfect decibel."
"Monica";"(loudly) I know!!!"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Joey";"So uh, what are you guys doing?"
"Chandler";"Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah."
"Joey";"Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, Icame over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine."

"Joey";"Ha-ha, very funny—Look! I don’t know what to do! I really wantyou guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!"
"Monica";"We owe you?!"
"Joey";"That’s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of yourrelationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked likean idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!"
"Monica";"We didn’t give you any money! (Chandler is motioning,"No!")"
"Joey";"You don’t think I know that!"
"Rachel";"…see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the newwicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table."
"Ross";"Wow! I didn’t know that there was a"
"Rachel";"I know, I know. I went a little crazy."
"Ross";"A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that!The ornamental bird cage! Large!"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Phoebe";"(sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? EarlyColonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that."
"Ross";"(glaring at Rachel) Fascinating."
"Phoebe";"(gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!"
"Rachel";"Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonialtimes."
"Phoebe";"Ah!"
"Ross";"Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some othertime periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)"
"Rachel";"Well there’s yore. And uh, y’know, yesteryear."
"Phoebe";"Yeah no, I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for thisstuff. Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think thatyou should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help."
"Rachel";"Oh honey he doesn’t need my help."
"Phoebe";"Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you callit? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk."
"Ross";"Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, y’know what? Since you have such a greatsense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you takePhoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff."
"Rachel";"(not sure of what to do) Y’know what? I don’t, I don’tthink Phoebe really wants to come."
"Phoebe";"No! I do want to!"
"Rachel";"Oh, she does want to."
"Ross";"She does want to."
"Phoebe";"Yeah!"
"Rachel";"Pheebs, I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was justbetter last time."
"Phoebe";"Well at least I got these sheets for Ross."
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"Uck, look at this!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, y’know what? Don’t look at it. (Realizes the display istheir living room) Seriously, don’t look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)"
"Phoebe";"No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!"
"Rachel";"Ugh, those bastards! Let’s go."
"Phoebe";"That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the…wait asec! This is our exact living room!"
"Rachel";"No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours istotally different! I mean we don’t have the… (Looks desperately for somethingdifferent.) We don’t have the…that lamp! And-and that screen is y’know, onthe other side."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff,"
"Rachel";"Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I knowhow you feel about"
"Phoebe";"No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything thatis wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I canthink about is how I don’t have that lamp!"
"Rachel";"Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross."
"Phoebe";"I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-thatyou would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?"
"Rachel";"What?! No! I’m not gonna move out!"
"Phoebe";"But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy thatlamp?"
"Rachel";"(gets it) Oh. Yes! I would"
"Phoebe";"Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!"
"Rachel";"That’s right!"
"Phoebe";"But at least the apothecary table is real."
"Joey";"Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?"
"Janine";"Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I’ve got to say, I’msorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervousor something."
"Chandler";"That’s totally understandable."
"Monica";"Don’t worry about it."
"Janine";"So we can go out again?"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah!"
"Monica";"Absolutely!"
"Janine";"Oh good."
"Joey";"Oh well then, good night!"
"Monica";"Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)"
"Joey";"See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?"
"Janine";"We have"
"Monica";"(bursting in) I"
"Chandler";"And I’m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watchingmodern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) "Oh Chandler,I just lost myself in the moment.""
"Janine";"Y’know, I know you’re talking, but all I hear is, "Blah.Blah. Blah-blah-blah.""
"Monica";"(steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Let’s go! Rightnow!"
"Joey";"All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler andMonica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)"
"Chandler";"(To Monica) Y’know I think you can take her."
"Monica";"(to Janine) You’d better hope I don’t see you in the hallway!!(They exit.)"
"Joey";"All right, uh, we’ve got a little bit of a problem here. These peopleare my friends; you can’t treat them that way."
"Janine";"They said stuff to me too, y’know!"
"Joey";"I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean somuch to me. They… They’re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting allthe time, I-I… I don’t think we can be together. It just, it just can’twork. It can’t. (Starts to break up) I’m very upset."
"Janine";"Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?"
"Joey";"Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for herand she exits into the hallway.)"
"Monica";"What did I tell you about the hall?!"
"Janine";"I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I’dreally like it if we could be friends."
"Monica";"Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too."
"Janine";"Great."
"Monica";"Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, I’m glad we worked thingsout."
"Janine";"Me too."
"Monica";"Okay."
"Janine";"I’ll see you."
"Monica";"Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)"
"Janine";"(muttering to herself) Or I’ll hear you."
"Monica";"(hearing that) That’s it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt withthe garbage bag) Come on!"
"Janine";"Wait! (Janine pauses, then runs down the stairs.)"
"Monica";"(chasing her) You’d better run!"
"Chandler";"Did you hear that?"
"Joey";"Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I’m sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?"
"Joey";"Yeah! (They head downstairs.)"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Joey";"How ya doin’?"
"Chandler";"Hey so, did uh, did she move out?"
"Joey";"Pretty much, yeah."
"Monica";"I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that."
"Joey";"Well, when it’s not right, you know it."
"Chandler";"You okay?"
"Joey";"Yeah! Yeah. I’ll be all right."
"Ross";"Y’know what would cheer you up?"
"Joey";"What?"
"Ross";"I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I thinkyou should come."
"Joey";"(laughing hysterically) You’re right! That did cheer me up!"
"Ross";"Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent itin to"
"Phoebe";"I didn’t know"
"Ross";"Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s notjust about the pictures."
"Monica";"That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us."
"Chandler";"That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up."
"Ross";"What?"
"Chandler";"I made that joke up."
"Ross";"Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did."
"Chandler";"Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniestjoke he’d ever heard."
"Ross";"Hey, tell Dan, ‘Thanks.’"
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"I’m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one isfunny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)"
"Chandler";"Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?"
"Monica";"No."
"Chandler";"Seriously?"
"Monica";"Well, you tell a lot of jokes!"
"Ross";"Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel anybetter they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit,right?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I guess."
"Joey";"(entering) Hey guys."
"Ross";"No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’lltell you."
"Chandler";"It’s my joke."
"Ross";"It’s my joke."
"Joey";"Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there,right?"
"Chandler";"Dude, you have got to turn on"
"Joey";"Let’s go watch it at your place."
"Chandler";"Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’twant to miss when they were skinny."
"Joey";"Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go outand get some new sunglasses."
"Chandler";"What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and thescreen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?"
"Joey";"No, that’s"
"Chandler";"Joey, why is your cable out?"
"Joey";"I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill"
"Chandler";"If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you somemoney?"
"Joey";"No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been alittle tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot."
"Chandler";"Whoa ho."
"Joey";"I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen tothe radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the"
"Chandler";"(picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealerwill let us watch the show at his place?"
"Joey";"Sure."
"Chandler";"(with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phonebill?"
"Joey";"Not so much."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey."
"Phoebe";"Wh-wh-what are you doing?"
"Rachel";"We are looking at a"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out apicture). Yikes!"
"Monica";"So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell astory?"
"Rachel";"Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she haslost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where arethey, where are they?’"
"Monica";"Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that."
"Phoebe";"Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn,lift up your shirt, and bend over?"
"Rachel and Monica";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’soutdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come inhandy"
"Monica";"Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date,who would it be?"
"Rachel";"(thinks) I don’t know."
"Monica";"Me neither."
"Phoebe";"Rachel."
"Monica";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"I don’t know. (Pause) Me neither."
"Joey";"You forget how many great songs Heart had."
"Chandler";"Yeah."
"Ross";"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard."
"Chandler";"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it."
"Joey";"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, butI’m not even sure I got it."
"Ross";"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey."
"Chandler";"And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions."
"Chandler";"(stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke."
"Ross";"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is whyhe sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars."
"Chandler";"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money."
"Ross";"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll showthe sexy teller that I am a published writer."
"Chandler";"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke."
"Ross";"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?"
"Chandler";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"Well, I’m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down)."
"Chandler";"Okay (he goes to sit down)."
"Gunther";"(handing Joey the bill) Here you go."
"Joey";"Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m notworking, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff."
"Gunther";"Well, if you want, you can work here."
"Joey";"Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on asoap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have towait on all my friends."
"Gunther";"Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel asmuch as you want."
"Joey";"What?!"
"Gunther";"Flexible hours."
"Joey";"Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?"
"Monica";"(visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it,but it was obvious. She picked Rachel."
"Monica";"It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel."
"Chandler";"You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Rossdid? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know?And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes."
"Monica";"That’s a good idea."
"Chandler";"Yeah!"
"Monica";"Do you know what’s a bad idea?"
"Chandler";"Picking Rachel."
"Monica";"That’s right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hearsomething?"
"Chandler";"Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealingmy thoughts."
"Monica";"It’s coming from the living room."
"Joey";"(sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat backto bed.)"
"Monica";"(entering) Hey, you guys."
"Phoebe and Rachel";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Monica, what are you doing?"
"Phoebe";"I guess it was kinda funny."
"Phoebe";"Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel thanyou is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okaylet’s go to lunch!"
"Monica";"That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay,prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!"
"Phoebe";"No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re justnot as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’sall."
"Rachel";"(To Monica) Well, people are different."
"Phoebe";"Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want.Y’know, you can just walk all over her."
"Rachel";"What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover?I’m not a pushover."
"Phoebe";"Oh, okay, (laughing) you’re not a pushover."
"Rachel";"Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, youknow what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I thinkthat’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go tolunch. (She leaves)"
"Rachel";"I cannot believe her."
"Monica";"I know. Where do you wanna go eat?"
"Rachel";"Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place."
"Monica";"I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there."
"Rachel";"All right, wherever you wanna go is cool."
"Monica";"All right."
"Ross";"(showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check thisout."
"Gunther";"Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up."
"Joey";"Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m headingup there."
"Ross";"Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man."
"Joey";"Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there."
"Rachel";"No."
"Monica";"No, thank you."
"Joey";"(to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, ‘cause I’mheading up there."
"Woman";"I’d love an ice water."
"Joey";"You got it."
"Monica";"Joey, what are you doing?"
"Joey";"Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a ‘what’s wrong withyou?’ look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)"
"Rachel";"Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there."
"Joey";"Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if they’re inon a secret together.)"
"Gunther";"Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron."
"Joey";"Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put onaprons."
"Monica";"Joey, do you work here?"
"Joey";"No."
"Customer";"Hey, waiter."
"Joey";"Yeah?"
"Monica";"Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?"
"Joey";"It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor andnow I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction."
"Chandler";"So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape."
"Joey";"I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guessI’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? Ijust feel kind of weird serving you guys."
"Rachel";"Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine."
"Ross";"Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?"
"Joey";"Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird."
"Ross";"Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it."
"Joey";"See, now it’s weird again."
"Chandler";"I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to makea lot of money, and here’s your first tip: Don’t eat yellow snow. (He laughs,then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2:15,coffeehouse."
"Rachel";"Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can passon my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at thecoffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a longway. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin."
"Joey";"Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, howabout clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover."
"Ross";"Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?"
"Joey";"Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since Imade you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin."
"Rachel";"Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second."
"Phoebe";"Okay."
"Monica";"So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a littlebit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?"
"Rachel";"Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky."
"Monica";"Hah!"
"Phoebe";"That true, I am flaky."
"Rachel";"So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, totally."
"Monica";"Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance."
"Rachel";"Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover."
"Phoebe";"That’s great. Good for you guys."
"Monica";"I am not high maintenance!"
"Rachel";"I am not a pushover!"
"Phoebe";"Who said you were?"
"Monica and Rachel";"You did!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything."
"Joey";"Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition."
"Gunther";"No, I’m leaving to get my hair dyed."
"Joey";"Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part.Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in thisbar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’"
"Gunther";"That’s the whole part?"
"Joey";"Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but …"
"Gunther";"Okay, I’ll see you in an hour."
"Joey";"Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat istaken.’"
"Patron";"Oh, excuse me."
"Joey";"No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?"
"Patron";"I believed you were saving this seat for someone."
"Joey";"So, you’d hire me, right?"
"Patron";"For what?"
"Joey";"Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to beclosed for about an hour."
"Joey";"Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a veryimportant issue in this month’s"
"Ross";"It’s my joke."
"Chandler";"It’s my joke."
"Ross and Chandler";"It’s my joke."
"Ross";"Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this."
"Chandler";"Let’s have Monica decide."
"Ross";"Yeah!"
"Chandler";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"Hey Mon."
"Chandler";"Mon, get out here!"
"Ross";"Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)"
"Chandler";"Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is."
"Monica";"Why do I have to decide?"
"Chandler";"Because you’re the only one that can be fair."
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Monica";"I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend."
"Ross";"Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the mostimportant thing in the world."
"Chandler";"(to Ross) Don’t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I’myour only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go."
"Ross";"We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decidewhich one of us is telling the truth—me."
"Monica";"Okay, Chandler, you go first."
"Chandler";"Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve."
"Monica";"Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?"
"Chandler";"Can I finish my story?!"
"Ross";"See, I would never snap at you like that."
"Monica";"Continue."
"Chandler";"So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’sdoctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is howthe whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize hispoint.)"
"Ross";"Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution?Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!"
"Chandler";"I’m not arguing with that."
"Monica";"All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision."
"Monica";"You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive towomen, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, youshould be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!Now let it go! The joke sucks!"
"Ross";"It’s your joke."
"Chandler";"Is not."
"Monica";"Hi, Chandler. There you are."
"Chandler";"Hi, oh hi."
"Monica";"Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them whatyou were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?"
"Chandler";"(starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient,together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may beperceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(He falters andMonica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit."
"Rachel";"Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve everheard."
"Phoebe";"Really? I’ve heard better."
"Monica";"Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler."
"Chandler";"(To Chandler) I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thingagain?"
"Monica";"Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!"
"Chandler";"(pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You’re a littlehigh maintenance."
"Monica";"Ahhh!"
"Chandler";"I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’repassionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I thinkthat I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s goodtoo. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because Ilike … maintaining you."
"Monica";"(embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn’t even tell him to saythat. (They hug). All right you’re off my list."
"Chandler";"(happily) I’m off the list. (Sits on the couch.)"
"Monica";"(sits next to him) Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me tobe your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend."
"Chandler";"Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?"
"Joey";"Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so…"
"Phoebe";"Wow! That is a bad audition."
"Rachel";"How-how did you lose your job here?"
"Joey";"Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be incharge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me."
"Rachel";"He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and leftyou in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’snot right."
"Joey";"Yeah, what are ya gonna do?"
"Rachel";"Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’mnot going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, Ireally shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him. (Goes to thecounter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that youhave to fire him…"
"Gunther";"Okay."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Gunther";"He can have his job back."
"Rachel";"That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got thatall straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back."
"Joey";"That’s great. Thanks Rach."
"Rachel";"Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?"
"Phoebe";"(returning from the bathroom) Rach, you’re in my seat."
"Rachel";"Oh, I’m sorry. (Gets up and moves.)"
"Phoebe";"Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend."
"Rachel";"Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, well, I kinda thought."
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of theother two guys to go out with, who would you pick?"
"Ross";"No way."
"Joey";"I’m not answering that."
"Chandler";"Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I’m not answeringthat."
"Joey";"Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75.Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all togetherthat’s (pauses to figure the total) $12.75."
"Chandler";"This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phonebill in half."
"Woman";"Hi!"
"Joey";"Hi!"
"Woman";"How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?"
"Joey";"Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani."
"Woman";"Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such anice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?"
"Joey";"Well, he’s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, Igood check with him—He says it’s okay. (She hands him her card.) Great! Thanks!Bye-bye!"
"Ross";"Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn’t free?"
"Joey";"It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great!I’m getting more dates than ever!"
"Rachel";"Wait a minute, you’re only giving free stuff away to the prettygirls?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah Joey that is so gross!"
"Joey";"How about a scone on the house baby?"
"Phoebe";"(giggles) I’m pretty."
"Ross";"Hey does anyone have any gum?"
"Phoebe";"Oh I do! (She grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it andtaking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) Oh, y’know what? No.(Pause) Wait a second. (She removes a bag filled with water that has a goldfish swimmingin it.) I know it’s in here somewhere."
"Ross";"Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good!"
"Monica";"(entering) Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?"
"Monica";"(congested) Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can’t work ifI’m sick."
"Chandler";"I’m so sorry you’re sick."
"Monica";"I’m not sick!! I don’t get sick! Getting sick is for weaklingsand for pansies!"
"Rachel";"Honey, no one thinks you’re a pansy, but we do think you need atissue. (She notices something hanging from Monica’s nose, as does Joey.)"
"Monica";"(wiping her nose) I have not been sick in over three years! (Sneezes.)"
"Chandler";"I’m gonna grab you some tissue."
"Monica";"I don’t need a tissue! I’m fine-d!"
"Ross";"When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’renot fine."
"Monica";"I’m fine-d. I’m fine-d! Y’know, it’s a really hardword to say."
"Chandler";"Yes?"
"Woman";"Hi, is Rachel here? I’m her sister."
"Rachel";"Oh my God, Jill!"
"Jill";"Oh my God, Rachel!"
"Chandler";"Oh my God, introduce us!"
"Rachel";"This is Chandler. (Points at him.)"
"Jill";"Hi!"
"Rachel";"And you know Monica and Ross!"
"Ross";"Hi Jill."
"Rachel";"And that’s Phoebe (points), and that’s Joey."
"Joey";"Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin’?"
"Rachel";"Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.) (To Jill) Honey, what are youdoing here?!"
"Phoebe";"(To Ross) Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one orthat’s bitter?"
"Jill";"(To Rachel) Daddy cut me off."
"Phoebe";"Never mind, I got it."
"Jill";"And y’know what I said to him? "I’m gonna hire a lawyer andI’m gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I’m gonna cut you off!""
"Rachel";"Wow! What did he say?"
"Jill";"That he wouldn’t pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here andlearn about the value of money from the one daughter he’s actually proud off."
"Rachel";"Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proudof me."
"Monica";"Rach? (Points to Jill.)"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut youoff?"
"Jill";"Okay, I bought a boat."
"Monica";"You bought a boat?"
"Jill";"Yeah but it wasn’t for me, it was for a friend."
"Chandler";"Boy did"
"Rachel";"Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could’ve everhappened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I didit, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad isproud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get ajob, you’re gonna get an apartment, and then I’ll help you and you can stay withus. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?"
"Phoebe";"Of course, yeah!"
"Jill";"Oh, that’s so great! Okay, I’m really gonna do this! Idon’t know how to thank you guys."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, I like cards."
"Joey";"(to a customer) Are you all finished here?"
"Joey";"Great! (Joey takes his cookie and finishes it.)"
"Gunther";"Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, andJoey owes eight dollars."
"Joey";"What?!"
"Gunther";"For all the free food you gave away."
"Joey";"Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it?"
"Gunther";"We don’t give anything away unless it’s someone’sbirthday."
"Joey";"Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?"
"Gunther";"No!"
"Joey";"(to a woman who came in third in a modeling contest) Sorry! (He grabs hermuffin away and returns it to the serving tray.)"
"Jill";"(entering, carrying a bunch of shopping bags) I just had the hardest day.Those bags are so heavy. (Sets them down.)"
"Ross";"Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away yourcredit card."
"Jill";"Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all thecool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! (Holds up a red sweater) This is my "Please, hireme" sweater. (Holds up a pair of black pants) And these are my, "Don’t youwant to rent me this apartment?" pants."
"Ross";"I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as makingit on your own."
"Jill";"Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!"
"Phoebe";"Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea."
"Jill";"So who made her queen of the world?"
"Phoebe";"I would"
"Rachel";"(entering) Hey! What’s goin’ on?"
"Jill";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"(notices Jill’s bags) Jill! Did you shop?!"
"Jill";"No! They did! (Points to Phoebe and Ross)"
"Phoebe and Ross";"Yeah, we went shopping!"
"Rachel";"You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded itright under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow, you guys areterrible!"
"Phoebe";"Sorry Jill."
"Ross";"Sorry-sorry Jill."
"Rachel";"What’d you get?"
"Phoebe";"Oh well, all right, I got (Ross hands her a bag) (To Ross) thank you, Igot uh, this y’know "I want a job sweater." (Holds up the same sweater.)"
"Rachel";"Oh."
"Phoebe";"And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants."
"Rachel";"Apartment pants?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, you never heard of them?"
"Rachel";"No, of course, of course I’ve heard of them! Ross, what did youget?"
"Ross";"Huh? Oh, I got this—(Holds up this pink frilly thing)—this!"
"Rachel";"A pajmena?"
"Ross";"Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!"
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Ross";"Ross, wants a pajmena?"
"Ross";"It’s a rug. (Jill winces.)"
"Rachel";"Jill?"
"Jill";"(covers her eyes and starts crying) I’m sorry Rachel, I’msorry…"
"Rachel";"Oh, come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that!"
"Jill";"Right! But, I"
"Rachel";"All right, it’s okay. One little setback is okay, just don’tlet it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I"
"Jill";"She took all my stuff."
"Ross";"Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)"
"Jill";"(gasps) That’s the best one! Oh my God, (hugs him) thank you so much!"
"Ross";"Well. Hey…"
"Jill";"Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!"
"Ross";"Oh yeah, how about you and the, (mimics her fake cry) "I’msorry!""
"Jill";"(hits him) Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!"
"Phoebe";"What about, what about when I said y’know about the apartmentpants, how dumb was I?"
"Jill";"Were you this cute in high school?"
"Ross";"Oh stop."
"Jill";"No you stop!"
"Ross";"No, you stop!"
"Jill";"You stop!"
"Phoebe";"(gets up and sits between them) Okay-okay, why don’t I sit here andyou’ll both stop it!"
"Monica";"Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let’s do somethingcrazy!"
"Chandler";"I know, let’s rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass oforange juice.)"
"Monica";"Okay, I’ll rest. But y’know if I’m going to bed, thenyou’re coming with me."
"Chandler";"That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippyhere. (Points to his nose.)"
"Monica";"(wiping her nose) Are you saying that you don’t wanna get withthis? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesn’t work all that well with thebig robe.)"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy."
"Monica";"(in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.)"
"Chandler";"Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I justcan’t have sex with a sick person."
"Monica";"I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sickperson either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. Weare two healthy people in the pribe of libe."
"Chandler";"That’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe ofmwha-ah-libe."
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey."
"Rachel";"What’s up?!"
"Phoebe";"Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know."
"Rachel";"Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I justpitched the idea to my boss at"
"Phoebe";"No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after youleft and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them."
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn youthat there might be something there."
"Rachel";"With Ross and Jill?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah!"
"Rachel";"With Ross and my sister?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Oh there is no way."
"Phoebe";"Okay then."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like itwhen Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?!Oh my God, and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh thisis just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—Idon’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is thatshe wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister,this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened tome."
"Phoebe";"But"
"Joey";"That’ll be $3.85."
"Woman";"What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!"
"Joey";"It’s just I can’t because my manager said I… (Gets an idea)(Starts singing) "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dearAnnie…"
"Woman";"Amy!"
"Joey";"(still singing) "…Amy! Happy birthday to you!""
"A Male Customer";"Hey, that’s weird, today’s my birthday too!"
"Joey";"Yeah, not it here it isn’t."
"Jill";"(entering) Sorry I’m late, what’s up?"
"Rachel";"(on the couch) Oh hi! Y’know, I just wanted to see if there wereany leads on the old job front."
"Jill";"Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn’t go in. Howstrong am I?"
"Rachel";"That is great. Hey, y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross.He works at the university."
"Jill";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, soyou think you’re gonna go out?"
"Jill";"Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?"
"Rachel";"I just, Phoebe, said y’know thought she saw something between youguys."
"Jill";"No! I mean he’s nice."
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Jill";"He’s the kind of guy you’re friends with, y’know? Buthe’s not the kind of guy you date. He’s the kind of guy"
"Rachel";"Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is theresomething wrong with Ross?"
"Jill";"Oh no-no-no, he’s just I don’t know, he’s just a littlebookish."
"Rachel";"Are-are you saying he’s a geek?"
"Jill";"You think so too?"
"Rachel";"No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!"
"Jill";"Fine, then let’s just say he’s not my type."
"Rachel";"What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What thosethings aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!"
"Jill";"Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I’ll ask him out."
"Rachel";"Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that’s not what I meant."
"Jill";"No! Y’know what Rachel? You’re right, y’know he has beenreally nice to me."
"Rachel";"Yeah but, he’s not your type."
"Jill";"Yeah but maybe that’s a good thing. Y’know I’m doing allthese different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!"
"Rachel";"Yeah but, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t want to try tomuch too fast. Y’know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl thattried to much too fast don’t you?"
"Jill";"What?"
"Rachel";"She-she died Jill."

"The Fan";"No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and Igot her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren’t gonna believe this!(Exits.)"
"Joey";"Hey Gunther, don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just saidPhoebe’s a porn star!"
"Gunther";"Well, I wouldn’t call her a star, but she’s really good. Youshould check out Inspecther Gadget."
"Jill";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Jill";"You’ll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew meoff and he didn’t even tell me why!"
"Rachel";"Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over aguy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at worknamed Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources."
"Jill";"Y’know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not gonna datesome random guy from your work."
"Rachel";"It’s not random, it’s Bob."
"Jill";"It’s probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe hedoesn’t like the way I dress—No that can’t be it. It’s really gotta bethe smart thing. Oh I’m"
"Rachel";"No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? BecauseI asked him to."
"Jill";"You asked him too?!"
"Rachel";"Hm-mmm."
"Jill";"Why?!"
"Rachel";"Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…"
"Jill";"I don’t understand, do you want to go out with Ross?"
"Rachel";"No."
"Jill";"You don’t want him, but you don’t want me to have him?"
"Rachel";"(changing the subject) Y’know Bob in Human Resources…"
"Jill";"Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart Iwas! (Gasps) You had me doubting my fashion sense!"
"Rachel";"Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross!There’s a million other guys out there, you just…"
"Jill";"Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do."
"Rachel";"I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what"
"Jill";"Why are you so jealous of me?"
"Rachel";"Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you beinga brat! Wanting what you can’t have!"
"Jill";"Can’t have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can’t have is"
"Rachel";"All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!"
"Jill";"Who?!"
"Rachel";"…I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! PrincessCaroline?!"
"Monica";"You’re jealous of Princess Caroline?"
"Rachel";"Do I have my own castle?"
"Ross";"Hey! Uh, Phoebe’s not here is she?"
"Rachel";"No."
"Monica";"(noticing the bag Joey’s carrying) Oh great! Did you get a movie?"
"Joey";"Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don’t think it’s the kindyou’re gonna like."
"Chandler";"You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching forthe tissues all night did you?"
"Joey";"Sort of…"
"Monica";"Guys, what’s going on?"
"Joey";"(holds up the movie) Phoebe’s a porn star!"
"All";"What?!!"
"Chandler";"Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer."
"Rachel";"Oh my God!"
"Monica";"That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that?"
"Joey";"Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker."
"Ross";"And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead ofhim to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there. (Theyall kinda look at him.)"
"Rachel";"Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this.Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always beensomewhat of a question mark."
"Monica";"This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know shehad such a terrible childhood."
"Chandler";"Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn."
"Monica";"Yes, but you are dead inside."
"Joey";"All right well, I’d better take that back."
"Monica";"Wh-what, why?"
"Joey";"We can’t watch that! I mean that’s Phoebe!"
"Monica";"Yeah you’re right, we can’t—we shouldn’t watch this."
"Rachel";"Absolutely not."
"Monica";"(hands the tape back to Joey, but doesn’t let him grab it)Y’know maybe a little bit!"
"Rachel";"Probably just the first half."
"Joey";"No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well,I’m not gonna watch it!"
"Ross";"Yeah! Good for you Joe!"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Buffay, the Vampire Layer";"Ah, I thought I’d find you here, Nasforatool."
"The Vampire";"Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?"
"Buffay, the Vampire Layer";"Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the otherway around."
"Monica";"Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?"
"Chandler";"Her ankle is what you’re watching?"
"Rachel";"Well it’s hard to tell… (Rachel gets up to get a closer look,only she’s having some trouble.) Oh God, if she would just stop moving."
"Chandler";"She’s just doing her job!"
"Joey";"(sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the TV) You sick bastards!"
"Rachel";"Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t…Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!"
"Joey";"Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey! What’s up? (Sees the TV) Oh my God! What am Idoing?!!"
"Monica";"Hey sweetie!"
"Chandler";"Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under thecouch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)"
"Monica";"(picking up the book)"
"Chandler";"There’s no back to this couch!"
"Monica";"Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff."
"Chandler";"Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of thosestories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all deadinside."
"Monica";"Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if youcan’t cry, I love you."
"Chandler";"Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest."
"Monica";"Stop it!"
"Chandler";"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married,we’re up at the altar and I’m like this. (Makes a bored face.)"
"Monica";"I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.(Points to her heart.)"
"Chandler";"Yeah?"
"Monica";"Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it toyou in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take himto college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing,it won’t matter to me."
"Chandler";"Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then."
"Monica";"And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing outmy eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I willalways be with you," and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’llbe crying a river inside."
"Chandler";"Aww, I love you so…"
"Monica";"What is wrong with you?!!!"
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Monica";"What?! You can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you anote from the beyond!"
"Chandler";"So you didn’t mean any of that?!"
"Monica";"No you robot!!"
"Ross";"You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to… (Opens thedoor to find Jill standing there.) Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that’s just a little gameI play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they’ve really taken a liking to me.(Quickly looks out to see if they’re watching.) Uhhwhat’s-what’s-what’s the matter?"
"Jill";"Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I knowwe’re not supposed to see each other anymore and I’m okay with that, it’sjust that I don’t know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk toabout it."
"Ross";"Of course, what happened? (Lets her in.)"
"Jill";"(entering) I don’t want to talk about it."
"Ross";"Okay, umm…"
"Jill";"But you know what might really cheer me up?"
"Ross";"What?"
"Jill";"Seeing some more of your super-cool slides."
"Ross";"Wow! Really?!"
"Jill";"Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all thedifferent kinds of sand."
"Ross";"Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get theprojector and my notes!"
"Jill";"Oh great! Thanks Ross, you’re such a good friend!"
"Ross";"Ohh!"
"Rachel";"Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere."
"Monica";"No, I haven’t."
"Rachel";"Well, is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’sactually seen her."
"Ursula";"Who is it?"
"Phoebe";"It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!"
"Ursula";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"(seeing her dress) Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies."
"Ursula";"No I’m not."
"Phoebe";"You’re making one right now!"
"Phoebe";"And-"
"Ursula";"Yeah, can I help you with something?"
"Phoebe";"Look, I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her."
"Ursula";"Y’know, twin stuff is always a real big seller."
"Phoebe";"What?!"
"Ursula";"Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars."
"Phoebe";"No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! (Yells intothe apartment) And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you (points tosomeone) with that! (Storms away.)"
"Ross";"Slides are almost ready."
"Jill";"Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!"
"Ross";"Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen."
"Jill";"Oh great! (Goes to get it as the phone rings.)"
"Ross";"(answering it) Hello?"
"Rachel";"(on phone)"
"Ross";"O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’rejust talking."
"Rachel";"Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to getback at me!"
"Ross";"So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’thave anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I puton a"
"Rachel";"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!"
"Ross";"Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to youlater. Good-bye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.)Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me."
"Jill";"So? (Kisses him passionately.)"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"So, I just came from the company Ursula works for."
"Joey";"Oh no, not you too!"
"Phoebe";"No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were alot of them."
"Joey";"Nice!"
"Phoebe";"Um-mmm,"
"Joey";"That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still thinkyou’re a porn star?"
"Phoebe";"Oh no! No! I know how to handle it."
"Joey";"You do?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah. (She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is tryingto remember where he’s seen her before.) (To him) You’re trying to figure outwhere you know me from? All right, I’ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? (He triesto rush his girlfriend out.) Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (ToJoey) See?"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Ross";"(To Rachel) You uh, you may have been right about Jill."
"Rachel";"Oh! I knew it! What happened?"
"Ross";"Umm, she kissed me."
"Rachel";"What?! You kissed!"
"Chandler";"(To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy."
"Monica";"(To Chandler) Shhhh!!!"
"Ross";"Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?"
"Rachel";"Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy notto kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!"
"Ross";"Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it.I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…"
"Rachel";"Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Letme give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)"
"Ross";"Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped thekissing."
"Rachel";"Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouthlong enough to tell me that."
"Ross";"Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothingcould ever happen with us!"
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Ross";"No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us,again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and shegot mad and broke my projector."
"Rachel";"Wow. I, I don’t even know what to say. Thank you. (Gently kickshim.)"
"Ross";"You’re welcome. (Gently kicks her back.)"
"Monica";"Oh my God! Are-are you crying?"
"Chandler";"(crying hysterically) I just don’t see why those two can’twork things out!"
"Jill";"All right, I’m leaving! Because I’m not going to spend one moreday with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That’s you Rachel!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I got that."
"Jill";"(To Ross) And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?"
"Ross";"You take care Jill."
"Jill";"(happily) Okay, see ya! (Exits.)"
"Rachel";"Bye-bye-e!"
"Monica";"Bye."
"Chandler";"(starts crying) I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone. (They alllook at him.) I can’t help it, I opened a gate."
"Rachel";"Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!"
"Monica";"Oh my God!"
"Phoebe";"Wow!"
"Joey";"(To Ross)"
"Phoebe";"No! Barry and Mindy."
"Joey";"Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. (To Rachel)Who-who’s Barry and Mindy?"
"Rachel";"Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my bestfriend."
"Joey";"Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of herinstead of me."
"Monica";"Why did they get divorced?"
"Rachel";"Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else.Isn’t that sad? (Giggles.) God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I meanhow different would my life be?"
"Ross";"I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my lifewould be if-if I’d never gotten divorced."
"Phoebe";"Which time?"
"Ross";"The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized shewas a lesbian."
"Joey";"(starts to imagine it) I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way."
"Ross";"I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay. (That’s karate,he’s just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot ofkara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything elsephysical."
"Chandler";"Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay."
"Monica";"And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldn’t bedating me, that’s for sure."
"Chandler";"Sure I would!"
"Chandler";"What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow?"
"Ross";"No, I just think Monica was that fat."
"Joey";"Hey, imagine if I never got fired off"
"Chandler";"What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably bewriting for the"
"Phoebe";"What if I had taken that job at"
"Ross";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had aknack for stocks."
"Rachel";"Well why didn’t you take the job?"

"Monica";"Sorry. So how’s it going with Joey?"
"Chandler";"Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring mefood." Two is, "I’m with a girl, bring us food." Three is,"I’m lost and I can’t find food.""
"Joey";"(entering) Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?"
"Monica";"Yeah! She’s right in there! (Points to Phoebe’s room.)"
"Joey";"Oh great. (Starts to go in.) (To Chandler) Hey! Go take off those pants,they look ready!"

"Chandler";"I’m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp."
"Joey";"Oh my God, I’m sorry, I’m being so rude. (Turns to Rachel.)Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it."
"Rachel";"Yeah sure, iced tea would be great."
"Joey";"(To Chandler) Iced tea."

"Ross";"Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that youshould start think about getting a different job."
"Phoebe";"Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!(Points at Ross.)"
"Chandler";"Listen Phoebe, he’s right. People are not supposed to have heartattacks at 31."
"Phoebe";"I know! But if I didn’t work there, what else would I do?"
"Monica";"Well, you used to like playing the guitar."
"Phoebe";"Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!"

"Rachel";"Ohh, I mean it’s just so realistic!"
"Joey";"I know. (Joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls onpolls. You’ll have to see it to know what I mean.) Yeah, his name is Pat."
"Rachel";"Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.)"
"Joey";"(climbing down from his chair) Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?"
"Rachel";"Oh, I probably shouldn’t—so I will! (Joey starts making herrefill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.) Oh! Wow! It’s like it’sraining!"
"Joey";"Pretty cool, huh? But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in thereand it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong."
"Rachel";"Umm, can I use your bathroom?"
"Joey";"It’s uh, right through there. (Points.)"
"Rachel";"Okay. (Starts to go.) God y’know, if someone told me a week agothat I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment…"
"Joey";"Yeah, life’s pretty great isn’t it?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, it sure is!"
"Monica";"I hope you’re hungry, we’re starting with oysters. Andy’know what they say about oysters, don’t you?"
"Dr. Roger";"They have parasites?"
"Monica";"No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac."
"Dr. Roger";"What people?"
"Monica";"People! People say it! Come here! (She grabs him and kisses him.)"
"Dr. Roger";"So oysters, huh?"
"Monica";"And then we’re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous.Something we can eat, with our hands."
"Dr. Roger";"Y’know, it’s funny, but when we were studying communicablediseases…"
"Monica";"No-no-no, no! It’s sensual!"
"Dr. Roger";"Ohh! Didn’t know! Okay!"
"Monica";"Okay! (They kiss again and his beeper goes off.) Ohhh no!"
"Dr. Roger";"I’m sorry sweetie, it’s the hospital. The food looks great,maybe save me some?"
"Monica";"I can’t promise anything. (She starts to dig in.)"
"Ross";"We’re really gonna do this, huh?"
"Carol";"Looks like it."
"Ross";"Y’know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back outat… (A knock on the door interrupts him.)"
"Carol";"(jumping up to get it) I got it!"
"Ross";"Okay."
"Carol";"(opening the door) Susan! Hi! (Who’d you think it was gonna be?)"
"Susan";"Hey! (They hug.)"
"Carol";"Thank you so much for coming."
"Susan";"Oh, I wouldn’t miss it for the world."
"Ross";"I’m-I’m Ross by the way."
"Susan";"(not taking her eyes off Carol) Hello Ross. (Takes off her coat and handsit to him.) I love what you’ve done with this space."
"Carol";"Thank you so much."
"Ross";"How hot is this?!"
"Chandler";"I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger."
"Monica";"Yeah, me too."
"Chandler";"Well, I could make it seem like he’s here. (Imitates him.)"Here’s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn’t add the secondcous until 1979." (Mumbles something further.)"
"Monica";"Stop it!! That’s not funny!!"
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Monica";"I’m sorry, okay? It just—tonight was supposed to bey’know, it was supposed to be a big deal."
"Chandler";"What was tonight?"
"Monica";"You don’t want to know what tonight was."
"Chandler";"Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?"
"Monica";"Well, tonight was—was going to be my first time."
"Chandler";"With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monicashrugs.) Oh my God!"
"Monica";"All right relax Mr. I’ve Had Sex Four Times!"
"Chandler";"Four different women! I’ve had sex way more times!"
"Monica";"How many?"
"Chandler";"Nine."
"Monica";"I was just waiting for the perfect guy."
"Chandler";"Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfectguy?"
"Monica";"No. He’s not a horrible guy."
"Chandler";"Hey that’s what I tell girls about me."
"Monica";"Chandler, I’m gonna die a virgin!"
"Chandler";"No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happenfor you."
"Monica";"Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?"
"Chandler";"Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)"
"Monica";"I was kidding."
"Chandler";"So was I."
"Rachel";"Joey, you’re such an amazing actor! (He smiles.) How do you knowwhere Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?"
"Joey";"Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, Ipretty much have to make it up on my own."
"Rachel";"Wow! Tell me something Joey—(She falls off the couch)—Whoa! Ijust fell right off the couch there."
"Joey";"Yeah you did."
"Rachel";"Okay. (She climbs back onto the couch.)"
"Joey";"Here you go. Let me ask you a question."
"Rachel";"Yeah?"
"Joey";"When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?"
"Rachel";"Wow! I can’t, I can’t feel my hands."
"Joey";"Come, come here."
"Chandler";"We can’t do this."
"Monica";"No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?"
"Chandler";"Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot ofpressure on me, y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and Iwouldn’t want to disappoint you."
"Monica";"Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you’rehorrible, how would I know?"
"Chandler";"I do like that."
"Monica";"It’s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!"
"Chandler";"Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be fortonight, right?"
"Monica";"Absolutely! It would just be one friend (Points at Chandler) helping outanother friend. (Points at herself.)"
"Chandler";"Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!"
"Monica";"Noo!! Okay!!"
"Chandler";"Okay! (They both get up.)"
"Monica";"Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?"
"Chandler";"I have some moves."
"Monica";"I have no moves. (He moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backsaway.) Okay, whatcha doin’ there?! (Giggles.) Oh y’know what? I’m sorry,this is just too weird."
"Chandler";"Yeah, let’s just forget it."
"Monica";"What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.)"
"Chandler";"Okay!"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah."
"Monica";"Chandler?"
"Chandler";"(sexily) Yeah?"
"Monica";"That’s the couch."

"Rachel";"No! No-no-no…"
"Joey";"Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that"

"Joey";"Look, do you want the ring or not?!"
"Rachel";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Look at you! You’re up!"

"Rachel";"Good day for married people huh?"
"Ross";"I’m sorry your husband cheated on you."
"Rachel";"I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that greateither."
"Ross";"Try telling my wife that."
"Chandler";"(sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?"
"Monica";"Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again."
"Chandler";"Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?"
"Monica";"What?!"
"Chandler";"I’m the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.)"
"Monica";"Why would you do that?"
"Chandler";"Because you shouldn’t be with him. (Pause.) You should be withme."
"Monica";"Really?"
"Chandler";"Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look,things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me. Orwith the other two women, in the morning y’know I was just lying there and Icouldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y’knowwith a friend."
"Monica";"Chandler!"
"Chandler";"I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’knowbecause I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and Iguess I’m not technically a "doctor…""
"Monica";"There was just one woman, wasn’t there?"
"Chandler";"No, there were two."
"Monica";"Including me?"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah."
"Phoebe";"(singing)"
"Ross";"Hey, remember when I had a monkey?"
"Chandler";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Yeah, what, what was I thinking?"
"Joey";"(he’s just picked up their bill) Hey! So, what’s with the 20percent tip? Did I do something wrong?"
"Chandler";"Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe."
"Joey";"Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent!Y’know what’s even more generous than that?!!"
"Chandler";"I see where you’re goin’!"
"Ross";"What’s up with the greed Joe?"
"Joey";"All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gottaget these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’mdown to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened insome teeth—Why did I do that?! (Hits himself in the head.)"
"Ross";"Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? Imean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here?"
"Phoebe";"Or, y’know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps ifyou’ve got y’know a little of this (she sticks her chest out and shakes it)goin’ on. Wow! I still have it!"
"Ross";"Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybeyou’ll get that job!"
"Joey";"Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments downon me all the time!"
"Chandler";"(reminiscing) Ah, finally an explanation."
"Joey";"No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again. (To Ross) I really preferdoing that at the home office y’know? (Ross nods his head.) Ooh-ooh, maybe they wantlike some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?"
"Gunther";"(approaching with a tray with an order on it) Joey!"
"Joey";"Yeah?"
"Gunther";"What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you’reworking?"
"Joey";"Uhh do it?"
"Gunther";"That guy (points) has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes!He’s complained about you three times! (He hands the coffee cup to Joey, assumingthat Joey will deliver it and walks away.)"
"Joey";"Well, where was I? (Takes a sip of the coffee.)"
"Ross";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey, what have you guys been up to?"
"Phoebe";"Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!"
"Ross";"Wow!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!"
"Joey";"Takes it out of you? (Laughs.)"
"Phoebe";"Now, we can kick anybody’s ass!"
"Rachel";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"After one class? I don’t think so."
"Rachel";"What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there (points) andpretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!"
"Ross";"Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming,that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s aconcept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call (he holds twofingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) unagi."
"Rachel";"Isn’t that a kind of sushi?"
"Ross";"No, it’s a concept!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!"
"Ross";"All right, maybe it means that too…"
"Rachel";"Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!"
"Ross";"Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care!"
"Phoebe";"(deadpan) Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is."
"Ross";"Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagican you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!"
"Phoebe";"You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat oryour kettle of fish?"
"Ross";"(moves closer) All I’m saying is, it’s one thing being preparedfor an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, Idon’t know, like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachel’s and screams)"
"Ross";"All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean youhave unagi. (Does the finger thing.)"
"Rachel";"(To Phoebe) Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we couldhave unagi in about a half-hour."
"Ross";"Y’know what… (Moves away as Chandler enters, panicked.)"
"Chandler";"Hey-hey, is Monica here?"
"Phoebe";"No."
"Ross";"No."
"Chandler";"Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her forValentine’s Day."
"Rachel";"Well, Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn’tget her a calendar!"
"Chandler";"(laughs) She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’recelebrating it tonight."
"Joey";"Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of thoseromantic spas?"
"Phoebe";"Ooh, Joey, that’s actually a really good idea!"
"Joey";"And of course, crotchless panties."
"Chandler";"Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and herbrother, (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) Ican’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year."
"Rachel";"Aw, I love that."
"Phoebe";"You guys!"
"Joey";"You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair ofscissors and you just cut…"
"Rachel";"(interrupting him) Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds likeso much fun."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?"
"Chandler";"I made a… (Does one of those gibberish words.)"
"Phoebe";"What is that?"
"Chandler";"Nothing!"
"Ross";"So what are you gonna do?"
"Chandler";"Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?"
"Phoebe";"Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! (Shetakes out a sock that’s been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, andtwo other socks sown onto it for ears.) Oh for crying out loud!"
"Rachel";"Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!"
"Phoebe";"Now, it’s you little bunny friend. (She sticks it in Rachel’sface and they both laugh.)"
"Chandler";"(admiring his work) This, this actually is a… (Does the samegibberish word from before.)"
"Monica";"(entering) Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Daygifts?"
"Monica";"Oh, yeah."
"Chandler";"Do we have to make the entire thing?"
"Monica";"Yes! Why, did you—you forget to make yours?"
"Chandler";"Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the placewhere I-I made it and pick-pick it up."
"Monica";"Okay. (They kiss.) Okay, I can’t wait! This is going to be the bestValentine’s Day ever! (Chandler giggles and exits.) I can’t believe it! Make thepresents! Make the presents!"
"Chandler";"(sticking his head back in) What?"
"Monica";"I’m just so excited to make the presents! (Chandler does anothersarcastic/scared laugh and leaves.) Shoot!"
"Joey";"(to the receptionist) Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all dorespect I’d like to donate some fluids."
"Receptionist";"We’re actually at the end of one of our research cycles, sowe’re not looking for applicants right now."
"Joey";"Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up. (She just looks athim in horror.) Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?"
"Receptionist";"Well, here’s a schedule of what’s coming up. (Hands itto him.)"
"Joey";"Thanks. (Starts to read it.) Well but this one starts now. (Points toone.)"
"Receptionist";"Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins areeligible. It’s a twins study."
"Joey";"But it’s $2,000."
"Receptionist";"Sorry."
"Joey";"Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani onattractive nurse receptionists."
"Receptionist";"We already got the results back on that on, and they’re notgood. (Joey beats a hasty retreat.)"
"Phoebe";"Ross!!!"
"Rachel";"What the hell was that?!"
"Ross";"A lesson in the importance of unagi. (He starts doing the finger thingevery time now.)"
"Phoebe";"Ohh,"
"Ross";"Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screamswould you have begun to"
"Rachel";"All right, so we weren’t"
"Ross";"I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, butI—look, I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbageand Ross screams…)"
"Joey";"(in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin.Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? (The camera widens its shot toreveal a room full of Joey look-a-likes. Joey looks at the guy next to him and then backat his script.)"
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Ross";"(not turning around) Chandler. I sensed it was you."
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Ross";"Unagi. I’m always aware."
"Chandler";"Okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?"
"Ross";"What’s up?"
"Chandler";"I can’t figure out what to make Monica."
"Ross";"Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes."
"Chandler";"I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here thatlooks homemade?"
"Ross";"Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this. (Picks up a model ofthe Saturn V rocket, that’s the one that took man to the moon.) Uh, it’s anexact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me tothe moon."
"Ross";"Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. Butyou-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and returnsafely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read theChristmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968. They also took thefamous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)"
"Chandler";"Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her."
"Ross";"Why not?"
"Chandler";"Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hateMonica" on the bottom."
"Ross";"Oh."
"Phoebe and Rachel DANGER";"!!!!!"
"Rachel";"Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)"
"Chandler";"Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way,and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Thenhe holds it out as if he’s giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throwsit down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out apair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties hejust removed.) I can’t do it. I can’t do it. (He throws them both down andcontinues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! Amixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)"
"Chandler";"Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?"
"Monica";"Sure! Okay, you go first."
"Chandler";"Okay, come here! Come here."
"Monica";"Okay! (She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on thecouch.)"
"Chandler";"Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it."
"Monica";"Okay."
"Chandler";"But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs."
"Monica";"Oh, what a great gift! Is"
"Chandler";"(momentarily terrified) Maybe we’ll have to listen and see!"
"Monica";"Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!"
"Chandler";"Okay!"
"Monica";"Okay, you ready to open yours?"
"Chandler";"Yeah!"
"Monica";"Okay."
"Chandler";"It’s a sock bunny."
"Monica";"Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?"
"Chandler";"Not really."
"Monica";"Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. Seethat’s what this is about."
"Chandler";"I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies."
"Monica";"No! No, she doesn’t. Uh Phoebe, what she makes—that’suh—they’re sock rabbits. They are completely different—Okay! Okay! Okay! Ididn’t make it! I’m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact thatwe’re supposed to"
"Chandler";"Oh, it’s okay. I don’t…"
"Monica";"No-no, it’s not okay! It’s not! I mean you were just…You’re so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape forme! Y’know I’m just gonna—I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I amgoing to"
"Chandler";"(thinking it over) Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (Theyboth run into the bedroom.)"
"Chandler";"Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.)"
"Monica";"Oops! (Covers its eyes.) Y’know, your birthday is in amonth-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?"
"Chandler";"You are totally and completely 100% forgiven."
"Monica";"We have got to wash that! (Referring to the sock bunny.)"
"Chandler";"Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)"
"Monica";"Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought wastoo expensive?"
"Chandler";"You have done enough!"
"Monica";"I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!"
"Chandler";"No you don’t—get it in black, not brown."
"Monica";"Oop, your cake is ready!"
"Chandler";"Oop!"
"Chandler";"Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake."
"Joey's Look-A-Like";"Hey Mon! Hey Chann! (He goes to the fridge) Justgettin’ a soda! (Does so.)"
"Monica";"Who the hell are you?!"
"Joey's Look-A-Like";"I’m Joey! How are you doin’?!"

"Joey";"Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl."
"Chandler";"Who the hell is Carl?!"
"Joey";"Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for amedical research project."
"Chandler";"Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you,aren’t they?"
"Joey";"Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? Theonly problem is, Carl’s acting is… (Does the international hand symbol forso-so.)"

"Phoebe";"Pat Sajak?"
"Rachel";"Yep!"
"Phoebe";"Alex Trebek?"
"Rachel";"Oh, of course!"
"Phoebe";"Chuck Woolery?"
"Rachel";"Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host,who’s ass I cannot kick."
"Rachel";"Say it!"
"Phoebe";"Say we are unagi!"
"Ross";"It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!"
"Rachel";"Say it!"
"Ross";"Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance youcan get very, very hurt!"
"Joey";"All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?"
"Carl";"Another"
"Joey";"That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?"
"Carl";"Well, I’m not gonna talk because…"

"Monica";"You are just the sweetest. (They kiss.)"
"Janice";"I love the way you look"

"Ross";"It’s a great class."
"The Instructor";"Thanks."
"Ross";"Yeah, yeah, I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.)Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where thewoman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?"

"The Instructor";"What?!"
"Ross";"No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends.In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them."
"The Instructor";"Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!"
"Ross";"Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’mhere. Maybe we could attack them together? (He glares at him.) That-that’s a no."

"Rachel";"Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!"
"Phoebe";"We should help him!"
"Rachel";"I… Well, I don’t think they need any help."
"Ross";"Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this onestudent wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller,you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!""
"Chandler";"Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there’s a bigselling calendar, eh?"
"Rachel";"Who wrote it?"
"Ross";"Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous."
"Joey";"Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Joey";"Oh, ‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with thesame handwriting and boom, there’s your admirer. (Ross is stunned.)"
"Chandler";"A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man."
"Rachel";"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is agirl?"
"Ross";"It’s a girl! Anyway, it wou—it wouldn’t matter. Okay?Because I’m a teacher and"
"Chandler";"Oh, is that against the rules?"
"Ross";"No, but it is frowned upon."
"Chandler";"I see."
"Ross";"Besides, there’s a big age difference."
"Joey";"Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90…"
"Ross";"I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem likesuch a big difference."
"Joey";"No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going tosay is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to bewith a 20-year-old."
"Joey";"Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-whobecame a movie director?"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class."
"Phoebe";"What’s a Movement class?"
"Monica";"It’s Chandler’s way of pretending he didn’t take mime."
"Joey";"Oh well listen, anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. Yougotta get me an audition!"
"Chandler";"Oh, I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like tenyears."
"Joey";"No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you"
"Chandler";"You"
"Joey";"Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make thecall or what?"
"Chandler";"Oh okay, I’ll-I’ll try."
"Joey";"All right! Thanks! You’re the best! Now listen, the last day ofauditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just rememberThursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?"
"Chandler";"Yeah so, Tuesday?"
"Joey";"(angrily) Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this,the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? Whatday? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!"
"Chandler";"(sarcastically) Thank you."
"Joey";"Okay."
"Rachel";"(entering from the bathroom) Hey Mon? I’m gonna check my messages."
"Chandler";"You just thought of that in there?"
"Monica";"Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did."
"Rachel";"(on phone) Hello? (Shocked that someone answered.) Uh, Rachel. (To thegang.) Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!"
"Monica";"You’re on the phone!"
"Rachel";"(on phone) Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! (Hangs up) That was the firedepartment, there was a fire at our place!"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! How bad was it?"
"Rachel";"Well, he didn’t say, but it was a fire. I’m guessing not verygood. Come on, we gotta go!"
"Monica";"Come on! (The girls all run out and Joey holds up Chandler by smiling.)"
"Chandler";"What are you smiling about? What is so funny?"
"Joey";"The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!"
"Burt";"(another professor) Wow! It looks like you were very generous with yourgrades this semester! (Ross frantically starts to change some as a female student,Elizabeth, approaches.)"
"Elizabeth";"Professor Geller?"
"Ross";"(startled) Yeah?"
"Elizabeth";"I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class."
"Ross";"Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on athumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)"
"Elizabeth";"Uh, I’m a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on myevaluation…"
"Ross";"That was you?"
"Elizabeth";"Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You’re a teacher. I’m astudent. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?"
"Ross";"Oh I, I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea."
"Elizabeth";"Oh, because I was thinking, the semester’s over; you’re not myteacher anymore."
"Ross";"What time?"
"Elizabeth";"(checks her grade) Oh, y’know what? Forget it, you already gave mean A."
"Ross";"Gotcha. (Starts to leave.)"
"Elizabeth";"I’m kidding!"
"Ross";"Oh! So-so seriously, what time?"
"Phoebe";"Coming through! (Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees acute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through!"
"Monica";"Oh well, it’s not so bad."
"Fireman #1";"Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms."
"Phoebe";"Oh!"
"Rachel";"My God! (They both run into the bedrooms.)"
"Joey";"(to the fireman) Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform thisThursday?"
"Fireman #1";"Excuse me?"
"Monica";"Joey! He’s working! (To Chandler) You would look"
"Joey";"Oh, how bad is it?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there thatisn’t burned is an ass. Which I do"
"Chandler";"How’s your room Rach?"
"Rachel";"Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite bluesweater. (Hold it up.)"
"Monica";"Isn’t that mine?"
"Rachel";"Fine! I’m sorry for your loss! (Hands it back to her.)"
"Fireman #1";"So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, youladies have a place to stay?"
"Rachel";"(stands up) Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am"
"Monica";"(pulling Rachel back down) Yes, they can stay with us."
"Chandler";"Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?"
"Fireman #1";"Well uh, do either of you smoke?"
"Phoebe";"No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now."
"Fireman #1";"No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?"
"Phoebe";"Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me!It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!"
"Rachel";"Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay? (Tothe fireman) I warned her about those candles."
"Chandler";"God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how longit’s been!"
"Joey";"Chandler, is that… (Mimes someone using a movie camera and Chandlernods yes.)"
"Chandler";"(on phone) Oh that’s great! Good for you."
"Joey";"Hey-hey listen… (Chandler waves him away.)"
"Chandler";"Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm… (Joey mimesthrowing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven andcutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!"
"Joey";"When you’re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?"
"Chandler";"(on phone) Hi! I’m back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, thatsounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well, we’ll do it then. (Listens) Okay, bye-bye. (Hehangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)"
"Joey";"Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I knowit’s Thursday, but what time?"
"Chandler";"Hi."
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"(To Joey) We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take herto coffee and then we’ll do it then."
"Joey";"Ah-ha!"
"Monica";"Wow! So, now you’re going on a date with this girl?"
"Chandler";"Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years!You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask themfor a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time."
"Monica";"You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’rey’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend."
"Chandler";"No, we only went out once."
"Monica";"You dated her!"
"Chandler";"Not once!"
"Monica";"All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joeya favor?!"
"Joey";"Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turnsaround to see Chandler glaring at him.)"
"Chandler";"(laughs) Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the moviebusiness."
"Dana";"Y’know who I ran into from school? Howie."
"Chandler";"(giggles) My friend’s name is Joey."
"Dana";"Apparently Howie’s editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asksme if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y’know I-I-I haven’tspoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie."
"Dana";"No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffeefirst!"
"Chandler";"The nerve huh?"
"Dana";"Yeah!"
"Chandler";"Refill?"
"Monica";"Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?"
"Rachel";"Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here."
"Monica";"I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’sonly room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s."
"Phoebe";"Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you shouldget to stay here."
"Rachel";"Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was anaccident."
"Phoebe";"Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room."
"Rachel";"Okay! (She jumps on the bed.)"
"Monica";"So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you’lljust have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bringthem to you, y’know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much."
"Rachel";"I have."
"Joey";"This right here is where I keep the pizza. (He points to the chair.) Anduh that’s where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.)"
"Phoebe";"What’s that smell?"
"Joey";"I know! (Shrugs his shoulders.)"
"Elizabeth";"Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!"
"Ross";"What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson."
"Elizabeth";"Who?"
"Ross";"Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda cameup with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt."
"Elizabeth";"Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?"
"Ross";"Umm, no. No."
"Elizabeth";"Yes you did! What was it?"
"Ross";"Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty."
"Elizabeth";"Ohh that’s so sweet!"
"Ross";"Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time! Y’know howbefore you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank Ithought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all."
"Burt";"(exiting from a restaurant) Dr. Geller!"
"Ross";"(pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!"
"Phoebe";"So did you sleep well last night?"
"Rachel";"I did."
"Phoebe";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow."
"Phoebe";"Y’know what Joey left on my pillow?"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Gum!"
"Fireman #2";"Well, we determined the cause of the fire."
"Phoebe";"Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!"
"Fireman #2";"No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It’s lookslike a curling iron."
"Phoebe";"I don’t use a curling iron."
"Fireman #2";"Well someone does."
"Rachel";"Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight!Straight! Straight!"
"Fireman #2";"It could’ve been a hair straightener."
"Rachel";"Oh."
"Joey";"This is where I keep the pizza. (It’s the same location as before.)And—Hey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in it’s spot.)"
"Monica";"Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!"
"Phoebe";"Thanks Monica!"
"Monica";"Does that smell bother you?"
"Phoebe";"What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here."
"Monica";"Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie tocover it."
"Phoebe";"I can smell it a little, bake the pie."
"Monica";"Okay!"
"Phoebe";"Okay."
"Monica";"Hello? (Listens) Oh yes, one minute please. (To Phoebe) It’s foryou. It’s the fire inspector."
"Phoebe";"Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens)Really?!"
"Joey";"(in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hairstraightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, itwas the candles. It’s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of thefirst things they teach you in fire school is… (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhh…Uhh… Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)"
"Ross";"We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thoughtthe-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all.Elizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.)(To Monica) A concept lost on some people!"
"Monica";"So it’s okay to date a student."
"Ross";"Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against therules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into lastnight, Judgey von Holierthanthou."
"Monica";"Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputationas y’know Professor McNailshisstudents."
"Ross";"Yeah. What-what should I do?"
"Joey";"Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? Whatpeople think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart."
"Monica";"Joey that is so sweet."
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey."
"Joey";"Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave ablock of time open say Thursday?"
"Chandler";"I couldn’t do it."
"Joey";"You couldn’t do it?!"
"Chandler";"Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight."
"Monica";"What?! You’re going out with her again!"
"Ross";"Going out with who?"
"Chandler";"Uh, Dana Keystone from college."
"Ross";"Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh… (Does the international sign for bigboobies.)"
"Chandler";"No, that was Dana Caplin."
"The Guys";"Ohhhh! (They all look up in a moment of reflection.)"
"Monica";"Joey! You didn’t even know her!"
"Joey";"Ah whatever!"
"Chandler";"Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!"
"Dana";"Y’know uh, actually I-I-I should get going."
"Chandler";"Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you shouldstay!"
"Dana";"Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don’t feel that wayabout you."
"Chandler";"Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!"
"Dana";"I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, Idon’t want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feelbetter."
"Chandler";"No-no—Really?!"
"Dana";"Of course!"
"Chandler";"(breaking up) Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh…"
"Dana";"Ohh, I’m sorry."
"Chandler";"Well maybe there is one thing you can do."
"Dana";"What?! Anything! Anything!"
"Chandler";"Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but Ihave this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing thisumm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say onThursday?"
"Dana";"Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you ifyour actor friend can audition for my movie?"
"Chandler";"Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later. (He runsoff and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)"
"Monica";"Hey! How’s it goin’?"
"Phoebe";"Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes."
"Monica";"Yes it has! I made cookies!"
"Phoebe";"Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potatochips."
"Monica";"But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven."
"Phoebe";"Okay. (Reaches for one.)"
"Monica";"(pulling the plate back) Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘emin bed, remember? No crumbies!"
"Phoebe";"(gritting her teeth) Okay, I’ll be out in a second."
"Monica";"Okay!"
"Monica";"(opening the door) What are you doing?"
"Phoebe";"That doesn’t lock does it?"
"Rachel";"Oh, Joey! Sorry!"
"Joey";"No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it."
"Rachel";"Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!"
"Joey";"Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!"
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Joey";"Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)"
"Rachel";"I’ve never lived like this before."
"Joey";"I know."
"Joey";"All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up andeats it.)"
"Ross";"What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?"
"Elizabeth";"Uhh, I can’t."
"Ross";"Oh, you have some studying to do?"
"Elizabeth";"No, I have some turning 21 to do."
"Ross";"Y’know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to…(He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)"
"Elizabeth";"What are you doing?"
"Ross";"Nothing, I’m-I’m just, I’m so comfortable with you!"
"Elizabeth";"Do you not want to be seen with me?"
"Ross";"What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?"
"Elizabeth";"Uh no, they’re still here but I think I’m about to leave."
"Ross";"What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares whatpeople think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong withthat. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.)Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth."
"Elizabeth";"Hi!"
"Lydia";"Aren’t you in my Popular Culture class?"
"Ross";"That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’redating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore."
"Mel";"You are"
"Ross";"What?"
"Burt";"They’re gonna fire you! You can’t date a student! It’sagainst the rules."
"Ross";"Really? Its not just frowned upon?"
"Rachel";"I love it at Joey’s!"
"Joey";"Hey, here you go. (Hands her another one.)"
"Chandler";"(entering, sees Rachel’s throw) Ni-hi-ice!"
"Rachel";"Thanks!"
"Chandler";"(To Joey) So, you busy Thursday?"
"Joey";"Oh, very funny. I don’t know if you remember, but my audition wassupposed to be Thursday. (Chandler doesn’t say anything until Joey figures it out.)You got me the audition?! Let’s hug it up! (They hug.)"

"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey! Hi!"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"(To Rachel) Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!"
"Rachel";"Uh-huh."
"Phoebe";"Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener startedthe fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tellyou but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s justface it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay atJoey’s."
"Rachel";"No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what?I’m fine here."
"Phoebe";"Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you."
"Chandler";"Really?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah she said something about crumbies."
"Chandler";"No! No! No! I was so careful! (Runs out.)"
"Phoebe";"(To Rachel) Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving mecrazy!"
"Joey";"That’s right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey’s."
"Rachel";"No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! Ican throw wet paper towels here!"
"Phoebe";"No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!"
"Rachel";"I know. I’m sorry."
"Phoebe";"All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wetpaper towels.)"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"God, what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monica’s.)"
"Ross";"Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hotplate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other."
"Elizabeth";"For what it’s worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. Itfelt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more."
"Ross";"I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’sagainst the rules. It’s forbidden."
"Elizabeth";"Wow!"
"Ross";"What?"
"Elizabeth";"Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it’s really hot."
"Ross";"Really?"
"Elizabeth";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh, it’swrong."
"Elizabeth";"Stop it! (She starts to get all worked up.)"
"Ross";"(feeling it too) No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’snaughty. It’s taboo."
"Elizabeth";"Shut the book!"
"Ross";"Let’s also get a hot plate!"

"Joey";"So?"
"Chandler";"It’s Thursday! How was the audition?!"
"Joey";"Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what?Thurs—(He gasps in horror.) Oh! (Runs out and Chandler just shakes his head. After asecond Joey runs back in to grab a piece of pizza and runs back out.)"
"Joey";"Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! (He grabs ascrewdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit andshocks himself.) Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!"
"Rachel";"Hi Joey, how ya doin’?"
"Joey";"Great! Roomie!"
"Rachel";"Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now."
"Joey";"Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have toget a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot."
"Rachel";"I’m not paying for half of that! I’m only staying here untilmy apartment gets fixed."
"Joey";"Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now,I have"
"Rachel";"That refrigerators don’t live as long as people."
"Joey";"All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at atime, I’ll take a check for the other hundred."
"Rachel";"You’re jokin’ right?"
"Joey";"Of course I’m jokin’! I don’t take checks."

"Rachel";"Hey!"
"All";"Hi! Hey!"
"Rachel";"Do you guys know any cute guys?"
"Chandler";"Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats Joey’sarm, Joey pats Chandler’s shoulder, and Chandler motions for Joey to say the sameabout him.)"
"Joey";"Oh, I’m sorry. Thank you Chandler."

"Monica";"What’s the charity?"
"Rachel";"I don’t know, something either trees or disease—Ralph mumblesa lot."

"Elizabeth";"Oh hi!"
"All";"Hi!"
"Elizabeth";"I’m the student."
"Chandler";"(laughs) Isn’t she cute? (On Monica’s death stare) No!"
"Phoebe";"Y’know, this is probably none of my business, but weren’t youguys supposed to not be seen in public together?"
"Elizabeth";"Oh, we’re not together."
"Ross";"Oh no-no-no, we’re just two people who happen to run into each otherhere at the coffee house. (He winks at her.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, sly."
"Elizabeth";"Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. I’llsee you later?"
"All";"Okay!"
"Elizabeth";"Bye Ross."
"Ross";"Bye."
"Elizabeth";"Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir."
"Ross";"Oh that is quite all right ma’am. (Elizabeth exits.)"
"Chandler";"So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot ofhomework to do?"
"Ross";"Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow."
"Chandler";"Oh, tell her good luck with that."
"Ross";"Anyone else? Huh? Bring ‘em on!"

"Joey";"Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how’s itgoing with her?"
"Ross";"Well, actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s notlooking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now."
"Monica";"Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice."
"Ross";"Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it reallymeans a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are…"
"Phoebe";"(interrupting) Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?"
"Monica";"Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?"
"Chandler";"Yeah. Do we have any"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing."
"Chandler";"Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too."
"Phoebe";"Oh that’s good, I guess she’ll have a choice between my guyand your weirdo."
"Chandler";"Why would our guy be a weirdo?"
"Phoebe";"‘Cause that’s just your taste."
"Monica";"(laughs sarcastically) Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy."
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah?"
"Monica";"Yeah!"
"Phoebe";"My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (Shesqueezes the skin on her chin together to form…)"
"Chandler";"A face ass?"
"Phoebe";"A chin dimple!"
"Monica";"Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s reallynice and smart and he’s a great dresser!"
"Phoebe";"Have you seen your guy’s body?"
"Chandler";"No, our guy is just a floating head."
"Phoebe";"Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and onetime umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it."
"Monica";"You’re not supposed to look!"
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah, like there are police for that!"
"Chandler";"(horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me."
"Phoebe";"I know. (Laughs.)"
"Monica";"All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is reallyfunny."
"Phoebe";"Oh, Chandler funny?"

"Rachel";"I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because ofyou!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that thekind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like todance?" (Imitates him.) "Uhh, okay—I gotta go!""
"Monica";"All right guys stop it. Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a veryinsensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you, we havetwo really great guys for you."

"Rachel";"Yes, I’ll meet ‘em."

"Ross";"So uh, have a great time down there."
"Elizabeth";"I will."
"Ross";"Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?"
"Elizabeth";"Yeah."
"Ross";"It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm,I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’mfine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure."
"Elizabeth";"Oh, don’t worry I have plenty of sun block, it’s SPF-30."
"Ross";"Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes youget 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than notit’s just milk."

"Rachel";"I'm sorry, what?"
"Monica";"What?"
"Ross";"Excuse me?"
"Joey";"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimesyou need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take thisbig pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (Does this intense look whereit looks like he's smelling a fart.)"

"Monica";"I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month."
"Phoebe";"(in a sexy voice to Chandler) I’ll be waiting."
"Chandler";"Are you judging them by their covers? Because you’re really notsupposed to do that."
"Phoebe";"No, I’m just deciding which one to use—I’m gonna startwriting another book!"

"The Producer";"I’ll let you two guys get acquainted, huh? (Walks away.)"
"Joey";"Okay. Sorry about that…(Mimics that cheek thing he just did.) Uh, sowhere’s C.H.E.E.S.E.?"
"Wayne";"C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here. (He puts on his headset, picks up thecontroller, and wheels C.H.E.E.S.E. in. C.H.E.E.S.E. is just a plain old robot on tracks;he kinda looks like No. 5 in the movie"
"C.H.E.E.S.E.";"(Wayne with a computerized voice) Nice to meet you Mac!"
"Joey";"(laughs) This is like the temporary robot, right?"
"Wayne";"No. Why?"
"Joey";"Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot,y’know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you."
"Wayne";"I spent two years developing this machine, it’s absolutely state ofthe art."
"Joey";"I’m sorry, it just—I don’t know it doesn’t really looklike it can do anything."
"Wayne";"It can do this. (He moves C.H.E.E.S.E.’s arm close to Joey’sspecial area and he jumps back.)"
"Elizabeth";"This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller."
"Ross";"It-it’s great to meet you Paul."
"Paul";"I usually prefer Elizabeth’s boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens."
"Ross";"Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens."
"Paul";"So Ross, what your problem?"
"Ross";"Eh-wh—Excuse me?"
"Paul";"Why can’t you get a girlfriend your own age?"
"Ross";"That’s funny. Umm…. (Pause, then serious) It’s not funny."
"Ross";"Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, onechance I can, I can change your mind."
"Paul";"Okay."
"Ross";"What?"
"Paul";"Okay. I’ll give you one chance to change my mind. (Ross laughs inrelief) You got one minute. (Ross suddenly gets worried.)"
"Elizabeth";"Daddy!"
"Paul";"Fine! Two minutes. Go."
"Ross";"This is—you—(Ross starts laughing.)"
"Paul";"(laughs then checking his watch) 1 minute 50 seconds."
"Ross";"Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like thisbefore. I mean, I mean I’ve been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have neverdone it with a student—I mean I not—not"

"Monica";"(obviously attracted to him) Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?"
"Chandler";"There’s a Mr. Bing!"
"Paul";"No, unfortunately Lizzie’s mom passed away shortly after she wasborn. I raised her by myself."
"Phoebe and Monica";"(sympathetic) Ohh!"
"Paul";"I get that a lot."
"Ross";"Okay umm, why don’t we all take a seat, y’know? And uh, andI’ll get us all some uh some coffees—(He goes to pull out Elizabeth’schair, but Paul steps in)—Yeah, why don’t you. (Paul pulls out her chair) Uh andyou guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y’know? Whatever pops into yourhead. (He turns his back to Paul and Elizabeth and points to himself for Chandler, Monica,and Phoebe. Then he goes to order the coffee.)"
"Monica";"Y’know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day,‘cause usually he’s got the children’s hospital."
"Phoebe";"Yeah. Not looking for dates. (Monica turns in horror.)"
"Elizabeth";"So uh, Monica is Ross’s sister."
"Monica";"And he’s a"

"Rachel";"Oh! Ross is sooo great!"
"Chandler";"Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we weregonna to get the kind with the baby."
"Monica";"No, you said the baby creeps you out."
"Chandler";"No, the little girl creeps me out."
"Monica";"You said the baby."
"Chandler";"Why would the baby creep me out?"
"Monica";"Why would the little girl creep you out?"
"Phoebe";"(writing frantically) You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk alittle slower?"
"Chandler";"This is going in your book?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps, thepitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!"
"Monica";"What?! Excuse me!"
"Phoebe";"And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.(Chandler and Monica kiss.) And how people will believe anything you tell them as long asit’s a compliment."
"Rachel";"(seeing him) Oh hi!"
"Paul";"Hi! Hi. (He’s looking around.) I think I left my keys here somewhere."
"Rachel";"Oh! Well let’s look for them. (Finds some under one of the couchcushions. It has a pink, fuzzy ball on the key chain.) Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?"
"Paul";"No."
"Rachel";"All right! (Throws them back under the cushion.)"
"Paul";"Oh, here they are right here. (Picks them up from underneath the corner ofthe couch.)"
"Rachel";"Oh good."
"Paul";"Thanks for your help. (Starts to leave.)"
"Rachel";"(chasing after him) Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?"
"Paul";"Just call me Paul."
"Rachel";"Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy."
"Paul";"Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killinghim. (Rachel laughs then starts looking at him.) Are you okay?"
"Rachel";"You just don’t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter."
"Paul";"Well, we were very young when we had her."
"Rachel";"Oh. We?"
"Paul";"Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to… (He taps his indexfingers together.)"
"Rachel";"Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just—I meant y’know areyou still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’"
"Paul";"I’m just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born."
"Rachel";"(sympathetic) Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?"
"Paul";"Yes I did."
"Rachel";"Ohh. (She touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) Ooh!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Monica";"How was your first day?"
"Joey";"Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot."
"Chandler";"Damn those robots, they’re supposed to be our"
"Joey";"Anyway, it wasn’t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah,he doesn’t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I wasreaching for one! Ohh!"
"Phoebe";"Well, why don’t you just get him fired?"
"Joey";"I may have to, I hate to do it, but I’m the star! Y’know?There’s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. (His cell phonerings) Excuse me. (Answers it, on phone) Joey Tribbiani."
"Estelle";"(on the other end) Joe! I’m glad I found ya, I got an audition forya!"
"Joey";"Wow!"
"Estelle";"The thing is it’s kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the partdoesn’t know he might be fired. It’s the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E."
"Joey";"I’m the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!"
"Estelle";"Uh-oh!"
"Ross";"Joey?!"
"Paul";"Hi Ross."
"Rachel";"I was just getting him to like you."
"Ross";"Joey?! Joey!! (He runs into his bedroom.)"
"Rachel";"Ross, Joey is not here."
"Ross";"Okay, I’ll just wait for him in here!"
"Rachel";"Ross, it’s okay. You can come out."
"Paul";"Yeah Ross it’s okay, it’s me, Mr. Stevens."
"Ross";"(coming out of the bedroom) Oh! Oh my God! I didn’t even see you!"
"Paul";"Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into thebedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach. (Kisses her.)"
"Rachel";"Bye!"
"Paul";"I’ll call you later. Bye Ross. (Leaves)"
"Ross";"What-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!"
"Rachel";"Well, y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them…"
"Ross";"(incredulous) In your mouth?!"
"Rachel";"No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know, for like two hours,and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee."
"Ross";"You were at the coffee"

"Ross";"He is my girlfriend’s father, okay? It’s-it’s, it’sweird!"
"Rachel";"Wh—You dated my sister!"

"Ross";"How is that important?"
"Rachel";"Oh it’s important!"
"Joey";"Apparently, there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac,and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn’t knowhe could get me fired! What am I going to do?"
"Monica";"Well y’know Joey, you’re a pretty charming guy."
"Joey";"Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here."
"Monica";"No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controlsC.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!"
"Joey";"That’s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charmtomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. (Starts to leave, butstops and turns to Phoebe.) Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.(Exits.)"
"Chandler";"So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?"
"Monica";"Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side."
"Chandler";"Yeah, you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)"
"Phoebe";"(writing in her book) "You wish.""
"Monica";"Phoebe, stop writing about us!"
"Phoebe";"I’m not writing about you! I’m writing about other people."
"Chandler";"Who?"
"Phoebe";"Marcia and Chester."
"Monica";"Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I’ll just write about Phyllis!Hmm!"
"Chandler";"Hmm."
"Monica";"(writing on a piece of paper) Phyllis is sitting in a chair."
"Chandler";"Oh."
"Phoebe";"I see what you’re doing!"
"Monica";"(still writing) Phyllis sees what I’m doing."
"Chandler";"Oh-oh."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!"
"Joey";"Morning! Hey, how’s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!(Pats C.H.E.E.S.E. on the head.)"
"Wayne";"Don’t touch him!"
"Joey";"Okay! (He yanks his hand away.) All right. Umm, all right Wayne, levelwith me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they evenhave actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a secondchance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! (He grabs C.H.E.E.S.E.’s arm and pullsit off at the elbow.) Ah-ah!! (Wayne is shocked.) Okay, that’s why you didn’twant me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? (Hands Wayne the arm and he goes to fix it.Meanwhile Joey starts to berate himself.) Stupid! I can’t believe it! God! (A verybeautiful woman walks by.) (To her) Hey, how you doin’? (He and her go over to talkand Wayne looks on with envy.)"
"Rachel";"So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly,offered to take me."
"Elizabeth";"What a nice story!"
"Paul";"So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a younggirl to her high school prom."
"Rachel";"Wow! I"
"Ross";"Yeah, take your time."
"Ross";"(to Paul) Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. Soit wasn’t as bad as-as…"
"Paul";"Ross, look, I know I’ve been giving you a lot of jabs and it’spartly because I’m very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keepcoming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has toldme and the many, many, (pause) many stories that Rachel has told me that, well (pause)you’re not (pause) all bad."
"Ross";"Not all bad."
"Paul";"And anyhow, I’m sorry I was so harsh before, but you have tounderstand that I (pause) still look at Lizzie like she’s a twelve-year-old girl."
"Ross";"Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too."
"Paul";"I beg your pardon?"
"Ross";"No! No! Not—I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl!I mean I-I have a son, who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby."
"Paul";"You have a son?"
"Ross";"Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and justso you know, Carol and I are on"
"Paul";"Don’t worry about it, I just didn’t realize you were married.(Rachel returns and hears that.)"
"Rachel";"Oh we were, but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts), I meanthat was just a big drunken mistake."
"Ross";"You’re back."
"Paul";"You two were married?!"
"Rachel";"Oh! Whoops! I’m sorry, you were talking about Emily!"
"Monica";"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six."
"Chandler";"We said seven!"
"Monica";"We said six!"
"Chandler";"The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet atseven, not at six."
"Monica";"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this,"Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!""
"Phoebe";"(Turning around in the chair) Hi!"
"Chandler";"Oh my good God."
"Monica";"Ugh!"
"Phoebe";"I know what time you said."
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said."
"Monica";"What time?"
"Phoebe";"Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it’s my book to therescue, huh? (Reading her book) Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clearsthings up."
"Chandler";"(disgusted) What does it say?!"
"Phoebe";"I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book."
"Chandler";"Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you arethe queen of everything."
"Phoebe";"Thanks! So are you."
"Chandler";"(To Monica) I"
"Phoebe";"(reading from her book) Mon… (Pause as she restarts) Marcia andChester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they’resupposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it’s at seven."
"Chandler";"So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!"
"Phoebe";"That’s right."
"Monica";"Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!"
"Phoebe";"(writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis."
"Joey";"I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!"
"Chandler";"Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?"
"Joey";"Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard."
"Wayne";"Hey Joey, I want to talk to you."
"Joey";"Yeah? Well, I don’t want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruinedmy life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. (They shake hands.)"
"Chandler";"Hi, how are ya?"
"Wayne";"Joey, Joey, I-I-I’ll g-get you your job back if you help me out."
"Joey";"(incredulous) Why should I help you?!"
"Chandler";"(whispering in Joey’s ear) The reason he just said."
"Joey";"(happily) What do you need?"
"Wayne";"I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y’knowSarah?"
"Joey";"Yeah?"
"Wayne";"I wish I could talk to her."
"Joey";"What are you in love with her or something?"
"Wayne";"Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I’ve been there my friend."
"Wayne";"Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talkto women like you do."
"Joey";"Oh wow Wayne, it’s not really something you can teach y’know?It’s pretty much something you’re born with if you—(Off Chandler’slook)—You-you can teach it! I’ll show you right how to do it."
"Rachel";"I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from eachmarriage."
"Paul";"How to make the next one even shorter?"
"Rachel";"Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of alot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me. (Everyone looks ather, Ross not happily.) Maybe I have to pee again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)"
"Paul";"Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?"
"Ross";"Y’know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! Y’know,I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing butrespect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly…"
"Paul";"Are you yelling at me?!"
"Ross";"God no!"
"Elizabeth";"Y’know what daddy? If you don’t like Ross, that’sfine. It doesn’t matter to me, I’m gonna go out with him anyway."
"Paul";"Really?! (She nods in the affirmative.)"
"Ross";"Well if it doesn’t matter to her, it doesn’t matter to me! (toPaul) Still not yelling!"
"Paul";"Wow. What can I say? (Pause, pointing at Ross) This doesn’t make melike you any better!"
"Ross";"That’s okay, I’m not so crazy about myself right now either."
"Paul";"Then we agree?"
"Ross";"Uh yeah, I guess—Yeah! I guess so."
"Paul";"Neither of us like Ross!"
"Elizabeth";"I like Ross."
"Ross";"Ohhh! Kids!"
"Rachel";"(returning) Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about hownice Ross is!"
"Ross";"That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now."
"Rachel";"Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too!"

"Ross";"Why? What?"
"Monica";"Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?"
"Ross";"No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go,y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah,he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested infossils, huh?"

"Ross";"All right look, I-I realize it upsets you."
"Paul";"Yes it does."
"Ross";"But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t thinkthere’s really anything you can do about it."
"Paul";"I’ll call the university and tell them about your relationship andhave you fired."
"Ross";"Ohh! A man with a plan!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall offame! Eek!"

"Phoebe";"Rachel said that!"
"Monica";"Well Rachel’s not here! (Runs out.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh, Joey! Why did yousign it, "Son of a bitch?" (Son of a bitch is written across the entirepicture.)"

"Ross";"(to Elizabeth) And that is why we cannot see each other anymore."
"Paul";"Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk."
"Elizabeth";"Daddy!"
"Paul";"You’re next!!"
"Elizabeth";"Okay. I didn’t know he was here. (Runs over to Rachel.)"
"Paul";"Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from mydaughter or I’ll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come upto my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!""
"Ross";"Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain…"
"Paul";"No, let me explain! Fired!!"
"Ross";"All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that youand I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy. (Paul just looks at him.)"
"Paul";"(panicked) What?"
"Ross";"And I too am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimicsPaul’s flexing.)"
"Paul";"Ross, let me show you where the guest room is."
"Monica";"(going over to him) I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out."
"Chandler";"I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman namedHeldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one ofthose Chandler noises.)"
"Monica";"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our namesdown for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?"
"Chandler";"Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)"
"Monica";"Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebeand Rachel…"
"Chandler";"Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before mewere you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 whoare available by the way!"
"Monica";"It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, becauseit doesn’t."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Monica";"Really?"
"Chandler";"Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know thatI’m just not ready…"
"Monica";"I know! I know."
"Chandler";"Okay. (They hug.)"
"Monica";"I’m gonna go tell Joey that (laughs) that you’re back. I wasreally worried about you. (Exits.)"
"Phoebe";"(entering from her room) Hey, did she buy it?"
"Chandler";"Totally."
"Phoebe";"So did Heldi show you the place?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, it’s beautiful."
"Phoebe";"I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!"
"Chandler";"I know."
"Joey";"Hey Gunther."
"Gunther";"Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there(points) wants the biscotti."
"Joey";"Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go."
"Gunther";"Do you still work here?"
"Joey";"No! No, I quit a long time ago. (Pause) Did I forget to you that one?I’m sorry."
"Gunther";"Oh that’s cool, I was gonna fire you anyway."
"Joey";"Great! (Takes his coffee and leaves.)"
"Chandler";"Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? Ican’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page)Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!"
"Phoebe";"Now, have you told anyone else?"
"Chandler";"No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t wantMonica to find out."
"Phoebe";"You told me."
"Chandler";"Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my bestfriends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
"Phoebe";"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’tbeen on the toilet."
"Chandler";"Me too."
"Joey";"Hey. (Heads straight for the fridge.)"
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Phoebe";"Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?"
"Chandler";"Oh all right."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, coffeehouse."
"Ross";"Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go."
"Chandler";"Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place."
"Ross";"How rude."
"Joey";"Oh, I’m sorry. You wanna bite? (Holds his piece out for him.)"
"Phoebe";"So how are things going with Paul?"
"Rachel";"Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, Iwish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings."
"Phoebe";"That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of picklesthat won’t open."
"Rachel";"So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang hishead against a table?"
"Phoebe";"No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out ofsomeone."
"Paul";"(entering) Hi honey."
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"(To Rachel) Watch this."
"Paul";"(To Rachel) How are you?"
"Rachel";"(To Phoebe) Okay."
"Phoebe";"Hi Paul!"
"Paul";"Hi Phoebe."
"Phoebe";"So how are things going with you?"
"Paul";"Can’t complain."
"Paul";"(whispering) Come on."
"Rachel";"Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave with Paul.)"
"Paul";"(To Ross) Hey!"
"Ross";"Hi!"
"Paul";"Ross!"
"Ross";"Great to see you!"
"Paul";"Good to see you too!"
"Ross";"How you doing?"
"Paul";"Good. Bye! (Starts to leave.)"
"Ross";"Okay! You take care!"
"Ross";"Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us offbefore?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah! That was so weird, huh?"
"Ross";"Phoebe, why’d you do it?"
"Phoebe";"I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad atyou!"
"Ross";"What?! Why?!"
"Phoebe";"Please, I think you know why."
"Ross";"I can’t think of anything."
"Phoebe";"Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper."
"Ross";"Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to thatKnicks game a couple of weeks ago?"
"Phoebe";"Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?"
"Ross";"I guess it could."
"Phoebe";"Well then I think that’s it."
"Ross";"Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-Iwish he would just tell me the truth."
"Phoebe";"Oh, if that’s what you want you then you really should run his headunder hot water and bang his head against a table."
"Paul";"Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?"
"Rachel";"Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell meabout your day."
"Paul";"It was fine."
"Rachel";"Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?"
"Paul";"I’m thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress."
"Rachel";"Yeah that’s great Paul, but y’know I wanna knowwhat—(Puts her hands on his shoulders)—Wow, those are really great! I just wannaknow what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y’know they say thatstill waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours."
"Paul";"Are you talking about having sex?"
"Rachel";"No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-likeyour childhood! Tell me about your childhood!"
"Paul";"Normal."
"Rachel";"Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painfultime! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your handin warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag."
"Paul";"Nope! That never happened to me!"
"Rachel";"Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway,umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?"
"Paul";"Nope."
"Rachel";"All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give mesomething. Anything!"
"Paul";"Okay."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Paul";"Okay."
"Rachel";"All right."
"Paul";"When I was six years old."
"Rachel";"Hm-mmm."
"Paul";"I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plasticchicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was apretty tough year."
"Rachel";"That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you alittle better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go. (Gets up toleave, but Paul doesn’t move.)"
"Paul";"It was horrible. They called me chicken boy."
"Rachel";"Oh!"
"Paul";"And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn’t really afight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a littlescare right here (points to it) you can see it."
"Rachel";"Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is reallygreat that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’sbeautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?"

"Rachel";"What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung PaoChicken!"
"Paul";"Chicken? (Pointing to himself.) Chicken boy!"
"Rachel";"My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! Iwouldn’t do that!"
"Chandler";"Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too andI can’t find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and startspointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers iswatching him.) It’s a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)"
"Phoebe";"Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you dosomething different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know?Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one upfrom the display in the corner."
"Chandler";"Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this."
"Phoebe";"Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her thisgorgeous piece of weaponry?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I’m gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another displaycounter.) Oh, this one’s nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh,kind sir? Can I see this one?"
"Phoebe";"(coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute, no, this is,this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this fromhere on out."
"Male Jeweler";"Can I help you?"
"Chandler";"Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please."
"Phoebe";"Or not, whatever."
"Male Jeweler";"This ring is from the 1920s, it’s a one and a half caratdiamond with sapphires on either side."
"Chandler";"Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and askme to marry you?"
"Male Jeweler";"Okay. (Holds out the ring, deadpan.) Will you marry me?"
"Chandler";"(choking up) Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How muchis it?"
"Phoebe";"Chandler, I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much"
"Male Jeweler";"8,600."
"Phoebe";"We will give you $10."
"Male Jeweler";"(angrily) Are you interested in this ring?!"
"Chandler";"Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000."
"Male Jeweler";"Okay, I can let it go at eight."

"Joey";"No."
"Ross";"Remember? You-you were eating pizza."
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him aticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago."
"Joey";"Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is alwaysmooching off of us!"
"Ross";"Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up,y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game andinvite him."

"Gunther";"(handing them the bill) Here you go."
"Ross";"Oh. (Starts to get his money)"

"Joey";"All the time!"
"Rachel";"Oh my God! Oh my God!!"
"Monica";"Still crying?"
"Rachel";"Like a"
"Monica";"Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And oneof them is sex."
"Rachel";"What’s the other one?"
"Monica";"I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one. I’mjust saying y’know, if we’re having sex, he’s not gonna be talking."
"Rachel";"Oh that’s right. You’re the talker. (They both reflect on thatbriefly) Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buyhim some more tissues."
"Monica";"Oh, we have some…"
"Rachel";"No you don’t!"
"Phoebe";"Okay umm, I’d also like to try on the tiara. (The male jewelerhands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think, toomuch?"
"Male Jeweler";"A tad."
"Phoebe";"Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (Hehands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Something’smissing. It’s not… Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out."
"Male Jeweler";"(to the female jeweler) Where’s the 1920s princess cut ring."
"Female Jeweler";"I just sold it to that gentleman. (Points to the one walking outthe store.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God!! (She runs after him, but sets of the security system, whichlocks the store’s door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) No!What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)"
"Paul";"Rachel?"
"Chandler";"No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)"

"Chandler";"No, did he hug you?!"
"Paul";"No! No! It’s just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad."

"Chandler";"Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go withthe one I picked first."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they (pointsto the jeweler) put me in jail!"
"Chandler";"They put you in jail?"
"Phoebe";"The little jail between the doors!"
"Chandler";"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!"
"Phoebe";"I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monicanever even saw the other ring."
"Chandler";"Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps."
"Phoebe";"Maybe it was the guy."
"Chandler";"It was the ring!"
"Ross";"Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?"
"Joey";"No! He blew us off!"
"Ross";"What?!"
"Joey";"I know!"
"Ross";"I can’t believe it. (Pause) Can I tell you something? I’m alittle mad at him now."
"Joey";"Can I tell you something? Me too."
"Ross";"Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry,well maybe we don’t talk to him"
"Joey";"Ooooh! Freeze him out."
"Ross";"That’s right!"
"Joey";"I like it!"
"Ross";"Eh? We’ll show him!"
"Joey";"From now on, it’s gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. (They shakehands.) Okay! We’re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler."

"Rachel";"Ah that’s great. No actually that’s… (In a sexy voice)That’s great! That’s really great! Y’know, I gotta tell ya writing, I meanwriting, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot."
"Paul";"Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! (Flips a couple pages and points tosomething.) Y’know what I wanted to be when I was that age?"
"Rachel";"A lover?"
"Paul";"A surfer."
"Rachel";"Oh yeah surfer?"
"Paul";"I wanted to be one with the waves, y’know?"
"Rachel";"Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, (sits on thecounter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here.Wait, now wait a second, this isn’t too revealing is it?"
"Paul";"(barely glancing at her) No. What ever happened to that little dude.(Pause) So full of dreams…"
"Rachel";"I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listento anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is amental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Doyou know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you knowwhen I figured that out? While you were talking!"
"Paul";"What?! I can’t believe you’re trying to stifle me! When just 14hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!"
"Rachel";"Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’tmean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming."
"Paul";"Oh Rachel, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to overwhelm you.It’s just that, when those gates open, you… (Starts to breakdown.) Hard to close‘em. But they are closed now. Believe me."
"Rachel";"I’m so glad, I’m so glad you shared. (Feeling his shoulder.)And I’m glad that you’re done. What do you say we umm… (Nods in thedirection of the bedroom.)"
"Paul";"I would really like that. (They kiss.)"
"Paul";"That was…so good. (Starts crying again.)"
"Phoebe";"(entering from her room) Hey."
"Chandler";"I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumballmachine looking ring!"
"Phoebe";"It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s abeautiful ring!"
"Chandler";"No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could seeMonica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes.When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and thenI can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thingI’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect."
"Phoebe";"Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back.‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe wecan get him to trade rings or something."
"Chandler";"I can’t do that."
"Phoebe";"Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring."
"Phoebe";"There he is! (Points.)"
"Chandler";"Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on herfinger."
"Phoebe";"Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes."
"Chandler";"Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him."
"Phoebe";"Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with meplease? You have a phone call."
"Customer";"Who is it?"
"Phoebe";"It is your office."
"Customer";"Do you know who at my office?"
"Phoebe";"John?"
"Customer";"Oh John! Great!"
"Phoebe";"(To Chandler) Here he is."
"Chandler";"(to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store,the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I’mgonna need to have that back. (The guy isn’t sure.) But, in exchange I’m willingto trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew."
"Phoebe";"Wow! I would trade."
"Customer";"It is beautiful, but I’m gonna use this one. Now, if you’llexcuse me."
"Chandler";"No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring.You don’t want to break her heart now do you?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?"
"Customer";"You’re dying?!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently."
"Phoebe";"Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m notburied with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for alleternity…"
"Chandler";"(interrupting her) Okay, that’s enough honey!"
"Customer";"I don’t know. (Pause) Let me see the ring."
"Chandler";"Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)"
"Customer";"(looks at it) All right. (Exchanges rings.)"
"Chandler";"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And"
"Chandler";"Guys? (They ignore him.) I’ve got something important to tell ya.(Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over totry and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) I’m gonna ask Monica tomarry me."
"Joey";"(To Ross) I think we gotta end the freeze out."

"Joey";"And-and-and-and-and-and, and we’re gonna be friends again!"

"Joey";"Oh it’s water under the bridge, forget it!"
"Chandler";"Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait ‘til uh, it was officialy’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my bestfriends."

"Chandler";"It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant.I’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knowshow expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I’mjust gonna propose."
"Rachel";"Ohh…"
"Joey";"That sounds perfect!"
"Chandler";"Yeah."
"Joey";"You’re gonna mess it up let me do it."
"Chandler";"I’m not gonna mess it up."
"Phoebe";"If she says no, can I have the ring?"

"Richard";"That might be fun. (Richard and Lisa sit down.)"
"Joey";"I didn’t know it was an auction!"
"Rachel";"Wh?!"
"Joey";"I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!"
"Rachel";"Why would a charity give away a free boat?!"
"Joey";"I don’t know! Charity?"
"Rachel";"Ugh!"
"Phoebe";"Well, just buy the damn boat! (She’s still working her way throughher tray of booze.)"
"Rachel";"Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?"
"Phoebe";"I’m just helping the kids!"
"Rachel";"How is you drinking helping the kids?"
"Phoebe";"Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink."
"Mr. Thompson";"(approaching) Mr. Tribbiani."
"Joey";"Oh hi!"
"Mr. Thompson";"Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to buildingthe youth center."
"Joey";"Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?"
"Mr. Thompson";"I think it was valued at 19,000"
"Joey";"(To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so badnews. Umm, I can’t buy the boat, I don’t have any money."
"Rachel";"Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)"
"Mr. Thompson";"That’s good. Very good! (Walks away.)"
"Joey";"So uh listen, I think I’m gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)"
"Rachel";"(stopping him) Hey! You…can’t…leave Joey! You agreed tobuy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonnakill me!"
"Joey";"Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money!"
"Rachel";"I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. Allright, this is what we’re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, andwe are just gonna let them buy it, and then you’re just gonna pay the difference."
"Joey";"Okay."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Joey";"Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway!Y’know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!"
"Rachel";"Not great."
"Monica";"And so, we’re hiding in the bathroom."
"Richard";"And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in."
"Monica";"So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re goingat it right on the bathroom floor."
"Lisa";"(laughing) Oh my God!"
"Chandler";"I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both myparents making love to the same guy."
"Richard";"It’s so great seeing you guys again. I’d like to make atoast. (Everyone raises their glasses) Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness offriendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little thingsthe heart finds it’s morning and is refreshed.""
"Monica";"Ohh."
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Ross";"Oh my God, you guys!! (He’s excited about what he thought happened.)"
"Chandler";"(stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have wegot a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!"
"Ross";"Who?"
"Chandler";"Richard!"
"Ross";"What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh that’s right that’sright. That’s Richard’s favorite place too."
"Chandler";"Oh you knew that. Good!"
"Monica";"I thought you were going out with Elizabeth."
"Ross";"Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight."
"Monica";"Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t getout of!"
"Ross";"Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was overthere and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. Ifinally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do."
"Monica";"Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationshipagainst the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first (looks at Chandler andpauses) weighing stuff."
"Ross";"Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is."
"Monica";"If the school finds out you’re fired."
"Ross";"Hmm."
"Monica";"She’s leaving for three months."
"Chandler";"For cam"
"Ross";"Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and prettyand…"
"Monica";"Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see afuture?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (Ross pauses inconsideration.) Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn’t you?!"
"Ross";"No! No! I…didn’t do that. It’s just… Okay, honestlyno. I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her."
"Monica";"Okay well I think…that’s your answer."
"Ross";"I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part."

"Phoebe";"Oh, en chante. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he onlyshakes it.)"
"Joey";"Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?"
"Mr. Bowmont";"That’s me."
"Joey";"Ahh, yes. (Pushes Rachel in front of himself so that she could do thetalking.)"
"Rachel";"Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman daysailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000."
"Joey";"You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess."

"Rachel";"Ohh…"
"Joey";"Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat!"
"Rachel";"Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name?"
"Mr. Bowmont";"It’s Pam."

"Rachel";"Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont.""
"Joey";"Oooooh…"
"Mr. Bowmont";"I don’t think so dear."
"Rachel";"Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. (She sits down next tohim.) All right, you are settin’ sail up the Hudson! You’ve got the wind in yourh—(sees that he’s bald)—arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet thatyou’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! Youcan—ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, andthen when you’re old, Cappy."
"Mr. Bowmont";"What the hell, it’s for a good cause! All right!"
"Joey";"No way! It’s mine!!"
"Rachel";"(To Joey) What?! What?!"
"Joey";"All that stuff you just said? I want that!"
"Rachel";"But Joey you don’t have $20,000!"
"Joey";"Who cares?! I-I’ll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr.Bowmont!!"
"Joey";"Oh my God, you’re back!"
"Phoebe";"Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is franticallytrying to wave them off.)"
"Monica";"Why do you want to see my hand?"
"Phoebe";"I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash."
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"Eww! Oh, it’s all dirty. You should throw this out."
"Monica";"(suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebe’s wishes.)"
"Chandler";"(after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!"
"Phoebe";"What happened?"
"Chandler";"Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!"
"Joey";"What?! Noooo… (Phoebe gasps.)"
"Chandler";"I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, butnow you’ve ruined it!"
"Joey";"We didn’t ruin it!"
"Chandler";"Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!"
"Phoebe";"Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor…"
"Phoebe";"Good one! Yeah."
"Chandler";"This is terrible. What am I going to do?"
"Phoebe";"Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure,so just throw her off the track."
"Chandler";"That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriageis the last thing on my mind."
"Phoebe";"Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment!Convince her that you’re a little coward!"
"Chandler";"I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice."
"Joey";"Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)"
"Monica";"(entering) I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiotkeeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!"
"Joey";"That guy’s still doing that?!"
"Rachel";"(entering) Hey! (Sees Monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) Oh my Godyou’re here, let me see your hand!!"
"Phoebe";"No, you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!"
"Ross";"(in his head)"
"Elizabeth";"(sticking her head out her window) Ross! Wait!"
"Ross";"Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about…"
"Elizabeth";"You suck!!"
"Ross";"What?!"
"Ross";"Okay, break-up’s still on!"
"Chandler";"Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do Ilook? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?"
"Joey";"Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. (They both squint at eachother.) I never noticed that before."
"Monica";"(entering) Hi guys!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Monica";"What are you up too?"
"Chandler";"Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.)Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary itis and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you."
"Joey";"(laughs) Yeah, Big Brother."
"Monica";"Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hearthat you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet."
"Chandler";"Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, whywould anybody ever want to get married huh?"
"Monica";"Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! Todeclare your love for one another to the world!"
"Chandler";"Eh…"
"Monica";"Okay well that’s good to know."
"Joey";"(all excited) The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!! (Jumps over the back off thecouch and runs out into the street.)"
"Waitress";"Hey Monica, there’s a customer who wants to complement the chef,should I let him in?"
"Monica";"Sure, I love this part! (Starts to look busy.)"
"Waitress";"(to the customer) Come on in."
"Richard";"Hi!"
"Monica";"Richard!"
"Richard";"Actually, I’m not here to complement the chef."
"Monica";"Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back tocomplement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up?"
"Richard";"Well, it was great seeing you the other night."
"Monica";"Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?"
"Richard";"No! I came here to tell you something else. (Pause) I came here (Pause)to tell you I still love you."
"Monica";"What uh—What did you—What?!"
"Richard";"I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn’t even be heretelling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you sayhe’s straight I’ll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if Ididn’t tell ya I’d regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was thestupidest thing I ever did."
"Monica";"Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!"
"Richard";"Well yeah, I’m sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrongplace but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wannahave kids with you."
"Monica";"Oh God… (Starts looking around.) Why don’t they put chairsback here?!"
"Richard";"I know this is crazy but am I too late?"
"Monica";"What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three yearsago?!"
"Richard";"Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did!Y’know after we had lunch last year I spent"
"Monica";"What were you doing in Africa?"
"Richard";"Working with blind kids."
"Monica";"Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry butumm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen."
"Richard";"Okay that’s fine, I’ll walk away. And I’ll never botheryou again, but"
"Monica";"Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, infact, I’m the one that’s making"
"Richard";"You are?"
"Monica";"Yeah!"
"Richard";"Why?"
"Monica";"Why? Because of the government."
"Rachel";"Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married."
"Phoebe";"I know, they’re gonna be"
"Rachel";"Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does thathappen?"
"Rachel";"No! I’m so happy for them!"
"Phoebe";"Me too! So happy for them!"
"Rachel";"I’m so happy and not at all jealous."
"Phoebe";"Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!"
"Rachel";"I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I meanwhat’s 2%? That’s nothing."
"Phoebe";"Totally. I’m like 90/10."
"Rachel";"Yeah me too."
"Joey";"Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?"
"Rachel";"(staring at him) Wh—no, but y’know who did stop in herelooking for ya, Tennille."
"Monica";"So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’treally believe that do you?"
"Chandler";"Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage isunnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigsdon’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in alifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!"
"Monica";"Yeah, but that’s"
"Chandler";"If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what thedivorce rate in this country is? 97%."
"Monica";"Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may"
"Chandler";"Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never."
"Monica";"Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!"
"Chandler";"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind ofstrategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!"
"Monica";"Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!"
"Chandler";"(to them) It’s okay, I got a plan."
"Rachel";"We’re gonna find love!"
"Phoebe";"Definitely!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it soeasy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a littleguarantee though."
"Phoebe";"What do you mean?"
"Rachel";"Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neitherof them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other."
"Phoebe";"You mean a backup?"
"Rachel";"Exactly!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, yeah I got that."
"Rachel";"You do?"
"Phoebe";"Hm-mmm."
"Rachel";"Who?"
"Phoebe";"Joey."
"Rachel";"Joey?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah!"
"Rachel";"Are you serious?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I locked him years ago!"
"Rachel";"Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re40, you’re gonna marry Joey."
"Phoebe";"Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted toseal the deal."
"Rachel";"Oh, seriously?"
"Phoebe";"Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were… (She makes two clickingsounds with her tongue and purrs.)"
"Rachel";"Charming."
"Phoebe";"Well hey, it’s just a backup."
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Joey";"Hey Monica!"
"Monica";"Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?"
"Joey";"This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?"
"Monica";"Yeah, it’s great."
"Joey";"Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain!"
"Monica";"I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re ina dead-end relationship!"
"Joey";"Chandler giving you a hard time huh?"
"Monica";"It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just thatI-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually goingsomewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!"
"Joey";"Well, you know Chandler."
"Monica";"No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’slike something’s changed."
"Joey";"Maybe you changed?"
"Monica";"I didn’t change!"
"Joey";"Maybe that’s the problem."
"Monica";"What?!"
"Joey";"Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife."
"Monica";"Is that some kind of boat talk?"
"Joey";"I don’t know! (All excited) I haven’t totally decided how totalk on my boat yet."
"Monica";"What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around fornothing?"
"Joey";"Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!"
"Monica";"(starts for the door) Well there’s some people who do want to marryme."
"Joey";"There are?"
"Monica";"Yeah! Richard!"
"Joey";"R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-andChandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?!"
"Monica";"That’s right."
"Joey";"Chandler"
"Monica";"You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complexfellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and alwayswill be!"
"Joey";"You got"
"Narrator";"When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone."
"Ross";"What happened you guys?"
"Ross";"Rach!"
"Rachel";"Hey you!"
"Ross";"Hey, come on in."
"Rachel";"Oh thank you. Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you andElizabeth."
"Ross";"Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, butuh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be."
"Rachel";"Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?"
"Ross";"I guess so."
"Rachel";"So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by thetime we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, andwe’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprisesthere! You know what I mean? No like, "What’s that?!""
"Ross";"Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup."
"Rachel";"Exactly."
"Ross";"Ohh, yeah I already have one."
"Rachel";"What? Who?"
"Ross";"Phoebe."
"Rachel";"Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just, she said that Joey was herbackup."
"Ross";"Ohh, I don’t think so."
"Rachel";"Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joeymade a deal!"
"Ross";"That’s impossible! I mean"
"Joey";"Where the hell have you been?!"
"Chandler";"I was making a coconut phone with the professor."
"Joey";"Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!"
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Joey";"Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing withher and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldn’t keepflying off!"
"Chandler";"My—Oh my God!"
"Joey";"I know! They suck!!"
"Chandler";"He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’msupposed to do that!"
"Joey";"I know!"
"Chandler";"Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna goover there; I’m gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!"
"Joey";"Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is asolution. Okay? Just"
"Chandler";"You’re right."
"Joey";"Yeah!"
"Chandler";"Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) I’m gonna get the ring!I’m gonna get the ring! (Does so) I’m gonna go find her and (starts running forthe door) I’m just going to propose!"
"Joey";"Okay."
"Chandler";"Okay great."
"Joey";"Dude-dude-dude!"
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Joey";"Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat."
"Monica";"Hi."
"Richard";"Hi."
"Monica";"I don’t know why I’m here."
"Richard";"I didn’t ask. You wanna come in?"
"Monica";"I don’t know."
"Richard";"Oh, okay. Well, I’ll just leave the door open and go sit on thecouch. (Does so.)"
"Monica";"(entering) Chandler is such an idiot!"
"Richard";"(standing up quickly) Drink?"
"Monica";"Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…"
"Richard";"…on the rocks with a twist? I remember. (Goes to make her drink.)"
"Monica";"(moving over to the couch) Still smoking cigars?"
"Richard";"Uh, no! No! That’s…art! If it bothers you I can put my artout."
"Monica";"No that’s, that’s okay."
"Richard";"So Monica let me ask you a question. Y’know, since we broke up doyou ever, think about me?"
"Monica";"Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago."
"Richard";"Oh really?"
"Monica";"Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my neweye doctor."
"Richard";"Who is it?"
"Monica";"Edward Nevski?"
"Richard";"Yeah he’s no good. Do you ever (pause) think about me in a (pause)non-eye doctor way?"
"Monica";"No."
"Richard";"Ahh."
"Monica";"But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do.And I never let myself think about you."
"Rachel";"Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!"
"Phoebe";"Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look,I’ve already lost Chandler!"
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey!"
"Ross";"(entering) Hey!"
"Joey";"Phoebe! We’re both (points at Ross and himself) your backup?!"
"Ross";"Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!"
"Phoebe";"I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complainingabout now? You were both aware of the situation!"
"Joey";"No we weren’t!"
"Ross";"I was not!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!"
"Rachel";"Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!"
"Joey";"Pick me!!"
"Ross";"No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!"
"Phoebe";"All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has aboat—This is hard!"
"Joey";"This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!"
"Ross";"Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!"
"Phoebe";"No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys!Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married,three times a week."
"Rachel";"Oh God, Phoebe!"
"Phoebe";"(To Rachel) I’m talking about massages."
"Rachel";"Oh."
"Rachel";"Okay, y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All righthere, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin (does so)and I’m gonna right Ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one!And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?"
"Joey";"Okay that’s fair."
"Ross";"All right."
"Phoebe";"Good!"
"Rachel";"Pick one."
"Phoebe";"Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfoldand read them.) Thank you."
"Rachel";"You’re welcome."
"Phoebe";"(reading) Ross!"
"Rachel";"(reading) Joey! (Pause) We should just switch."
"Phoebe";"Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.)"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Monica";"(to the mask) I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!"
"Richard";"Excuse me?"
"Monica";"Oh! (Laughs and points at the mask.) Him."
"Richard";"Oh. (Laughs.) Whew!"
"Monica";"I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up’s apartment!Y’know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!"
"Richard";"Yeah! You’re saying, you need to be with someone more mature.Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache."
"Monica";"Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need tobe with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of workand telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I"
"Richard";"I think that’s fair."
"Monica";"Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’vebeen you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting tomarry me now! Believe me,"
"Richard";"It’s okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. (Hugs her) Shhhh."
"Monica";"Nothing. (She backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looksup at his eyes.) I don’t kn—Umm. I don’t know. Umm…"
"Richard";"I know. (Backs away.)"
"Monica";"Y’know, I-I… I have to figure…some st—Y’know,some stuff before I can…"
"Richard";"Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. (Pause) Ten, eventwenty minutes if you need it. I’ll be here. Not smoking. (Monica leaves.)"
"Richard";"Chandler."
"Chandler";"Where is she? I’m not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walksin.)"
"Richard";"She’s not here and please come in."
"Chandler";"(examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on acoaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!"
"Richard";"Okay, she was here, but she left."
"Chandler";"Well where did she go?"
"Richard";"Well she said she had to think things over."
"Chandler";"Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought…Ithought you were a good guy."
"Richard";"Oh, hey look nothing happened."
"Chandler";"Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend thatyou love her?"
"Richard";"Well all right, one thing happened?"
"Chandler";"Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did?My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!"
"Richard";"Well I’m sorry."
"Chandler";"And what does she have to think about? I love her!"
"Richard";"Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not."
"Chandler";"But I"
"Richard";"Well if it helps, it worked very well."
"Chandler";"It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, thisisn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! Andthis is my chance and I am not going to blow it because"
"Richard";"You were gonna propose? (Sits on the arm of the couch.)"
"Chandler";"Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Didyou get a ring?"
"Richard";"No I don’t have a ring! (Pause) You go get her Chandler. (Pause)And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don’t let her go. Trust me."
"Chandler";"Y’know Richard…you are a good guy."
"Richard";"I know. (Pause) I"
"Joey";"Dude!"
"Chandler";"I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!"
"Joey";"She’s gone."
"Chandler";"What?"
"Joey";"She’s gone. She had a bag and she left."
"Chandler";"What are you talking about?"
"Joey";"She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and thatand that she needed time to think."
"Chandler";"Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell herit was a plan?!"
"Joey";"I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believeme."
"Chandler";"Well where… Where did she go?"
"Joey";"To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. Butif I were you I would."
"Chandler";"I can’t believe I ruined this."
"Joey";"I am so sorry man."
"Monica";"You wanted it to be a surprise."
"Chandler";"Oh my God."

Then I realized the only thing that matters isthat you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cryagain.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make youfeel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?"

"Rachel";"Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubtshe’s even had time to…"
"Phoebe";"Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down myapartment?"

"Joey";"But I-I-I can’t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercialaudition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I’m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.(Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?"
"Chandler";"So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?"
"Joey";"You guys don’t think I look 19?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!"
"Monica";"Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go!"
"Rachel";"Okay."

"Phoebe";"Oh honey no, you ate it all."
"Joey";"I was afraid of that."
"Monica";"(looking at her hand) Y’know what shoes would look great with thisring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) You’re not getting dressed.(Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)"
"Chandler";"Know what I mean?"
"Monica";"Yeah, but I don’t think we have time."
"Chandler";"There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Twohundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress."
"Monica";"(lustily) Let’s do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto thebed.)"
"Monica";"(chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-youwere probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!"
"Chandler";"(motioning with his hands) I’m not worried, I’m uh, I’mfascinated. Y’know it’s like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high schoolI uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from herroom with her guitar.)"
"Phoebe";"Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.(Singing)"
"Monica";"Phoebe!"
"Phoebe";"If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’sprobably not gay."
"Chandler";"Sure, you guys don’t have this problem, you’re made of wood.(Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"You look great!"
"Rachel";"(quietly) Oh, thanks."
"Chandler";"You okay over there?"
"Rachel";"I don’t know, y’know? I feel a little umm… No,y’know what? Nevermind, I’m gonna be fine."
"Chandler";"Oh, don’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you hada lot of champagne, it happens to everybody."

"Ross";"Well sure. But I get married all the time so…"
"Rachel";"Ohh…"

"Ross";"You mean, we—you and me?"
"Rachel";"Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone."
"Ross";"Oh good, you scared me for a minute."
"Rachel";"Shake it off."
"Ross";"I mean—no, it’s just ‘cause, it’s just ’cause youand I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No, but there was some good times."
"Rachel";"No, absolutely. Y’know like it was umm…"
"Ross";"Surely you can think of something good."
"Rachel";"Yeah, just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well, yes, I can think of onegood thing."
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff."
"Ross";"Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?"
"Rachel";"Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands."
"Ross";"My hands?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"Uh-huh."
"Ross";"(to his hands) Way to go guys. Y’know, you-you were really good atthe stuff too."
"Rachel";"Oh, I know. Hey, y’know what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Ohno, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had bonus night!"
"Ross";"A what?"
"Rachel";"Y’know, bonus night. Y’know, when two people break up but theyget back together for just one night."
"Ross";"One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?"
"Rachel";"Yeah-yeah, we never had that,"
"Ross";"No."
"Ross";"Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I’m-I’m sure itwould be amazing but I…gotta say I really-really don’t think it would be a goodidea. Y’know? I really, really…don’t."
"Joey";"‘Sup? ‘Sup dude?"
"Chandler";"(putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please don’thurt me."
"Joey";"So you’re playing a little"
"Chandler";"Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look,you are definitely 19."
"Joey";"Come on man, really how old?!"
"Chandler";"Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed becauseeverybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!"
"Joey";"Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)"
"Chandler";"Joe?"
"Joey";"Yeah!"
"Chandler";"Uhh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?"
"Joey";"When? Today? Some, not a lot."
"Chandler";"Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kindof eh, uh, I was unable to—I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn’t….There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident."
"Joey";"Don’t worry about that man, that happens."
"Chandler";"It’s happened to you?"
"Joey";"Yeah! Once."
"Chandler";"Well, what’d you do?"
"Joey";"I did it anyway."
"Monica";"Phoebe! Come on! Let’s go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebeenters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why aren’t you dressed yet?!"
"Phoebe";"I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding.Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)"
"Monica";"(grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, ifyou get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding."
"Phoebe";"Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon,if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit."
"Monica";"Fair enough, now go get ready!"
"Phoebe";"Okay. (She goes to get ready.)"
"Monica";"I’ll get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebratingmy—(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.)I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past."
"Ross";"Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw…"
"Monica";"(interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Monica";"See, I’ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike somepeople I’m only planning on doing this once. So, uh y’know, maybe this isselfish and I’m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be aboutthat."
"Rachel";"Oh honey, but it is just about…"
"Ross";"It is! It is!"
"Monica";"No it’s not! No! No! Now it’s about you and Ross getting backtogether!"
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Monica";"See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!"
"Ross";"Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are"
"Rachel";"Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!"
"Ross";"Yeah!"
"Monica";"That’s true."
"Rachel";"Honey I swear it we just kissed."
"Ross";"It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)"
"Phoebe";"You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you gettingback together?! Can I sing at your wedding?"
"Monica";"Thunder being stolen!!"
"Rachel";"Okay come on Phoebe, it’s nothing! Monica, come on!"
"Ross";"Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a"
"Joey";"Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problemsin the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing thebest he can!!"
"Chandler";"(angrily) I don’t think that’s what they were talking aboutJoe!!"
"Phoebe";"What a great night, Chandler can’t do it, these guys kissed…(Points to Ross and Rachel.)"
"Joey";"What?"
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Joey";"You guys kissed! Oh my—this is huge!"
"Rachel";"No!"
"Ross";"Oh no!"
"Rachel";"No-no, it’s really not huge."
"Ross";"And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that"
"Monica";"Well, we’re still talking about it, aren’t we?"
"Phoebe";"Well yeah, that and Chandler’s problem."
"Joey";"Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would itmake you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel."
"Monica";"Yes that would be lovely."
"Joey";"You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!"
"Chandler";"Yes, you can pass for 19."
"Joey";"Really?"
"Chandler";"Yes!"
"Joey";"Seriously?"
"Chandler";"Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!"
"Joey";"(gasps) I’m 30!"
"Rachel";"Joey, you are not! You’re 31."
"Joey";"(realizes) Aww crap!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, so"
"Monica";"Y’know what? I-I think that umm, I don’t feel like going to"
"Phoebe";"Why?!"
"Rachel";"Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look…"
"Monica";"No-no, I-I really don’t want to talk about it! I don’t! (ToRachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)"
"Joey";"Psss, that is whack!"
"Phoebe";"(she’s strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I thinkI’ll play it at the wedding."
"Joey";"Yeah! Well, I think we’ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? Imean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and thenthey just take it away like-like, "No you don’t.""
"Phoebe";"Well, I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away."
"Joey";"Wouldn’t she?"
"Phoebe";"Would she?"
"Joey";"Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) Youate my candy bar!"
"Ross";"Guess who? (Enters fully.)"
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Ross";"Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air…"
"Rachel";"What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn’t want totalk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out therekissing."
"Ross";"Still thinking about it huh?"
"Rachel";"Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?(Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!"
"Ross";"(loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?"
"Rachel";"I care!"
"Ross";"(tightening his tie) And so do I."
"Rachel";"Y’know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just getchanged?"
"Ross";"Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)"
"Rachel";"Am I"
"Ross";"(sitting up) No! (Exits.)"
"Monica";"I can’t believe her, y’know it’s just—it’s sotypical."
"Chandler";"Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There isgoing to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and"
"Monica";"Paris?"
"Chandler";"We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something)."
"Monica";"Keep talking."
"Chandler";"Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not justbecause it’s romantic, but because I can!"
"Monica";"I love you!"
"Monica";"(in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur."
"Chandler";"Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away."
"Chandler";"It’s Paris, who knows we’re here!"
"Monica";"(opening the door) Hi Pheebs, what’s up? (She enters.)"
"Phoebe";"Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna needa small deposit."
"Monica";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date."
"Chandler";"Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)"
"Joey";"They break your heart, don’t they?"
"Phoebe";"Y’know, I don’t really their permission."
"Joey";"Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you… You gotta do somethingabout your eyes."
"Joey";"What?! What’s wrong with my eyes."
"Phoebe";"They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdomin there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes."
"Joey";"And that’ll get rid of my wisdom?"
"Phoebe";"Maybe just 10 minutes for you."
"Chandler";"Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!"
"Monica";"Yes."
"Rachel";"Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want totalk to anyone, especially me?"
"Chandler";"What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!"
"Rachel";"No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?"
"Monica";"Well, let’s just say it’s not the first time you’vestolen my thunder."
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Ross";"(To Rachel) Hey, here’s a thought."
"Rachel";"Monica, what are you talking about?"
"Monica";"My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousinCharlie."
"Chandler";"(entering) Ahh, third base."
"Monica";"It’s all everybody at the party could talk about!"
"Rachel";"Monica, y’know what? The only reason I did that was because yourparty was so boring!"
"Monica";"(gasps) We had a characturist!"
"Rachel";"Oh!!"
"Phoebe";"(singing, angrily)"
"Rachel";"Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago."
"Monica";"And yet, here we are doing it again."
"Rachel";"Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!"
"Monica";"Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!"
"Ross";"Got me. (He shows of his hands.)"
"Rachel";"All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonnahappen!"
"Monica";"I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!"
"Rachel";"I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!"
"Monica";"Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!"
"Ross";"Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us gettingtogether tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off."
"Chandler";"(To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man."
"Rachel";"(ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away fromyour night?"
"Monica";"I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a littleresentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’tstand the fact that your formally"
"Rachel";"Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what?Now I"
"Monica";"(yelling after them) I can’t believe you’re gonna have sex onmy engagement night!!"
"Chandler";"Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)"
"Ross";"Look uh, if we’re gonna do this…"
"Rachel";"We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna thinkthat we’re doin’ it."
"Ross";"Oh, I see, so everybody wins."
"Rachel";"Who is it?"
"Monica";"(outside the door) It’s Monica, open up!"
"Rachel";"Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him tofollow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)"
"Ross";"Oww!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) Maywe help you?"
"Monica";"I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope thatyou guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce yourengagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant!"
"Chandler";"How is that ever going to happen?!"
"Rachel";"All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!"
"Monica";"I know why!"
"Rachel";"No you"
"Monica";"Okay! Why?!"
"Rachel";"Because! Because I was sad."
"Monica";"What do you mean?"
"Rachel";"Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married justreminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know,maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but ohmy God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!"
"Chandler";"(To Ross) I don’t care, she slept with me."
"Rachel";"Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m"
"Monica";"(starting to cry) I’m sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.(They hug.)"
"Ross";"(deadpan) Well, I’m going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulationsman."
"Chandler";"Thanks."
"Ross";"(at the door) And uh, Rachel."
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Ross";"What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only personwho’s going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizeswhat he said and exits disgustedly.)"
"Phoebe";"(singing)"
"Chandler";"(interrupting her just in time) Hey! Here’s a dollar, consider ita deposit. Please sing at our wedding."
"Phoebe";"Oh thank you."
"Chandler";"Okay. (Goes back to bed.)"
"Phoebe";"Now… (Starts singing again) ""
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hi!"
"Joey";"Who wants French toast?"
"Ross";"Oh, I’ll have some!"
"Joey";"Good, me too. (Tosses him the loaf.) Eggs and milk are in the fridge.Thanks."
"Monica";"(entering from her room) Oww!"
"Chandler";"What’s the matter honey?"
"Monica";"I don’t know, my hand feels weird. I guess it’s because,I’m engaged! (Shows off the ring.) How long before it starts getting annoying?"
"Phoebe";"It starts?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, so let’s get started on the wedding plans!"
"Monica";"Okay! (Runs off.)"
"Chandler";"(incredulous) Already?!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, thecaterers, the music…"
"Chandler";"Oh, I got some thoughts on that."
"Rachel";"Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks…"
"Ross";"Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to saythe right name."
"Monica";"(returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3" 3-ring binder on the table.)"
"Chandler";"What in God’s name is that?!"
"Ross";"Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forthgrade!"
"Monica";"This baby has got everything. Take y’know, locations for instance.(She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, thengeographically, then by square footage."
"Phoebe";"That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break itoff now."
"Ross";"And"
"Phoebe";"Hey! Ross!"
"Ross";"Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?"
"Phoebe";"I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monicaand Chandler."
"Ross";"Oh my God! Of course, of course. (To the class.) Umm, would you pleaseexcuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other’s hometowns? Why don’tyou… (Motions that they should learn everyone’s hometown.) (To Phoebe)Wh-what’s going on?"
"Phoebe";"Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys justgot engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could Ijust move in with you for a couple days?"
"Ross";"Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?"
"Phoebe";"Nothing—Why?!"
"Ross";"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!"
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like fiveminutes."
"Ross";"Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?"
"Phoebe";"(to the students) Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone wantto come to the movies?"
"Monica";"All right, so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet, buttell me how this is for music."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Monica";"All right umm, a string quartet for the procession."
"Rachel";"Aw."
"Monica";"A jazz trio for cocktails. The"
"Chandler";"Well, you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t plan anymoreand Derrick… (Off of Rachel and Monica’s looks) And Derrick is a name Ishouldn’t know."
"Joey";"(sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds upone.) Y’know, something a little snugglyer?"
"Chandler";"Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?"
"Joey";"Well, the duck…"
"Rachel";"What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!"
"Joey";"Uh, well he did"
"Chandler";"Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who areactually"
"Monica";"Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!"
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Monica";"Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?"
"Chandler";"Centerpieces!"
"Monica";"Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.)"
"Chandler";"Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I justthink they’re a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.)But Lilies are the clear choice."
"Monica";"Oh my God! It’s like one mind."
"Chandler";"Uh-huh!"
"Joey";"(sitting up again) Guys! Guys!! You"
"Rachel";"Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!"
"Joey";"Yes it is perfectly good, and it is"
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Joey";"All right, I’m gonna go! (Gets up and heads for the door.)"
"Rachel";"Now Joey, what did the duck do?!"
"Joey";"I don’t know! But he did"
"Joey";"Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck does"
"Ross";"Uh, Phoebe…"
"Phoebe";"Oh Ross, hi."
"Ross";"Phoebe, what are you doing?"
"Phoebe";"I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now."
"Ross";"Phoebe!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, let’s talk outside."
"Ross";"Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment!"
"Phoebe";"What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!"
"Ross";"And they knew about it?"
"Phoebe";"(pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?"
"Ross";"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever Iwant!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. Ijust don’t know what the big deal is!"
"Ross";"The big deal is I don’t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartmentwhen I want to kick back with a puzzle—beer! Cold beer."
"Rachel";"Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing?"
"Joey";"Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?"
"Rachel";"No."
"Joey";"Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?"
"Rachel";"Joey, did"
"Joey";"Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours."
"Rachel";"Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?"
"Joey";"Where do you think, (pause) Zelda?"
"Rachel";"(gasps) You found my book?!"
"Joey";"Yeah I did!"
"Rachel";"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!"
"Joey";"Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know Ishouldn’t have, but you got porn!"
"Rachel";"Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of mybook. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just ahealthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (Shegoes into her room.)"
"Joey";"You got porn!"
"Ross";"Hello."
"Woman";"Hi, is uh Phoebe here?"
"Ross";"Uh no-no, she-she’s out for the night."
"Woman";"Ohh great."
"Ross";"Can I, can I help you with something?"
"Woman";"Well, I don’t know. Are you a masseur?"
"Ross";"(deadpan) Yes I am."
"Woman";"Great! (Calls down the hall) Dad! (Her old father walks in.) Thank you somuch, I’ll be back to pick him up in an hour. (She walks away.)"
"Mrs. Geller";"So Chandler, you’re parents must’ve been thrilled whenyou told them you were engaged."
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, I should probably call them."
"Mr. Geller";"I remember when we first got engaged."
"Chandler";"Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story."
"Monica";"Oh dad, really you don’t need to…"
"Mr. Geller";"(ignoring her) Well, I’d gotten Judy pregnant. I stilldon’t know that happened."
"Mrs. Geller";"(incredulous) You don’t know how that happened?! Your dogthought my diaphragm was a chew toy!"
"Chandler";"What a sweet story."
"Monica";"Well, at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at yourfifth grade Halloween party."
"Mr. Geller";"What?! They wanted a scary story!"
"Monica";"Anyway, we’re really excited about our wedding plans, and well Iguess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.(Chandler and her laugh, but her parents don’t.) What?"
"Mrs. Geller";"You tell her Jack, I can’t do it."
"Monica";"What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?"
"Mr. Geller";"We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house."
"Monica";"I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!"
"Mrs. Geller";"We’re sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got marriedafter you turned 30 you’d pay for it yourself."
"Monica";"You bought the beach house when I was 23!"
"Mr. Geller";"Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can’t puta price on that sweetie."
"Mrs. Geller";"We really do feel bad about this though."
"Mr. Geller";"We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then thatwent to hell, so we redid the kitchen."
"Monica";"What about when I started dating Chandler?"
"Mrs. Geller";"Well it was Chandler! We didn’t think"
"Chandler";"Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.(Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)"
"Monica";"I can’t believe it! That there is"
"Mrs. Geller";"We"
"Mr. Geller";"It seemed like such a simple idea."
"Mrs. Geller";"Stupid Jack, the word is stupid."
"Mr. Geller";"All right, enough! I don’t want to hear about it anymore!(Under his breath) Good luck, Chandler. (Chandler takes another drink.)"
"Ross";"Okay! Now, I’m going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh,that’s soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massagehim with those.)"
"Monica";"I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help payfor it?"
"Chandler";"I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourthwedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has hesaves for his yearly trips to (Pause)"
"Rachel";"Well what happened at dinner?"
"Monica";"My parents spent the money for our wedding!"
"Phoebe";"(gasps) My God! What did you order?!"
"Rachel";"Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys aregonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!"
"Chandler";"Honey, it’s gonna be okay."
"Monica";"No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swingband! No lilies!"
"Rachel";"No, y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’thave to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need, youdon’t need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear offthe rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)"
"Chandler";"Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we loveeach other and that we’re gonna get married."
"Rachel";"Do you even understand what off the rack means?!"
"Phoebe";"Look, why don’t you just pay for it yourself?"
"Monica";"How? I don’t have any money."
"Chandler";"Well, I have some."
"Monica";"How much?"
"Chandler";"Well, close to… (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides towrite it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)"
"Monica";"Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!"
"Rachel";"Well what?! How-how much is it?!"
"Monica";"It’s enough for wedding scenario eight."
"Rachel";"Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!"
"Monica";"(To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-theamount you have is"
"Rachel";"(starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other."
"Chandler";"Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on thewedding?"
"Rachel and Monica";"Ah, yeah!"
"Chandler";"Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and Ikinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party."
"Phoebe";"(reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr.Chandler."
"Monica";"This is the most special day of our lives."
"Chandler";"No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of themoney on one party."
"Monica";"Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding aparty one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could"
"Chandler";"Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answeris no."
"Monica";"You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?"
"Chandler";"Yes, I am!"
"Phoebe";"Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with."
"Joey";"Hey Rach."
"Rachel";"(quietly) Joey."
"Joey";"Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?"
"Rachel";"Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha."
"Joey";"No-no-no, I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s onfire."
"Rachel";"Well no, I don’t smell anything."
"Joey";"Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins."
"Ross";"(sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?"
"Rachel";"Nothing!"
"Ross";"(takes a drink) Damn, this coffee’s cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if Iheat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)"
"Rachel";"Y’know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!"
"Ross";"So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?"
"Rachel";"Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was withyou. (Exits.)"
"Ross";"(chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tonsof porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) ‘Sup?"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!"
"Ross";"(looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I’m sorry?"
"Phoebe";"My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guythat worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon."
"Ross";"(incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!"
"Phoebe";"He said you poked at him with wooden spoons."
"Ross";"Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give himaccu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with amop."
"Phoebe";"Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollarsa week!"
"Ross";"Hey, y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one thatdidn’t move his-his appointment."
"Phoebe";"Oh, it’s"
"Ross";"He said he liked that!! Oh you’re right, you’re right. I’msorry."
"Joey";"Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?"
"Ross";"His daughter was hot."
"Joey";"Gotcha."
"Monica";"Hey."
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Monica";"Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to askyou to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard forthat."
"Chandler";"Ehh."
"Monica";"Eh, you work for that."
"Chandler";"Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we shouldspend all of the money on the wedding."
"Monica";"You do?!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I toldyou that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makesyou happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do."
"Monica";"Oh, you’re so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what aboutour, what about the future and stuff?"
"Chandler";"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids,y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and"
"Monica";"You thought about that?"
"Chandler";"Yeah."
"Monica";"How many kids were we gonna have?"
"Chandler";"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
"Monica";"What else did you think about?"
"Chandler";"Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small placeoutside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know,we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time itran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garagewhere Joey could grow old."
"Monica";"(laughs) Y’know what? I-I don’t want a big, fancy wedding."
"Chandler";"Sure you do."
"Monica";"No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage."
"Chandler";"You sure?"
"Monica";"Uh-hmm."
"Chandler";"I love you so much."
"Monica";"I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you weretalkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right."
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, totally!"
"Monica";"Oh good."
"Joey";"Hello, Zelda."
"Rachel";"Who are you supposed to be?"
"Joey";"The vicar!"
"Rachel";"Do you even know what a vicar is?"
"Joey";"Like a goalie, right?"
"Rachel";"(sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, it’s enough all right?! You keepmaking these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s—I’mnot—it’s just not funny anymore!"
"Joey";"All right, I’m sorry. Rach I—Rach I’m sorry. Okay? I’msorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)"
"Rachel";"All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?!Let’s do it!"
"Joey";"Huh?"
"Rachel";"(starting to move closer to him) That’s right, I wanna do it withyou! I’ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things."
"Joey";"(nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)"
"Rachel";"(moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, I’ve been waitin’so long to get on that body!"
"Joey";"This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)"
"Rachel";"Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!"
"Joey";"Hey-hey, you’re startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wifethere in-in chapter seven."
"Rachel";"Oh, come on now, don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But,I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a"
"Joey";"I don’t want to, I’m scared."
"Chandler";"Hey, you guys!"
"Ross and Rachel";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"So, what do you think?"
"Ross";"About what?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, what?"
"Joey";"What?"
"Chandler";"Are you kidding? Okay, I’ll give you a hint; I’ll give you ahint. (Points to his glasses.)"
"Joey";"Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler’s eyes!"
"Chandler";"I got glasses!"
"Ross";"Well, you-you’ve always had glasses."
"Chandler";"No I didn’t!"
"Ross";"Are you sure?"
"Rachel";"Yeah-yeah, did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were reallyround, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm…"
"Joey";"Feminine."
"Rachel";"Yes!"
"Chandler";"No!"
"Monica";"Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy."
"Chandler";"Really?"
"Monica";"Yeah!"
"Chandler";"(sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didn’t think I used towear glasses, right?"
"Monica";"Of course! (She mouths, "I have no idea," to the rest of thegang.)"
"Phoebe";"So what do you guys want for an engagement present?"
"Chandler";"That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, soyou don’t have to get us…"
"Monica";"(interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we don’twant to deprive them of that joy."
"Rachel";"Oh, y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh,portable CD players."
"Monica";"Oh, I already have one."
"Phoebe";"Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist."
"Rachel";"Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey."
"Monica";"Hey, I know I what I want!"
"Chandler";"What"
"Monica";"No, you don’t want this. I want to have your grandmother’scookie recipe."
"Phoebe";"You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?"
"Monica";"Uh-huh, yeah."
"Phoebe";"You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed thatI would never let out of our family?"
"Chandler";"Dying people say the"
"Monica";"I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children."
"Phoebe";"Break my heart—Oh, all right."
"Monica";"Okay. I’m gonna be the mom that makes the world’s bestchocolate chip cookies."
"Chandler";"Our kids are gonna be"
"Joey";"(entering) Ahoy!"
"Chandler";"Hey! How’s the boat?!"
"Joey";"Great! I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff."
"Monica";"Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?"
"Joey";"Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!"
"Phoebe";"If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?"
"Joey";"Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hangaround, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinksa beer, and eats a chip.)"
"Chandler";"Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that."
"Rachel";"Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want."
"Joey";"You could?"
"Rachel";"Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dadbought me my own boat."
"Phoebe";"Your own boat?"
"Rachel";"What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick."
"Chandler";"Do you know what I was thinkin’?"
"Monica";"What?"
"Chandler";"Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)"
"Ross";"(entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?"
"Chandler";"Uh why, do you have a lecture?"
"Ross";"No, why?"
"Chandler";"Then free as a bird. What’s up?"
"Ross";"My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us."
"Monica";"Wow! That’s great! Dad must really like you, he doesn’t askjust anyone to play."
"Ross";"Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumedhe meant you."
"Chandler";"Well, did-did you correct him?"
"Ross";"No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way."
"Monica";"This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week."
"Ross";"Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals thetrash cans. He does that every week too."
"Monica";"Oh, just so you know, you-you"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Monica";"He"
"Chandler";"Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand."
"Ross";"You’re not a lefty?"
"Chandler";"Does anybody know me?!"
"Monica";"What’s wrong Phoebe?"
"Phoebe";"I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the"
"Monica";"No!! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof boxand keep it at"
"Phoebe";"(pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because I’m normal!That was the"
"Ross";"Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?"
"Chandler";"Don’t worry about it Pheebs."
"Ross";"No one got me an engagement present."
"Phoebe";"Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookiein a plastic baggie.)"
"Chandler";"An old cookie?"
"Monica";"(To Chandler) This is what happens when you don’t register forgifts!"
"Phoebe";"See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left."
"Chandler";"We can’t accept this."
"Phoebe";"Why not?"
"Chandler";"‘Cause it’s gross."
"Monica";"No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I dostuff like this at work all the time."
"Phoebe";"Really?!"
"Monica";"Yeah! I bet I can do it."
"Chandler";"Okay, we owe you a present."
"Ross";"Two! I’ve been engaged twice!"
"Joey";"(drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a biggerboat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (ToRachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?"
"Rachel";"That"
"Joey";"What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there.(Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)"
"Rachel";"Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with thelesson yet."
"Joey";"All right."
"Rachel";"Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time,are you ready?"
"Joey";"Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing, and Iwant to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them)Yo-ho-ho!"
"Rachel";"Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give alittle shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quickquestion though, (grabs some of the rigging) what’s this called?"
"Joey";"Uh, boat rope."
"Rachel";"Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?"
"Joey";"Uhh, rub it?"
"Rachel";"No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?"
"Joey";"I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know thisone, uh…"
"Rachel";"Time’s up, now your dead."
"Joey";"And deaf!"
"Rachel";"Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do notknow what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to yousailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)"
"Joey";"Yes."
"Rachel";"Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey you can really gethurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!"
"Joey";"I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler."
"Monica";"All right, I definitely taste nutmeg."
"Phoebe";"You do?"
"Monica";"You don’t? (Laughs) Well, that’s the difference between aprofessional and a layman."
"Phoebe";"That and arrogance."
"Joey";"(entering) Hey."
"Monica";"Hey! How was sailing?"
"Joey";"I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know, you could’ve atleast saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs what’s left of the cookie and pops in hismouth.)"
"Monica and Phoebe";"No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!"
"Joey";"(recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)"
"Phoebe";"I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of mygrandmother’s legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it outto Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage."
"Ross";"(entering with Chandler) Hey."
"Monica";"Hey! How was it?"
"Ross";"Well"
"Ross";"And what did he ask you not to call him?"
"Chandler";"Daddy. All right look, here’s the story. (Flashback to Chandlerabout to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finishedplaying racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it wasreally steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his wayaround the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses andthat’s when in happened."
"Chandler";"Guys?"
"Ross";"Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)"
"Mr. Geller";"Have a seat son. (You can see Mr. Geller sitting closer to the dooras Chandler walks over and sits in his lap.) Hey!! (Chandler quickly jumps off and sitsnext to him with a shocked expression on his face.)"
"Monica";"Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it!"
"Chandler";"I know."
"Monica";"You gave my father a lap dance!"
"Chandler";"Why do they put so much steam in there?!"
"Ross";"‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room."
"Chandler";"Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?"
"Phoebe";"Come on, it’s not that big a deal!"
"Chandler";"Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things."
"Ross";"Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have tobond to that part?"
"Monica";"Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thoughtthis was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!"
"Chandler";"I don’t want him to tell this story for years."
"Ross";"Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape fromfat camp."
"Monica";"I wasn’t escaping."
"Ross";"Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?"
"Monica";"I was trying to help out a squirrel."
"Ross";"You were trying to eat it!"
"Chandler";"If"
"Monica";"(takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens)I’m sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, I’ll call youlater dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)"
"Chandler";"(getting up) All right, I’m off to see your dad."
"Ross";"Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed?"
"Rachel";"(laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time."
"Chandler";"Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the storyanymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face Idon’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass. (Exits.)"
"Ross";"(To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?"
"Rachel";"I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything."
"Ross";"Thank you!"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey."
"Ross";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Well hello! So, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey?"
"Joey";"Oh uh, I don’t know the boat way to say this, but uh never!"
"Rachel";"Why not?"
"Joey";"Because! You’re mean on the boat!"
"Rachel";"What? I was just trying to teach you."
"Joey";"Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!"
"Ross";"Yeeeeeep… Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on herdad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all."
"Rachel";"Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your armsbecause you were wearing three life jackets."
"Ross";"You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)"
"Rachel";"Look Joey, I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gottatell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me allthe time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher."
"Joey";"Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?""
"Rachel";"Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?"
"Joey";"Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!"
"Joey";"Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I hadfinished that last beer."
"Rachel";"All right, y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone itdown and uh stop yelling."
"Joey";"You won’t boss me around anymore?"
"Rachel";"I won’t boss you around."
"Joey";"And you’ll be nice?"
"Rachel";"And, I’ll be nice."
"Joey";"And you’ll be topless?"
"Rachel";"And—Joey!"
"Joey";"Do you want me to learn?!"
"Monica";"Okay, here’s batch 22. Ohh, maybe these’ll taste a little likeyour grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg."
"Ross";"Let’s give it a shot."
"Monica";"Okay. Man, I have"
"Phoebe";"Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?"
"Monica";"No, just a Friday night."
"Ross";"Ohh, these are pretty good."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but not as good as batch 17."
"Ross";"Which one was that?"
"Monica";"The ones we had right after you almost threw up."
"Ross";"Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did"
"Phoebe";"Are there anymore from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just workoff of those."
"Ross";"Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh… (Grabs acookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesn’t like it.) It’s batch 16! 16people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)"
"Rachel";"Okay Joey honey, you’re doing really good! All right, now I’mjust gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember whichside is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?"
"Joey";"Ohh yeah."
"Rachel";"Right?"
"Joey";"Nope."
"Rachel";"It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s atough one."
"Joey";"I don’t know why you just don’t say left."
"Rachel";"Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side ofthe boat.) The left!"
"Joey";"Huh?"
"Rachel";"(yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)"
"Joey";"(hurrying over) Okay! Okay, you’re yelling again! See that?"
"Rachel";"No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling."
"Joey";"Oh, y’know what? Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have mea little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)"
"Rachel";"Okay Joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up thecunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped workingefficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)"
"Joey";"Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there."
"Rachel";"Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)"
"Joey";"Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overheadwith the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!"
"Rachel";"(angrily) No! All right?! I did"
"Joey";"All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see youtaking your top off! I quit!"
"Rachel";"What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!"
"Joey";"Why not?!"
"Rachel";"Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens donot quit!"
"Joey";"Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!"
"Rachel";"Oh my God, wait did I—I just said Greens don’t quitdidn’t I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens don’t quit?!"
"Joey";"Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me!"
"Rachel";"No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you.Oh God Joey, ohh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying sohard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry.I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn."
"Joey";"Well, hey I did learn."
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Joey";"Yeah! Come on."
"Rachel";"Awww…"
"Joey";"Yeah, it’s okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. It’sthe larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port isright."
"Rachel";"Left."
"Joey";"Damnit!"
"Phoebe";"Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy toknow that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ upat us and smiling right now."
"Ross";"Looking up?"
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah—No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell forsure."
"Monica";"Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonnabe the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duckconfit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right."
"Ross";"Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have therecipe? What about, what about your sister?"
"Phoebe";"Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talkto Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15"
"Ross";"That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve gotshuffleboard that day."
"Phoebe";"That’s what you think."
"Monica";"Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s?Wouldn’t they have the recipe?"
"Phoebe";"Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. Mygrandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse."
"Monica";"What was her name?"
"Phoebe";"Nesele Toulouse."
"Phoebe";"Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language."
"Monica";"(grabbing a bag of"
"Phoebe";"(reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Ohh."
"Monica";"I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figureout the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!"
"Phoebe";"I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down)you’re burning in hell!!"
"Chandler";"So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if youdidn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little…I’m alittle embarrassed about it."
"Mr. Geller";"I understand completely, there’s nothing more horrifying thanembarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started datingJudy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him Iwas a lawyer."
"Chandler";"What did you do when they found out?"
"Mr. Geller";"They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nodalong. Shall we?"
"Chandler";"So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!"
"Rachel";"Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun."
"Joey";"Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don’t you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)"
"Rachel";"Ohh we’re not sailing."
"Joey";"Just pull on it."
"Rachel";"All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.)Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees what’s in the cooler.) Sandwiches!"
"Joey";"What else?"
"Rachel";"(hands him one) Here you go."
"Joey";"Thank you."
"Rachel";"Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that thestuff falls out.)"
"Joey";"What are you doing?"
"Rachel";"Ohh, sorry."
"Joey";"What you—don’t hold it like that! You’re lettin’ allthe good stuff fall out."
"Rachel";"Ohh whoops."
"Joey";"Careful! You’re wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! I’m"
"Mac";"(on TV) Well, if we learned one thing today C.H.E.E.S.E. is thatcheerleaders and high explosives don’t mix. (Cut to Joey laughing while Rachel,Chandler, and Monica aren’t amused.)"
"C.H.E.E.S.E";"You can say that again Mac."
"Mac";"Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius."
"C.H.E.E.S.E";"Oh yeah? Well then how come I can’t get my VCR to stopblinking 12:00?"

"Ross";"Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course herex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. Now, if you’ll excuse me…"
"Phoebe";"(interrupting him) No listen to me! She is"

"Rachel";"Wo-women? You mean like old women?"
"Tag";"Well kinda old, like 30."
"Rachel";"(Pause) Oh."

"Joey";"What?"
"Rachel";"Y’know, all the women."
"Joey";"Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know,that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler."

"Joey";"I know, Monica told me."
"Chandler";"Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?"
"Rachel";"Yeah. Sure. (Joey nods his head questioningly and Rachel nods no.)"
"Chandler";"Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get theirattention.)"
"Rachel";"(To Joey) So, will you talk to him?"
"Joey";"I don’t know Rach."
"Rachel";"Oh, come on! I’ll give you ten free"
"Joey";"One! (Pause.) No ten! You said ten! You can’t take that back!"
"Tag";"Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?"

"Tag";"Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel."
"Joey";"Ten. Okay. Now Tag there’s such a thing as to many women."
"Tag";"Really?"
"Joey";"Yeah, for you!"
"Monica";"(seeing him approach) Hey! There you are!"
"Chandler";"There I am!"
"Monica";"Are you okay?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me anantihistamine."
"Monica";"What?!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way toBrooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!"
"Monica";"Chandler, what were you thinking?"
"Chandler";"I don’t know, but don’t worry, don’t worry, because Iknow how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), lookdown, look down… (He falls asleep.)"

"Phoebe";"So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?"
"Ross";"Listen, you are hearing"
"Phoebe";"Yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decoratingand a little more time in the bedroom."
"Ross";"Well, I don’t think"
"Phoebe";"You think he’s emotionally unavailable?"
"Ross";"I think he can be."
"Phoebe";"Well, maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t bring the office homeevery night!"
"Ross";"Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year’s Eve1997."

"Tag";"Went out with Joey."
"Rachel";"Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?"
"Tag";"No. We had a really good talk. I don’t think I’m gonna do thatbar scene anymore."
"Rachel";"Wow! I did not see that coming."
"Tag";"It’s just not really who I am. Y'know, I’ve always been happierwhen…Why am I telling you this? You don’t care about this stuff."
"Rachel";"Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were sayingI am happier when uh, y’know?"
"Tag";"When I’m in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend."
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Tag";"Someone I can spoil, y’know?"
"Rachel";"Sp-spoil?"
"Tag";"Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?"
"Rachel";"Uh-huh."
"Tag";"Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?"
"Rachel";"Well, I-I’m startin’ too."
"Tag";"And if that person is already in your life, you should do something aboutit right?"
"Rachel";"Yes! Hell yes!"
"Tag";"All right then, it’s settled."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Tag";"I’m gettin’ back together with my ex-girlfriend."

"Tag";"What?"
"Rachel";"(panics, turns around, picks up the phone, and pretend to talk on it)Hello?! (Listens) Oh, yeah! (To Tag) This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. (Tag leaves andshe closes the door behind him, disgustedly.) Yeah!"
"Ross";"My God!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfishin bed, how’s Whitney?"
"Ross";"Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone elseknew where everything was!"
"Phoebe";"Oh he knows! (Quietly) For the most part."
"Kyle";"Oh hey! Good, you’re both here."
"Whitney";"We kinda need to talk."
"Phoebe";"Both of you together?"
"Ross";"Wh-what’s up?"
"Whitney";"Well, I went over to Kyle’s last night to pick up a few things andwe got to reminiscing…"
"Kyle";"…we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reasonwe were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So…(Pause)"
"Ross";"Oh just say it Kyle!"
"Kyle";"We’re gonna give it another try."
"Phoebe";"What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!"
"Whitney";"I’m gonna work on that."
"Phoebe";"Oh right, because you’re so capable of change."
"Ross";"(To Whitney) Y’know, he hums when he pees!"
"Whitney";"I do know."
"Ross";"It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever."
"Whitney";"We’re so sorry. (They get up to leave.)"
"Ross";"That’s all right, we-we don’t need you. In fact, hey I’mover it already."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass."
"Kyle";"Yeah, we’re gonna go. (They leave.)"
"Ross";"(To Phoebe) I’m sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right abouther. Y’know, she"
"Phoebe";"Oh. Y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to."
"Ross";"Yeah, were better off without them."
"Phoebe";"And y’know, even if they break up again, you’d better not lethim in your sad men’s club!"
"Ross";"Divorced men’s club."
"Phoebe";"Potato, Potaato. (She’s pronounces potato with the both the shortand long As.)"
"Monica";"Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh, let’s see it!"
"Chandler";"Ahhh."
"Monica";"Okay. (She opens it up and shows it to them.)"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, that looks good."
"Phoebe";"You guys make a"
"Joey";"Yeah, we look great together."
"Monica";"Yeah, we"
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Monica";"Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!"
"Joey";"Y’know, we don’t have to imagine."
"Chandler";"I’m marrying her."
"Joey";"We’ll just see."
"Monica";"Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because Ihave been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I reallyhope it’s you!"
"Phoebe";"I hope it’s you."
"Rachel";"Me too!"
"Monica";"First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both soimportant to me…"
"Rachel";"Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!"
"Monica";"Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system wherewe trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe weremine…"
"Phoebe";"Yes!!! Oh!!"
"Rachel";"Hypothetically!"
"Phoebe";"Still."
"Monica";"If Phoebe were my maid of honor…"
"Rachel";"Uh-hmm."
"Monica";"Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we allget to do it once and no one would get upset."
"Rachel";"Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?"
"Monica";"(laughs) Well that’s the best part. Umm,"
"Phoebe";"Wh-why is that the best part?"
"Monica";"Because then I don’t have to!"
"Rachel";"Well of"
"Monica";"I’m really not deciding!"
"Rachel";"Fine!"
"Woman";"Excuse me, I-I couldn’t help overhearing, you’re marrying ChandlerBing?"
"Monica";"Yeah that’s right."
"Woman";"(sarcastically) Huh, good luck!"
"Phoebe";"Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!"

"Joey";"What are you talking about? Bitch."
"Phoebe";"Hey Rachel?"

"Phoebe";"Oh! Well, if that’s what you want…"
"Rachel";"Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s!"
"Phoebe";"But why does it even matter?!"
"Rachel";"Why does it matter so much to you?!"
"Phoebe";"Because"
"Rachel";"What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?"
"Phoebe";"(gasps) You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want todo this, but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’vedone it at least twice!"

"Joey";"Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later."
"Ross";"Okay. But not about this!"
"Joey";"No! Never! Never! (Pause, then Joey wants to shake Ross’s hand.) Bye."
"Ross";"No touch! No touch!"
"Monica";"Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This womanoverheard that I was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck."
"Chandler";"That’s sweet."

"Chandler";"So uh, what did this woman look like?"
"Monica";"She was like 30, dark hair, attractive."
"Chandler";"Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thingcalled a mirror?"
"Monica";"Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?"
"Chandler";"No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both notattractive… (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (Hegets up and grabs a photo album."

"Monica";"Well, apparently she does."
"Chandler";"Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is notamused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me."
"Joey";"Hey! What’s going on?"
"Rachel";"Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!"
"Joey";"Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for thatgirl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)"
"Rachel";"(shocked)"
"Phoebe";"See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie!"
"Rachel";"All right that’s it!"
"Phoebe";"Na-uh,"
"Rachel";"How come you are?!"
"Phoebe";"Because I cared enough to lie!"
"Joey";"Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we couldhave like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor typesituations."
"Phoebe";"What are you talking about?"
"Joey";"Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best ofthe people they see, they give me the part."
"Phoebe";"Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?"
"Joey";"Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges."
"Phoebe";"(To Rachel) Well, it’s better than us deciding."
"Rachel";"Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!"
"Phoebe";"No! Coins hate me!"
"Rachel";"Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.(Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie."
"Phoebe";"Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)"
"Ross";"Wow, this cologne really"
"Joey";"Hi."
"Ross";"Just uh, brought back your videos."
"Joey";"Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before."
"Ross";"No! No we don’t!"
"Joey";"Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!"
"Ross";"I… I don’t know what you are talking about."
"Joey";"Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!"
"Ross";"I’ve had better."
"Joey";"Okay! When?!"
"Ross";"All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!"
"Joey";"Uh-huh!"
"Ross";"I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!"
"Joey";"I want to do it again."
"Ross";"We"
"Joey";"Why not?"
"Ross";"Because it’s weird!"
"Joey";"Fine! Do you want something to drink?"
"Ross";"Sure, what do you got?"
"Joey";"Warm milk and"
"Monica";"Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who youare!"
"Chandler";"Can you figure out what I’m doing?"
"Monica";"You’re Lewis Posin."
"Chandler";"Who?"
"Monica";"Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one dayI asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?"
"Chandler";"Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to thebathroom?!"
"Monica";"No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa…. (Chandler emerges,without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad asI did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie."
"Chandler";"What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago."
"Monica";"No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewisapologized to me."
"Chandler";"Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a betterperson and that is"
"Joey";"Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonnagive you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to10, 1 being the highest."
"Ross";"No, 10 is the highest."
"Joey";"Why is 10 the highest?"
"Ross";"Because it’s the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachelyou’re up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1: You’re withMonica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing thepart of Monica.)"
"Joey";"(crying) I don’t want to marry Chandler!"
"Rachel";"Okay, uh…"
"Joey";"I’ve got cold feet."
"Rachel";"…it’s gonna be okay!"
"Joey";"No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it!This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!"
"Rachel";"Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know,it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to rememberthat you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep thegifts."
"Joey";"(out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, Ilike that!"
"Rachel";"Thanks!"
"Ross";"Yes, very nice Rachel."
"Rachel";"Thank you judges."
"Phoebe";"Ugh, what a kiss ass."
"Rachel";"Oh!"
"Joey";"Okay, Phoebe…"
"Phoebe";"Yes! Your honor?"
"Joey";"We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do"when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!"
"Ross";"(playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I rememberthat—(Phoebe screams and tackles him)—Ooh!! Ow! Very good!"
"Phoebe";"Oh!"
"Joey";"Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!"
"Rachel";"Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!"
"Phoebe";"Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!"
"Ross";"It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech."
"Rachel";"Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…"
"Ross";"Go!"
"Rachel";"Okay! Okay! Umm,"
"Ross and Joey";"Oh! That’s nice."
"Rachel";"Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately andI’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you aretruly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holdsit up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upontogether. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey."
"Joey";"Wow. (To Ross) Good speech."
"Ross";"Yeah, it really was!"
"Rachel";"Aw, thanks!"
"Ross";"Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next (To Joey) although I reallydon’t see the point."
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.(Raises her glass and drinks.)"
"Joey";"And she’s back in the game."
"Chandler";"(she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you rememberme."
"Julie";"Hello Skidmark."
"Chandler";"(To Monica) It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later."
"Monica";"It’s pretty clear."
"Chandler";"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have brokenup with you because you were overweight."
"Julie";"That’s why you broke up with me?"
"Chandler";"You-you-you didn’t know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, Iguess my work here is done!"
"Joey";"All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performedvery well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say thatin this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!"
"Phoebe";"Really?! I won!"
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Ross";"I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close."
"Rachel";"Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where I’ve heard thatbefore.)"
"Ross";"Actually, it wasn’t that close."
"Rachel";"No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this wasridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips thecoin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)"
"Phoebe";"The coins have finally forgiven me!"
"Rachel";"Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her,her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)"
"Phoebe";"(running after her) Rach, it’s gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey)You guys are the best!"
"Joey";"Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me."
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Joey";"Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap onmy couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)"
"Ross";"Why-why would I care about that?"
"Joey";"No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’llbe."
"Chandler";"As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’mgoing to apologize for all of the stupid things I do."
"Monica";"Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’thave to apologize."
"Chandler";"I would really love it if could do both."
"Monica";"All right, I…I have to ask."
"Chandler";"What?"
"Monica";"Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?"
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Monica";"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she havegained?"
"Chandler";"A hundred and forty-five pounds."
"Monica";"In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s notthe point."
"Chandler";"Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but Iwas 15!"
"Monica";"Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You rememberwhen umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat."
"Chandler";"Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different."
"Monica";"How?"
"Chandler";"You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!"
"Monica";"What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different.I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!"
"Chandler";"Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin,beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologizefor later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica."
"Monica";"Keep going."
"Chandler";"So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still loveyou."
"Monica";"Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?"
"Chandler";"I’d carry you around in my pocket."
"Monica";"I love you. (They hug and kiss.)"
"Chandler";"Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies."
"Rachel";"Hi Pheebs."
"Phoebe";"Hi!"
"Rachel";"Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby."
"Phoebe";"That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks ather.) Oh, you mean today."
"Rachel";"Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’knowI was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get tobe yours."
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah!"
"Rachel";"Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I startedputting some stuff together, y’know just in case…"
"Phoebe";"Oh that’s so sweet thanks."
"Rachel";"Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God thisis funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (ShowsPhoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was"
"Phoebe";"Ohh."
"Rachel";"And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry atweddings. (Starting to cry.) I’m just gonna grab a couple of these."
"Phoebe";"This stuff is great!"
"Rachel";"Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I wassaving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’sblue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah…"
"Phoebe";"Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s madeof honor."
"Rachel";"You do? Why?"
"Phoebe";"Because I think it means more to you."
"Rachel";"But Pheebs, y’know you earned it."
"Phoebe";"Its fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking aboutsince you were what, 14? (She’s referring to the Halloween picture.)"
"Rachel";"No, I was ten. I just developed early."
"Phoebe";"(looking at the picture again) Man alive!"
"Monica";"(entering) Hey, what’s going on?"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor."
"Monica";"(gasps) Ohh, wow! That’s great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! Wereally have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We shouldprobably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we’llget together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I’m so excited! (Runs outleaving Rachel completely stunned and Phoebe laughing.)"
"Rachel";"Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna be yours. (Phoebe getssuddenly scared.)"
"Joey";"Great nap."
"Ross";"It really was."
"Joey";"(reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!(Heads for his room leaving Ross.)"
"Ross";"(slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)"
"Joey";"Morning!"
"Rachel";"Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?"
"Joey";"Pretty good."
"Rachel";"Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds anaked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confrontsJoey.)"
"Joey";"Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I’m late for work."
"Rachel";"What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!"
"Joey";"Yeah—Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And heylisten, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’mnot looking for a serious relationship; that’d be great."
"Rachel";"Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!"
"Joey";"Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh,I’m a loner—No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up withthe likes of me."
"Rachel";"Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember, can’t I just tellher you’re a pig?"
"Joey";"Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used todo it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave‘em for me."
"Rachel";"Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not myresponsibility."
"Joey";"Fine! (Pause) Now, where’d we land on those pancakes? (She chases himout the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)"
"Joey’s Date";"Hi!"
"Rachel";"Hi."
"Joey’s Date";"Sorry about that, but I couldn’t get that lock to work onthe door."
"Rachel";"Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in."
"Joey’s Date";"You must be Rachel, I’m Erin."
"Rachel";"Hi."
"Erin";"Hi. I don’t mean this to sound like high school, but did he sayanything about me?"
"Rachel";"(pause) Would you like some pancakes?"
"Chandler";"…Come on! Why are we here?!"
"Ross";"Okay, okay take a guess."
"Chandler";"The hot chicks?"
"Ross";"Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier,y’know-y’know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoraldissertation! It’s here! Yeah, it’s right-it’s right down here! In thebiggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secludedsection behind the racks.)"
"Chandler";"Wow that’s actually pretty cool."
"Ross";"(stopping quickly) Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman namedWendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the nextaisle.) What is that?"
"Chandler";"Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system."
"Female Student";"(as they are moving past Ross) I’m so sorry!"
"Male Student";"Sorry!"
"Chandler";"You didn’t bring me here to do that, did you?"
"Monica";"She sent the chicken back again?!"
"The Waitress";"She says it’s to dry now and she wants to come back here andexplain to you"
"Monica";"Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!"
"that";"that"
"The Colonel";"OH…MY…GAWD!!!! (Yep, it’s Janice.)"
"Monica";"(to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns aroundto face the planet’s most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford ofcourse. She’s the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice."
"Janice";"How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with thebest chicken ever! (Does the laugh.)"
"Monica";"I’m fine."
"Janice";"(notices Monica’s engagement ring) Ohh! What is that on yourfinger?! I’m blind!"
"Monica";"Oh… Uh…"
"Janice";"So, who’s the lucky guy?"
"Chandler";"OH…MY…GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? Youdidn’t tell her we were getting married, did you?"
"Monica";"Well, she saw the ring."
"Chandler";"Did she freak out?"
"Monica";"Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were mostpeople."
"Chandler";"Right."
"Monica";"Well, she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself, named Clark. Uh,she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too."

"Monica";"Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won’t be so bad."
"Chandler";"What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? Youdon’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’sgonna want to grab the microphone and sing"
"Monica";"Oh my God, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either isshe?!"
"Chandler";"Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what?She’s probably not gonna even want to come."
"Monica";"Really?"
"Chandler";"No! That was a"
"Monica";"So-so you would’ve just lied?"
"Chandler";"Yes!!"
"Monica";"Would it really have been that easy?"
"Chandler";"Yes!!!"
"Monica";"Good, so do it Saturday night because we’re going to dinner withher and Clark."
"Joey";"Hey! What’s up?"

"Erin";"Hey Joey!"
"Joey";"Erin! Still here!"

"Phoebe";"We want you to marry her!"
"Joey";"What?!!"
"Phoebe";"She is so amazing! You have no idea."
"Joey";"No idea? Who do you think brought her here?"
"Rachel";"Cupid."
"Phoebe";"Joey, she’s so cool. She speaks four languages."
"Joey";"Man, do"
"Rachel";"Look Joey, come on she’s so perfect for you! I mean she’ssweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch."
"Joey";"My beers?! Look you guys, she’s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a goodtime, but I just—I don’t see it going anywhere."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but you always say that."
"Rachel";"Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere."
"Joey";"Look I’m sorry you guys, I-I just don’t think so."
"Phoebe";"Whatever."
"Rachel";"Fine. (They start to walk away.)"
"Joey";"Hey, don’t start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? You’re the onewho’s in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, you’re the onehaving the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!"
"Rachel";"Phoebe!"
"Ross";"People are doing it in front of my book!"
"Rachel";"I’m sorry?"
"Ross";"My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it,and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontologysection!"
"Rachel";"Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?"
"Ross";"Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place oncampus where students went to uh, fool around."
"Rachel";"Yeah, there was. It was—there the corner of the library where-whereall these dusty books that nobody ever read—Yes, there was."
"Ross";"Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it’s like uh-a thing!"
"Joey";"Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?"
"Ross";"Oh for cryin’ out loud! (He storms out.)"
"Joey";"All right, so we should go catch our movie."
"Rachel";"Well now what’s the rush?"
"Joey";"I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy."
"Phoebe";"(entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!"
"Rachel";"Well look who’s here!"
"Erin";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Erin";"Joey."
"Joey";"Erin."
"Erin";"Hey Rachel."
"Rachel";"Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!"
"Erin";"What’s wrong?"
"Rachel";"Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to."
"Phoebe";"Oh no."
"Joey";"(skeptical) What party?"
"Phoebe and Rachel";"A birthday party."
"Joey";"Who’s birthday party?"
"Phoebe and Rachel";"Allison’s birthday party."
"Joey";"(still skeptical) Oh, and how is Allison?"
"Phoebe and Rachel";"32. (Joey’s not buying it.)"
"Rachel";"(does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why don’t you guys dosomething?!"
"Joey";"(still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out."
"Ross";"Excuse me. Hi, I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontologysection, fifth floor, stack 437?"
"The Librarian";"Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someoneto cover my shift."
"Ross";"No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarianbrings his boss over.)"
"The Head Librarian";"How can I help you?"
"Ross";"Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in thePaleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it peopleare-are-are well, rolling around in front of it."
"The Head Librarian";"We are aware of the problem you are referring too. (He turnsto look at the previous librarian.) But as far as increasing security, I’m afraid thelibrary is very understaffed. I, I can’t help you."
"Ross";"Well, fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation ofthe sanctity of the written word, I’ll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts todo so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And don’t you follow me!"
"Joey";"Hey."
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"How did it go with Erin?"
"Joey";"Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!"
"Phoebe";"Yay!! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore?"
"Joey";"No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than thefirst time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous."
"Phoebe";"Didn’t you sleep together?"
"Joey";"Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She lovessandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were everto have kids, well that’s a…"
"Rachel";"(gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin’ about having kids. Oh myJoey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please don’t get married before I do."
"Joey";"Okay."
"Janice";"Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!"
"Monica";"He might still show up."
"Janice";"Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours."
"Monica";"Is that all?"
"Janice";"I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t youtell about your lovely wedding?"
"Chandler";"Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about thewedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even surewhy we’re having it."
"Monica";"It’s actually going to be just family."
"Janice";"Oh…wait…you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask yousomething now and be honest; do you want me to sing"
"Joey";"How can you say that?! The"
"Erin";"What about Benitez?"
"Joey";"What about Game 1 of the Series?"
"Erin";"What about shut up?"
"Joey";"You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin)I’ll be right back."
"Erin";"Okay. (Joey goes to get some coffee and Erin sits down.)"
"Rachel";"So how’s it goin’ with Joey?"
"Erin";"Uh, okay."
"Rachel";"Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell methat you like him."
"Erin";"Look, he’s a really great guy and I know that"
"Rachel";"But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya justchange your mind?!"
"Erin";"Kinda."
"Phoebe";"Then change it back!"
"Erin";"I’m sorry I… It’s just there’s no real spark."
"Phoebe";"No spark? Didn’t you sleep together?"
"Erin";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Ugh, tramp!"
"Phoebe";"Does Joey have any idea?"
"Erin";"I really don’t think he does. And y’know what? Maybe you guyscould help clue him in. Y’know, tell him I’m-I’m not interested in aserious relationship or something."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, you mean like that you’re kind of a loner."
"Erin";"Yeah! That would be great!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, and maybe that you’re a real (She says something in Italian,and it doesn’t matter what she said. It’s not important so I don’t needeveryone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)"
"Erin";"I’m sorry?"
"Phoebe";"Oh well, I guess Italian isn’t one of the four languages you speak."
"Joey";"(returning) Hey! You wanna go?"
"Erin";"Yeah, let’s go."
"Joey";"Okay. See you guys later."
"Erin";"Bye guys."
"Rachel";"Yeah, see ya."
"Joey";"(whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)"
"Rachel";"Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here."
"Phoebe";"No, just a regular old flying dwarf."
"Ross";"Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?"
"Guy";"Yeah, we were…we were just looking around."
"Ross";"Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were youlooking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. ChesterStock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?"
"Guy";"Uhh…."
"Ross";"Ah… Ah…Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross startslooking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into thesection.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s viewson evolution?"
"Woman";"Uh, actually I find Marion’s views far to progressionist."
"Ross";"I find Marion’s views far to progressionist."
"Woman";"I’m sorry, who are you?"
"Ross";"I’m a professor here uh, Ross…Geller."
"Woman";"Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It’s uh—Wait! (Grabs hisbook off of the shelf.) Did you write this?"
"Ross";"Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!"
"Woman";"Y’know, you look nothing like I would’ve thought.You’re…you’re so young."
"Ross";"Well I uh, I skipped forth grade."
"Ross";"I am very…very sorry."
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"So how was, how was your date?"
"Joey";"Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to thisice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still… And guess what, I’mthinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts."
"Phoebe";"Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?"
"Joey";"No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise, but it’s gonna be trickythought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while."
"Phoebe and Rachel";"Oh no, yeah."
"Rachel";"Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got thefeeling from her today that uh, she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship."
"Joey";"Where are you gettin’ this?"
"Rachel";"Well, she told me. She said she’s kinda a loner."
"Joey";"Oh. Oh."
"Rachel";"Joey…"
"Joey";"No hey Rach, it’s cool okay? Y’know I’m a loner too! (Headsfor his room.) Right?"
"Phoebe";"Hey Joey, y’know what? You are way to good for her."
"Rachel";"Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye andtell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship."
"Joey";"No! No. Don’t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me."
"Rachel";"Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?"
"Joey";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"Do you want some pancakes?"
"Joey";"(coming back out) Finally!"
"Monica";"What are we gonna do?"
"Chandler";"I say we go with"
"Janice";"Chandler?"
"Chandler";"(To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?"
"Monica";"Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?"
"Janice";"Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then Ijust felt I couldn’t really be alone tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open doorbehind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I waswondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be withfamily."
"Monica";"(To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they?"
"Janice";"Please, it’s because otherwise I really don’t know what Imight do."
"Chandler";"Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?"
"Janice";"(starting to cry) Do you have any tissues?"
"Monica";"Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom."
"Janice";"Okay! (She runs for the bathroom)"
"Monica";"We’ll just…we’ll just let her stay."
"Chandler";"No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay"
"Monica";"Kinda like your Barca lounger."
"Chandler";"Is that what you’re thinking about right now?"
"Monica";"I"
"Janice";"Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before Itake my bath."
"Chandler";"Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight."
"Janice";"Why not?"
"Chandler";"Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. NowMonica and I have been immunized, but sadly"
"Janice";"Okay, I’m going to need a comforter, but did you have ahypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do youhave a cat? ‘Cause it’s already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hearthat? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)"
"Monica";"Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!"
"Janice";"Why?"
"Monica";"Because Chandler still has feelings for you!"
"Janice";"He does?"
"Chandler";"Say again?"
"Monica";"That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’tstay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding."
"Chandler";"Feelings, such strong feelings."
"Monica";"I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but"
"Janice";"Oh…my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I’ll go. (Startsfor the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)"
"Ross";"(to the guard) Don’t sweat it, I’ve got this section covered.Yeah, in fact I’ve got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine inpeople’s eye—(The guard walks away)—Okay, see you later."
"Chandler";"I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)"
"Ross";"(entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!"
"Chandler";"No, no, no. No-no-no."
"Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe";"Shhhh!"
"Ross";"What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?"
"Chandler";"No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name allthe states in six minutes."
"Ross";"What? That's like insanely easy!"
"Chandler";"Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at leastone, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica)."
"Monica";"It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, sotechnically I didn't lose."
"Ross";"What? You forgot fourteen states?"
"Monica";"Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (That’s true in so many ways, trustme, I’ve lived in one and been to the other.)"
"Chandler";"Oh, okay, time's up!"
"Rachel";"All right, I got 48."
"Chandler";"Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types ofcelery, and I have one: regular celery."
"Chandler";"Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables,Joey?"
"Joey";"Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game."
"Ross";"Wow, how many have you got?"
"Joey";"Fifty-six!"
"Joey";"Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!"
"Chandler";"Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list)There you go."
"Rachel";"(counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting?"
"Monica";"'Cause you invited your assistant."
"Rachel";"Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town,so he's spending Thanksgiving with her."
"Monica";"Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potatostuffed pumpkin."
"Rachel";"Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is sodelicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things."
"Monica";"Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) butI still do."
"Phoebe";"Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already havethat. (She gets up and heads for her room)"
"Ross";"Done! With time a-to-spare."
"Chandler";"Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks upRoss' pad)"
"Ross";"You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that agroup of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map,or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?"
"Chandler";"Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)"
"Ross";"What? That's impossible."
"Joey";"46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?"
"Monica";"All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please,watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!"
"Chandler";"I am only"
"Ross";"No, just give me another minute."
"Chandler";"Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them,okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself."
"Ross";"This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50before dinner."
"Chandler";"Okay, but if you can't…no dinner!"
"Ross";"You're on!"
"Joey";"(gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot onthere that you don't have."
"Monica";"(entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know, that your ovendoesn't work?"
"Joey";"But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?"
"Monica";"Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?"
"Ross";"Pshhshhh!"
"Monica";"Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket)"
"Chandler";"Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globein your apartment."
"Joey";"Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States."
"Phoebe";"Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk."
"Ross";"Phoebe, why is your bag moving?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, it's not!"
"Rachel";"Seriously, it's moving!"
"Joey";"What the hell is in there?"
"Phoebe";"It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe'sbag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good."
"Monica";"Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here moreoften?"
"Chandler";"I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's likeold pumpkins or something."
"Monica";"That's my pie!"
"Chandler";"Which smells delicious!"
"Monica";"Uh-oh! Uh-oh!"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Monica";"We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looksout) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!"
"Phoebe";"(answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?"
"Monica";"Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?"
"Phoebe";"I'm sorry, who's this?"
"Monica";"Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!"
"Chandler";"Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!"
"Phoebe";"No, there's no dog here?"
"Monica";"Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monica’sapartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand."
"Phoebe";"Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)"
"Monica";"I'll be right there!"
"Phoebe";"(Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They'rehere already? How are they doing this?"
"Rachel";"(gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here?"
"Tag";"I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is stillgood."
"Rachel";"Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to yourgirlfriend?"
"Tag";"We kinda broke up this morning."
"Rachel";"Oh, I'm sorry."
"Tag";"Yeah, so she went back to Ohio."
"Ross";"Ohio!! Thank you!"
"Chandler";"Huh! Where is the dog?!"
"Ross";"What dog? There-there's no dog here."
"Joey";"Yeah that dog left!"
"Monica";"(walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!"
"Phoebe";"There's no dog in here."
"Chandler";"Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!"
"Phoebe";"No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and thedog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, Ihave a dog in my room."
"Chandler";"What is it doing here?"
"Phoebe";"Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (Shebends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers.May I please stay with you nice people?"
"Monica";"Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!"
"Chandler";"Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5minutes, my throat will just close up!"
"Phoebe";"That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days"
"Chandler";"(gasping) Really?"
"Monica";"Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had areaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?"
"Chandler";"Well, it still has to go, right?"
"Monica and Phoebe";"Why?"
"Chandler";"Okay, it's um…"
"Joey";"(interrupting him) Don't do it!"
"Monica";"Don't do what?"
"Chandler";"(to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say,"Do what you have to do") Okay, I hate dogs."
"All";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Are you crazy?"
"Ross";"Are you out of your mind?"
"Phoebe";"Why?"
"Joey";"Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)"
"Chandler";"They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they arethinking, and that scares me a little bit."
"Ross";"Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treatout of my hand!!!"
"Rachel";"Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?"
"Chandler";"(scared) Is there a puppy here?"
"Tag";"You don't like puppies?"
"Chandler";"(to Tag) Okay, you are new!"
"Joey";"Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It'slike Ross not likin’ ice cream."
"Phoebe";"You don't like ice cream?"
"Ross";"It's"
"Chandler";"Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable."
"Ross";"(to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth."
"Chandler";"And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, Idon't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (Anawkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!"
"Ross";"How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s."
"Monica";"1250."
"Ross";"Damn, I forgot you were here."
"Phoebe";"All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in aminute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)"
"Rachel";"Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amountof time to wait before you make a move?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I'd say about a month."
"Monica";"Really? I'd say 3 to 4."
"Joey";"Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)"
"Rachel";"Interesting."
"Monica";"When it's your assistant, I would say never."
"Joey";"All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Becauseif he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point."
"Rachel";"Huh. A moo-point?"
"Joey";"Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo."
"Rachel";"(to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or didthat all just make sense?"
"Monica";"Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’sobviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.  What he needs right now is for you to be his friend."
"Rachel";"You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do."
"Joey";"Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package isthis pretty, no one cares what's inside."
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Tag";"Hey."
"Rachel";"How are you holding up?"
"Tag";"Not bad."
"Rachel";"Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend."
"Tag";"Thanks."
"Rachel";"So were you guys together a long time?"
"Tag";"A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore."
"Rachel";"Now that she broke up with you?"
"Tag";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Yeah. Hmmmm."
"Tag";"It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall inlove and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Doyou ever have that feeling?"
"Rachel";"No…Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you knowthat I figure it…it has to work out."
"Tag";"Why?"
"Rachel";"Because, uh—it has to."
"Tag";"You have all the answers, don't you?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I know, I do. I really do."
"Tag";"Hey, thanks for talking to me."
"Rachel";"Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug)"
"Joey";"(through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, youshould go for it!"
"Tag";"What?"
"Joey";"(realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachelmoves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed)"
"Tag";"What did Joey say? I like you back?"
"Rachel";"Uh, yeah, well, see, he… Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecureabout my back and, and…you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it,yeah!"
"Tag";"Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense."
"Rachel";"No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said whathe said, because um, I'm attracted to you."
"Tag";"Wow. (He starts to walk towards the railing.)"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that'scrazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing Iwant to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would bereally great if you said something right about now."
"Tag";"(looking at the street) Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car! (Hepoints down to the street)"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Tag";"Right there! That's my car! (Sound of a breaking car-window) Hey!!"
"Rachel";"Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else youwanna get off your chest?"
"Tag";"I can't believe this! (He walks back in again)"
"Rachel";"(she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk andthey’re-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Ohlook, there they go, okay. (She hurries in, too)"
"Monica";"Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now."
"Phoebe";"(doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely."
"Monica";"Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, okay."
"Monica";"Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back toClunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her!"
"Phoebe";"You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn'teven know."
"Monica";"That's not gonna work."
"Phoebe";"I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He'snot so smart."
"Monica";"Hey! I didn't know either."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?"
"Monica";"Yeah, I knew."
"Phoebe";"Where's Chandler?"
"Chandler";"(comes out of the bathroom) Here I am."
"Phoebe";"Wash your hands!!!"
"Chandler";"How did you…know? (Heads back into the bathroom)"
"Ross";"Hey! What's she doing back here?"
"Monica";"Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!"
"Ross";"Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically..."
"Phoebe";"(interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now.Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom."
"Ross";"Yeah, but, but look what I'm..."
"Phoebe";"See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into herroom)"
"Chandler";"(comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?"
"Ross";"Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there."
"Chandler";"Why not?"
"Ross";"Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing."
"Chandler";"Well, I, I should go in there."
"Ross";"No. No, no. She doesn't want to see"
"Chandler";"Why not?"
"Ross";"Because you sent away the dog!"
"Chandler";"This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)"
"Ross";"Oh, is it?"
"Joey";"(entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees thatChandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter?"
"Chandler";"Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away."
"Joey";"So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero."
"Chandler";"Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I,w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?"
"Joey";"Chandler, it's like a big gerbil."
"Chandler";"And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out)"
"Joey";"Ross, you need some help?"
"Ross";"From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying)Yes, please!"
"Joey";"(sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just makestuff up!"
"Ross";"I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving."
"Joey";"Hey! Tag's still talking to the police."
"Rachel";"Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) Ihave a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that Ifreaked him out"
"Joey";"If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah."
"Phoebe";"(opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here?"
"Chandler";"No, no he went for a walk."
"Phoebe";"Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!"
"Rachel";"(gasps) Hi!"
"Joey";"Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!"
"Phoebe";"Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!"
"Joey";"You think?"
"Monica";"Hi, honey."
"Chandler";"Please, please, please, don't be mad at me."
"Monica";"What? Why, why would..."
"Phoebe";"(interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe wewon't."
"Chandler";"Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers.Y’know, for you, and…(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must havegotten out and I looked"
"Phoebe";"We have good news, look whose back!"
"Rachel";"(uncovers the dog) Hi!"
"Chandler";"Clunkers?! Oh my god!"
"Monica";"That's right, she came back all by herself."
"Phoebe";"It's a Thanksgiving miracle!"
"Chandler";"(to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things shemust have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window withher teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in…(Realizes, that Chandler starts tonot believing her) I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?"
"Ross";"Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tellyou something, I have 49 states, and there are"
"Chandler";"It's up to you."
"Rachel";"Oh, hi! How are you doing?"
"Tag";"I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots."
"Rachel";"Oh."
"Tag";"Thanks for having me over, you guys."
"Ross";"Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't getthe chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?"
"Tag";"Colorado."
"Ross";"Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.)"
"Rachel";"Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace."
"Tag";"Okay."
"Rachel";"Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? Itjust doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really everhappen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and nevertalk about this again, okay?"
"Tag";"Um, I'm not."
"Rachel";"Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out."
"Tag";"No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying thatnothing could ever happen between us."
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Tag";"Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. (He kisses her)"
"Rachel";"Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday."
"Ross";"Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!"
"Chandler";"All right."
"Ross";"(hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now!"
"Chandler";"You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross got the turkey outof the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) You got Nevada twice."
"Ross";"(pauses) I know."
"Chandler";"Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)"
"Ben";"(on the bike) I’m ready!"
"Ross";"You sure?"
"Ben";"Uh-huh!"
"Chandler";"Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)"
"Ben";"(To Chandler) Thanks daddy."
"Ross";"No-no, one daddy, two"
"Chandler";"Okay. Okay."
"Ross";"Yes! Yes! Yes!! (Everyone stands and claps.)"
"Phoebe";"His first big kid’s bike, this is so exciting!"
"Monica";"Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took meto the park, I got it, and…it bent."
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"I never had a bike of my own."
"Ross";"(shocked) What?!"
"Phoebe";"Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the streethad the"
"Chandler";"That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) Mydad gave me his old one."
"Ross";"Ohh."
"Monica";"Did the girl ever let you ride it?"
"Phoebe";"No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of thebike on the front. (They’re all speechless) So I would sit on it and my step-dadwould drag me around the backyard."
"Ross";"That is so unfair!"
"Phoebe";"Not really, I got to drag him around too! (They all nod,"Oh.")"
"Chandler";"Hey! What are you guys doing?"
"Joey";"Hey."
"Monica";"Making holiday candy for the neighbors."
"Chandler";"I’m sorry, who?"
"Monica";"I’m gonna hang this basket (Points to the one sitting on the table)on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece."
"Chandler";"But we don’t know the neighbors."
"Joey";"I do. There’s uh, let’s see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-LotLady, Some Kids I’ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty."
"Monica";"See? This is"
"Chandler";"Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?"
"Rachel";"(entering, happily) Gooood morning!!"
"Chandler";"Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!"
"Rachel";"Well, why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderfuljob!"
"Monica";"Where you can make out with your assistant."
"Rachel";"Come on, it’s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up witha plan so that us dating will not be a problem."
"Monica";"Oh yeah, what’s the plan?"
"Rachel";"(pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) We… We are not……going to let it… be a problem."
"Monica";"Wow! It took you all night to come up with"
"Rachel";"Well y’know, we did other stuff too. (Joey and Chandler start togiggle.)"
"Monica";"Did you two…"
"Rachel";"Oh Monica come on, y’know I don’t sleep with guys on the firstdate!"
"Monica";"Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire…"
"Rachel";"Anymore!!"
"Monica";"Okay."
"Rachel";"Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?"
"Tag";"Yes, at 4:00."
"Rachel";"Okay, thank you. That’ll be all. (The mail guy leaves and Tagstarts to follow, but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closesthe office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going onbetween us. (They kiss.)"
"Tag";"I’d better get back to my desk."
"Rachel";"Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in yourevaluation."
"Tag";"My what?"
"Rachel";"Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is requiredto hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know, there is one thing that I have yetto evaluate. (She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.)"
"Tag";"Are you serious?"
"Rachel";"No, I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean thisup?"
"Monica";"The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!"
"Chandler";"Well, either that or uh…(Motions towards Joey’s door.)"
"Monica";"Joey!!"
"Joey";"Yeah?"
"Monica";"Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!"
"Joey";"Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there wasonly a couple of pieces left!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it!"
"Monica";"They love my candy? Oh man!!! I’ve gotta go make more!! (Starts todo so.)"
"Joey";"Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because somethingmight’ve happened to a huge chunk of it."
"Monica";"Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!"
"Ross";"Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a"
"Phoebe";"Sure!"
"Ross";"Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-Icouldn’t stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a"
"Phoebe";"(gasps) Oh my God Ross!!"
"Ross";"You like it?"
"Phoebe";"I"
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Phoebe";"Ohh!! Ohh!! And I"
"Ross";"Ahh."
"Phoebe";"Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!"
"Ross";"Ah! (She hugs him.) Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y’know give ita test ride."
"Phoebe";"Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I’veever gotten."
"Ross";"(stunned at the complement) You’re welcome."
"Phoebe";"(starts to leave, but stops) Oh and Chandler’s about to cry."
"Chandler";"(about to cry) Am not!"
"Monica";"(turning a light on) Who is that?!"
"Chandler";"Don’t worry, I’m brave! I am brave! I…I am brave! (Theyget to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through thedoor.) Can you tell me who is there please?"
"The Knocker";"My name is Gary, I live upstairs."
"Gary";"Hi!"
"Monica";"Hi. Do you know what time it is?"
"Gary";"It’s candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little dropsof heaven."
"Monica";"Oh please! (To Chandler) Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven."
"Chandler";"(laughs) 4:00 A.M."
"Gary";"So, can I get some candy?"
"Chandler";"I am sorry, but some of us have to"
"Monica";"Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in themorning."
"Gary";"Well okay, I’ll swing by later. Do you live in this building?"
"Monica";"Um-hmm."
"Gary";"(looking at Monica.) Mm! Seems like I would’ve remembered you!"
"Chandler";"Mm! Night Gar’! (Monica closes the door.)"
"Rachel";"(hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?"
"Tag";"No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources."
"Rachel";"(worried) Okay please, you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as ajoke for you!"
"Tag";"A joke they would appreciate?"
"Rachel";"I’m thinkin’ no."
"Tag";"What did you say?!"
"Rachel";"Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I likeyour tiney-tiny touchie."
"Tag";"No, not my touchie."
"Rachel";"Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote,"Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problemswith Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew alittle smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch."
"Monica";"Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard thestory, I almost cried."
"Joey";"Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!"
"Chandler";"Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about"
"Joey";"(about to cry) Those two only had each other!"
"Ross";"Phoebe really likes the bike huh?"
"Monica";"Oh yeah! I saw her walkin’ it down the street the other day. Shehad uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute."
"Joey";"Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin’ it by the park."
"Ross";"Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?"
"Joey";"Hey Pheebs?"
"Phoebe";"Oh hi!"
"Chandler";"Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?"
"Phoebe";"Ohh, uh-huh so much!"
"Ross";"Pheebs you uh…you do know how to ride a bike don’t you?"
"Phoebe";"Of course!"
"Monica";"Umm, can we see you ride it?"
"Phoebe";"Okay. (The gang is giggles then Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack,gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) See?"
"Monica";"See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! Andhere is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (To Chandler) Did youhear that Chandler? No such thing!"
"Chandler";"(with his mouth full) What happened? I’m just eating candy."
"Rachel";"Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe theydidn’t take it the way I meant it."
"Chandler";"Absolutely! Y’know, because touchie can mean both ass and goodworker."
"Rachel";"Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!"
"Joey";"Hey Rach?"
"Rachel";"Yeah?"
"Joey";"That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something likethis? (He shows her what he’s been drawing.)"
"Rachel";"Oh my God! Joey!"
"Chandler";"What is the matter with you?"
"Rachel";"Ugh!"
"Joey";"Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could affordporn."
"The Woman";"Hi! I’m sorry, I know it’s after hours but I really needcandy."
"Monica";"I’m sorry, I can’t help you. See? (Points to her new sign.)Rules are rules."
"The Woman";"Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told themall about your candy!"
"Monica";"No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell ‘em?"
"The Woman";"I told ‘em your candy is absolutely indescribable!"
"Monica";"Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, butwhatever."
"The Woman";"Please, can’t you help me out?"
"Joey";"(watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?"
"Chandler";"Maybe, isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex reallyloud?"
"Monica";"(still talking to the woman) All right, I’ll do it just this once!But you can’t tell anybody!"
"The Woman";"(exasperatedly) Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!"
"Joey and Chandler";"Yeah, that’s her."
"The Woman";"(after Monica gives her the candy) Thank you."
"Monica";"(closing the door) It’s unbelievable! I-I can’t believe thatsign didn’t work!"
"Chandler";"Y’know what would work?"
"Monica";"Hmm?"
"Chandler";"Stop making candy!"
"Monica";"But they like it!"
"Chandler";"You mean they like you."
"Monica";"Maybe."
"Chandler";"Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?"
"Monica";"Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funnyman? (Joey laughs but stops when Chandler turns to glare at him.)"
"Ross";"Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine.Okay? Here we go. Ready…Set…"
"Phoebe";"(hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah,maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplaneseat—or a beanbag chair!"
"Ross";"Phoebe, you can’t get out of this! Okay? You"
"Phoebe";"Why? Why do I"
"Ross";"Well…In-in case of emergency."
"Phoebe";"What kind of an emergency?"
"Ross";"Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your headand says, "You ride this bike or I’ll sh…I’ll shoot you.""
"Phoebe";"Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock thegun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star."
"Ross";"Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—Hey! I’ll holdyou up and-and push you. Okay?"
"Phoebe";"You won’t let go?"
"Ross";"No!"
"Phoebe";"Swear?!"
"Ross";"I swear!"
"Phoebe";"(thinks it over) Okay."
"Ross";"Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right, here we go. All right? (Theystart.)"
"Phoebe";"All right."
"Ross";"All right. Feel good?"
"Phoebe";"Well…"
"Ross";"All right, try pedaling."
"Phoebe";"Okay. (Does so.)"
"Ross";"That’s it, your doing great."
"Phoebe";"Okay."
"Ross";"Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!"
"Phoebe";"Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.)"
"Ross";"Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at himand falls off the bike.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!"
"Ross";"I-I just thought you were doing so well. I…"
"Phoebe";"I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himselffrom the angry looks from onlookers.)"
"Ross";"It’s a legitimate learning technique. (Looking around and seeing thewoman behind him glaring at him.) Wow!"
"Ross";"Hey, there’s uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy."
"Monica";"Well, they’re just gonna have to wait aren’t they? I’veonly got two hands!!"
"Ross";"Need some help?"
"Monica";"No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing withthe system!"
"Ross";"By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (Sheglares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebe’s room.)"
"Phoebe";"(seeing him) Oh, hello liar."
"Ross";"(entering) Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike."
"Phoebe";"I could’ve been killed I hope you know!"
"Ross";"I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were"
"Phoebe";"Well, I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police haveno suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering somethingthat suspiciously looks like a bike.)"
"Ross";"Phoebe."
"Phoebe";"What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!"
"Ross";"All right, y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ridethis bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back."
"Phoebe";"What?! Why?!"
"Ross";"Because! Because, it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having thisguitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar"
"Phoebe";"All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay."
"Ross";"Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) You’re making the bike veryhappy."
"Phoebe";"(sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike)Please don’t die!"
"Rachel";"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, butwe’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now, he doesn’t get inuntil 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat herbreakfast at her desk."
"Tag";"That’s kinda sad."
"Rachel";"Yeah, well Betty’s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure heraway with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her,"
"Tag";"Got it!"
"Rachel";"Let’s roll!"
"Mr. Zelner";"Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?"
"Rachel";"(worried and shocked) Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for youanything—minute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start tousher Tag out.)"
"Mr. Zelner";"Uh actually, I’d like to speak with both of you."
"Rachel";"Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe somechocolates? (Holds up the box.)"
"Mr. Zelner";"Umm, no. Thanks, but I’ll give these to Betty. (Rachel glancesat Tag to say, "See?") So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his fullname, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?"
"Rachel";"(laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (gettingserious) what would happen exactly."
"Mr. Zelner";"Well, I’d be forced to file a report. I’d have to consultwith the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy."
"Rachel";"Well…"
"Tag";"(interrupting) Uh Mr. Zelner, I’m the one who filled in thatevaluation."
"Rachel";"Oh no-no-no…"
"Tag";"(interrupting again) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny."
"Mr. Zelner";"You wrote that you have a cute touchie?"
"Tag";"(pause) Yes. I have a"
"Mr. Zelner";"It’s kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawingI can’t figure out what this is?"
"Rachel";"You’re lookin’ at it upside down—y’know what? (Grabsthe evaluation and throws it out.) It doesn’t matter."
"Mr. Zelner";"Yeah, it’s not like I don’t have a sense of humor, huh?Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there’s a time and a place,huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? (They both nod no.) No? Okay, well uh,you’ve (Grabs the chocolates.) got my fax number. (Exits.)"
"Rachel";"Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet."
"Tag";"No, don’t worry about it."
"Rachel";"No, you could’ve lost your job."
"Tag";"Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I’d find work."
"Rachel";"Thank you! You’re great! (They kiss.)"
"Tag";"Y’know what?"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Tag";"I feel great. (Rachel laughs) In fact! (Walks over to her desk, sweeps itscontents onto the floor and Rachel just glares at him.) What?"
"Rachel";"I… It just—it took me so long to get that desk organized."
"Tag";"Oh, I’m sorry. (He bends over to pick the stuff up.)"
"Rachel";"(looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)"
"Chandler";"(asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on?"
"The Man";"We’re waiting for the candy. (Yelling at the door.) Bring out thecandy!"
"Joey";"Yeah lady! Give us candy!!"
"Chandler";"Joey!"
"Joey";"What’s up buddy?"
"Chandler";"What are you doing?"
"Joey";"Waiting for candy."
"Chandler";"Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-LotLady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here!(Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas."
"Monica";"(opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; Ijust need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!"
"Chandler";"All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!!Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This womanwas trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get toknow all of you, and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?"
"The Man";"(from earlier) Candy Lady?"
"Chandler";"No not (imitating) Candy Lady."
"Joey";"(stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we havecandy?!!"
"Chandler";"All right, y’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it!You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!"
"Joey";"That’s right, it’s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! Youruined it! (Steps into the apartment and Chandler closes the door.) (Joey struts over tothe candy and starts eating it.)"

"Monica";"Did you smoke?"
"Chandler";"No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.Eh-uh—are you okay?"
"Monica";"I’m fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean,someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door."
"Joey";"(with his mouth full) Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality orwhatever, I don’t know… (Grabs the note.)"
"Phoebe";"I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thoughtI’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross."
"Ross";"Oh hey, don’t thank me, thank yourself. You’re the one who facedher fears and ultimately overcame them."
"Phoebe";"Don’t be so corny Ross, it’s not an after-school special. (Sherides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmlyattached.)"
"Chandler";"Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations atMichelle’s and tickets to the"

"Phoebe";"And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how peopledie."
"Rachel";"You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe."
"Ross";"Hmm."
"Joey";"Hey. (He exits)"
"Rachel";"(to Monica) Did you know he was in there?"
"Monica";"No."
"Chandler";"How long have we been home?"
"Monica";"About a half an hour."

"Monica";"You've got to be smooth about it."
"Chandler";"Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly)Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'dappreciate it. (Shakes his hand)"
"Maitre d'";"Of course, sir."
"Chandler";"Okay. (Walks back to Monica)"
"Monica";"How did it go?"

"Ben";"No Santa? Was I bad?"
"Ross";"No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben."

"Monica";"It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand andgive him the money!"
"Chandler";"How do you know so much about this?"
"Monica";"I don't know."
"Chandler";"Richard used to do it, didn't he?"
"Monica";"We'd be eating our soup right now."
"Chandler";"Mustached bastard…"
"Monica";"(sees two people exit) Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick!Give him the money and get their table!"
"Chandler";"(walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me..."
"Chandler";"(finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' hismoney, but he isn't there anymore)"
"Rachel";"(stopping at Phoebe’s entrance) Ha!"
"Phoebe";"So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried,that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well,apparently not! So, yay!"
"Joey";"Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. (To Rachel)Ready? One, two, three, four..."
"Rachel and Joey";"Tequila!!"
"Phoebe";"That's fun. (She exits disappointedly.)"
"Chandler";"Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther'shand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely noteasier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is justhelping him to pick them up.) Thank you."
"Joey";"Thank you. (He gets up and puts on his jacket.) (Phoebe enters) HeyPheebs!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Here. (Gives her the coins) Now I only owe you $49.50."
"Chandler";"Hey Pheebs!"
"Phoebe";"Hey! (she sits down next to him)"
"Chandler";"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entirebuilding, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or avile of small pox to release in the hallway?"
"Monica";"It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticksin the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is soannoying."
"Phoebe";"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to reactto drums."
"Monica";"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna livethere anymore?"
"Phoebe";"Maybe on some level."
"Rachel";"Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in theair."
"Joey";"What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?"
"Phoebe";"(entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey, Joey, I got youanother present. (She puts it on the counter)"
"Joey";"Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! (He plays a drum-roll) Okay, whatis it?"
"Phoebe";"It's a…tarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stooljumping up) Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big,gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?"
"Rachel";"What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah, Ihad a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then mycat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?"
"Joey";"Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! (He storms intohis room)"
"Rachel";"Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula."
"Phoebe";"(sarcastic) Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joeyis the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. (She turns around, about to leave)"
"Rachel";"What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?"
"Phoebe";"Our apartment is ready."
"Rachel";"And that makes you angry because…"
"Phoebe";"Because you would rather live here with Joey."
"Rachel";"Where did you get that?"
"Phoebe";"Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. Andapparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that."
"Rachel";"Phoebe?"
"Phoebe";"Hm?"
"Rachel";"Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of theapartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, youknow how fish freaked me out!"
"Phoebe";"(nods along) Fish!"
"Rachel";"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna livetogether, we're roommates; that's the deal."
"Phoebe";"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you'rehaving so much fun over here…"
"Rachel";"Oh, it's so much more fun with you."
"Phoebe";"We did have fun, didn't we?"
"Rachel";"We did!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight."
"Rachel";"Oh, I would love to!"
"Phoebe";"Yay, okay!"
"Rachel";"Good, good, good, good, good. (She runs to the drums and gets thesticks)"
"Phoebe";"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop."
"Rachel";"(with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage andputs the sticks into it) Done!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Salesman";"Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?"
"Ross";"No, these are my pants."
"Salesman";"Oh. Okay! How can I help you?"
"Ross";"Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?"
"Salesman";"Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man."
"Ross";"Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and Ireally don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something."
"Ross";"I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here towish you (Points to Ben) a Merry Christmas!"
"Monica";"What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?"
"Ross";"(to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas."
"Monica";"Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the wayfrom…Texas."
"Ben";"Texas?"
"Ross";"That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states.And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. (He tries to benddown to pick up the bag with the presents, but can't because of the costume) Maybe theLady will help me with these presents."
"Ben";"Wow! Thanks!"
"Ross";"You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!"
"Ben";"Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish."
"Ross";"(gasps) You are? Me, too!"
"Monica";"Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?"
"Ross";"(to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh, hey Ben, what ifthe Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?"
"Ben";"Cool!"
"Ross";"Yeah!"
"Monica";"Come on Ben."
"Ross";"Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees..."
"Chandler";"(entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!"
"Ben";"Santa! (Runs to Chandler and hugs him)"
"Chandler";"Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)"
"Ross";"What are you doing here, Santa?"
"Chandler";"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here,weird…turtle-man?"
"Ross";"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here togive Ben some presents. Remember?"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Ben";"Did you bring me any presents, Santa?"
"Chandler";"You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the moneyfalls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his handsweren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!"
"Monica";"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, theArmadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thoughtI'd say."
"Ross";"(to Chandler) What are you doing?"
"Chandler";"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santacostume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
"Ross";"Thank you, but, but you gotta leave."
"Chandler";"Why?"
"Ross";"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, andyou're-you’re wrecking it."
"Chandler";"But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly."
"Ross";"I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me."
"Chandler";"Fine, I'll give the suit back."
"Monica";"(to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has areally teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)"
"Chandler";"Santa? Really?"
"Monica";"Yes, is that okay?"
"Chandler";"Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?"
"Monica";"No."
"Chandler";"Then it's okay! (They kiss.)"
"Ross";"Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!"
"Ben";"No! Why does he have to go?"
"Chandler";"Because, if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo? (Ross nods) ...areever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!"
"Ben";"No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!"
"Ross";"Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay."
"Chandler";"Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben,will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?"
"Ben";"Okay, Santa!"
"Ross";"All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, therewere these people called the Maccabees."
"Joey";"(entering wearing a"
"Rachel";"Oh wow! Look at this place!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’teven feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!"
"Rachel";"(yelling from another room) Oh my God!"
"Phoebe";"What?"
"Rachel";"(returning) Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that yourgrandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would findout and then tear it down?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"Do you really not know where I’m going with this? (Phoebe nods,"No.") It left! It’s one huge room!"
"Phoebe";"Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back, excitedly) Oh! Wow!!!"
"Rachel";"See?"
"Phoebe";"Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up."
"Rachel";"You can’t, because of the new skylight!"
"Phoebe";"There’s a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.)Wow!!"
"Rachel";"So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?"
"Phoebe";"(returning slowly) Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um, mygrandmother would not be comfortable with that."
"Rachel";"Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?"
"Phoebe";"A little bit, yeah."
"Rachel";"Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?"
"Phoebe";"You heard her too?! You have the gift!"
"Rachel";"Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey."
"Phoebe";"Are you sure?"
"Rachel";"Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun.Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you."
"Phoebe";"Oh me too."
"Rachel";"I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen,I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keepthe one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?"
"Phoebe";"No, I do not hear that."
"Ross";"…and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’vejust lasted just one day, burned for…"
"Ben";"(answering him) Eight whole days."
"Ross";"That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. Theend."
"Ben";"Awesome!"
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Chandler";"My favorite part was when"
"Ross";"The Armadillo was actually not so"
"Rachel";"(entering with Phoebe) Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Oh."
"Rachel";"(seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the EasterBunny’s funeral in here."
"Ross";"Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!"
"Rachel";"Oh."
"Phoebe";"Oh."
"Phoebe";"Okay, I understand why"
"Rachel";"I got it!"
"Joey";"(yelling from the bedroom) Is it back in the cage?"
"Rachel";"Its back in cage!"
"Joey";"Cage closed?"
"Rachel";"Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!"
"Chandler";"Ohh. Mmm."
"Rachel";"(Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi."
"Chandler";"Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake."
"Rachel";"Oh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I—(Chandlerputs a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)—Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God,this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over tolook at the label on the box.)"
"Chandler";"(nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sentit to us."
"Rachel";"Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs.Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief."
"Chandler";"I—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can'treturn a box after you've opened the box."
"Rachel";"Why, why not?"
"Chandler";"Because it's too delicious."
"Rachel";"Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong."
"Chandler";"No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna sendaway for a free one and that way we"
"Rachel";"(taking a bite) Oh, I’m sorry what?"
"Joey";"All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y’know I’m in acoma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead."
"Chandler";"So…"
"Joey";"Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it’s just not my character that’snot brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?"
"Phoebe";"Absolutely!"
"Joey";"I’ll see you at 8:00."
"Phoebe";"Okay. (Joey exits.)"
"Chandler";"Oh, what’s at 8:00?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month todiscuss the rest of you guys."
"Ross";"Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?"
"Phoebe";"Duly noted."
"Ross";"Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow,do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?"
"Monica";"What are you talking about?"
"Ross";"Cousin Frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night."
"Ross";"No."
"Monica";"My God, I can’t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad wereinvited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I wereinseparable!"
"Chandler";"Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends."
"Ross";"Well l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call AuntSheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail."
"Monica";"Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kidsher precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn’thave stopped her, there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go too."
"Ross";"Y’know, she tried to undress me too."
"Chandler";"I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then susheshim.)"
"Phoebe";"Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!"
"Rachel";"Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?"
"Phoebe";"Well, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joeytonight and he left me this note. (Hands it to Rachel.)"
"Rachel";"(reading the note) "Pheebs, can’t make it, got a date. Talk toyou later. Big Daddy." (Laughs) Big Daddy?"
"Phoebe";"Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out."
"Ross";"Hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monicashakes her head in disgust.)"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!"
"Joey";"Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!"
"Phoebe";"So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!"
"Joey";"Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility forsex!"
"Ross";"Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule."
"Phoebe";"I don’t accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to showup. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (Motions that theirfriendship) is for life!"
"Joey";"Wow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much."
"Phoebe";"Well, it does."
"Joey";"Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry. (They hug.) Howabout uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, you wore me down."
"Ross";"Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for theRoss-A-Tron?"
"Joey";"The Ross—Is that back?!! (Chandler motions no.)"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Chandler";"Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!"
"Rachel";"So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?"
"Chandler";"I can’t seem to say goodbye."
"Rachel";"Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago andyou want more?"
"Chandler";"Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!"
"Rachel";"It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, grahamcracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling… (Pause) Wow! Mywhole mouth just filled with saliva!"
"Chandler";"(closing the box) Y’know what? Forget it!"
"Rachel";"Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re nottempted."
"Chandler";"Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?"
"Rachel";"Momma’s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. (They exit with thecheesecake.)"
"Joey";"Awww! Mel Torme died."
"Monica";"Joey, that paper’s like a year old!"
"Joey";"Aw! Does that mean the"
"Ross";"(entering) Hey."
"Joey";"Hey."
"Monica";"Hey."
"Ross";"So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it"
"Monica";"Limited seating?! (Screechingly)"
"Ross";"Well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she sawyou-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling."
"Monica";"(disgusted) Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That’snot the reason she’s not inviting me!"
"Ross";"Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony,just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and Iwill just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as asign of protest."
"Monica";"Joan?"
"Ross";"Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in theLinguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say,"
"Monica";"Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited andyou got "and guest?!""
"Joey";"Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I thinkthe rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…"
"Ross";"(interrupting)"
"Monica";"Wait a minute, y’know, you’re bringing me!"
"Ross";"What? I can’t cancel on Joan!"
"Monica";"Why not?!"
"Ross";"Bec—Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in theLinguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?"
"Monica";"Because! She’s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We’refamily y’know? Well that’s important to me."
"Ross";"Okay, all right, I’ll take you. I’ll go call Joan. (Does so.)"
"Joey";"Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding,happiest day of her life."
"Monica";"(laughs) We’ll see."
"Chandler";"Well, thank you for lunch."
"Rachel";"What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!"
"Chandler";"So apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughsthen Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?"
"Rachel";"(gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Bravermanis still lying in front of her door.)"
"Chandler";"Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)"
"Rachel";"She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months."
"Chandler";"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her tocome back to bad cheesecake."
"Rachel";"No that could kill her."
"Chandler";"Well, we don’t want that."
"Rachel";"No so we’re protecting her."
"Chandler";"But we should take it."
"Rachel";"But we should move quick."
"Chandler";"Why?"
"Rachel";"Because I think I just heard her moving around in there."
"Chandler";"Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecakeand they take off upstairs.)"

"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"David";"Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make…"

"David";"Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn’t know whether Ishould call or not, y’know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y’know, Ididn’t want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wantedto see you and—but I didn’t know if you wanted to see me."
"Phoebe";"Well, of course I would want to see you. I…I think about you allthe time."
"David";"Really? Because"
"Phoebe";"Really?"
"David";"I mean, there’s a statue in Minsk…"
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh."
"David";"That reminds me of you"
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"David";"Umm, anyway…Do you want to have dinner tonight?"
"Phoebe";"(excited) Yes! Oh no!"

"Monica";"So! He’ll understand!"
"Phoebe";"No he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica, I made awhole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Justbecause, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-Ishould change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don’t have myprinciples, I don’t have anything!"
"Monica";"God, you are so strong."
"Phoebe";"Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!"
"Rachel";"(taking a bite) Oh my God! That is so good!"
"Chandler";"I’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I’ll regretit."
"Joey";"(entering) Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey!"

"Chandler";"Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!"
"Rachel";"(with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)"
"Chandler";"I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries towhistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat thecheesecake without me?!"
"Rachel";"Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Areyou gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We aredesert stealers! We are living outside the law!"

"Chandler";"What do we"
"Rachel";"Okay! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half."
"Chandler";"(examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh…There’s more crust on this side. Y’know? So, maybe if I measured…"
"Rachel";"Oh for God sake just pick a piece!"
"Chandler";"All right, I’ll pick that one. (Points.)"
"Rachel";"That’s also the smaller piece. (Puts the piece onto a plate.) Okay,there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, anddon’t come crying to me if"

Just sit here in thehallway and eat my… (Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor.That process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that littlebit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.)"
"The Woman";"Ross, sweetheart!"
"Ross";"Oh, hey Aunt Millie."
"Ross";"Yes, yes it is. It’s uh… (Aunt Millie uses this opportunity tograb Ross and kiss him on the lips. After she leaves Ross quickly wipes his mouth with anapkin.) Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!"
"Monica";"Here’s Frannie. Hmm, won’t she be happy to see me? (Starts toget up and great Frannie.)"
"Ross";"Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here soyou can ambush her."

"Monica";"Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do youlike that?!"
"Ross";"(to Frannie) Hi Frannie, congratulations."
"Monica";"You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?!What—Why wouldn’t you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?!(Frannie’s husband walks up.) Stuart!"
"Frannie";"I believe you know my husband."
"Ross";"So it’s really a question of"
"David";"Oh, I"
"Phoebe";"Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk inlike…"
"David";"July. Umm, (He speaks Russian.)"
"Phoebe";"That’s really beautiful. What does it mean?"
"David";"Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much."
"Phoebe";"That’s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else."
"David";"Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, Ifigured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave."
"Phoebe";"You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it."
"David";"I-I do though."
"Phoebe";"I do too. (They kiss.)"
"David";"Bye Phoebe. (He gets in and the cab drives off. Joey walks up andwitnesses that event.)"
"Phoebe";"(seeing him) Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yellat me tomorrow."
"Joey";"No! No! No Pheebs, I’m not gonna yell at you. I just y’know,started thinking about you and David and I…remember how bummed you were the firsttime he left. And I just… Oh Pheebs, come here. (He hugs her.) Are you okay?"
"Phoebe";"No I’m not okay. The only guy I’ve ever been crazy about hasgone to Minsk and I may never…I may never see him again. (Crying.)"
"Joey";"Hey, y’know you could always visit him."
"Phoebe";"Oh right, like they’re gonna let me have a passport."
"Joey";"Anything I can do? Whatever you need."
"Phoebe";"Well—But—Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation ofsub-atomic particles y’know before he does, then he can come back. (They hug again.)"
"Joey";"I can give it a shot."
"Rachel";"Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!"
"Chandler";"Stick to your side!"
"Rachel";"Hey, come on now!"
"Joey";"(pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin’? (Starts diggingin.)"
"Monica";"Oh wait I forgot my wrap."
"Ross";"What? Oh, okay. Wait here. (Goes to get it, but before he gets there AuntMillie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets herattention.)"
"Ross";"Well…"
"Ross";"Why?! Why on the lips?! (He wipes his mouth on Monica’s wrap andwalks off, leaving Aunt Millie stunned.)"
"Monica";"(looking up) Ross, when’s this comet thing start?"
"Ross";"Well, technically it seven"
"All";"(groaning) Oh no! Oh no! (They all start to get up a leave.)"
"Ross";"Okay! Okay! Fine, I’ll stop! No teaching, okay? We’ll just watchthe pretty light streaking across the sky. (Comets don’t streak across the sky,meteors do.) Okay? Who’s official name is Bapstein-King."
"All";"Okay! Okay! (They start to leave again.)"
"Phoebe";"(looking up) There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn’t Mother Natureamazing?"
"Chandler";"(looking up with her) That’s a plane!"
"Phoebe";"Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that’spretty amazing too."
"Tag";"Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here."
"Rachel";"No. No, you can’t."
"Tag";"What?"
"Rachel";"Oh I don’t-I don’t know."
"Ross";"Man, look at all those stars! (Yeah, you can see what? Five of them fromthe city?) Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn’t it?"
"Joey";"(looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) Y’know whatelse makes you wonder?"
"Ross";"Huh?"
"Joey";"Check out the rack on this chick! (Turns around to point it out to Rossand finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes andstarts looking for the comet.)"
"Monica";"Okay, we’ve been out here for two hours and we haven’t seenany stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler’s getting chilly. (She walks overto where Chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shivering.)"
"Chandler";"(with a quivering voice) No, I’m not!"
"Joey";"Then why are you wearing Monica’s jacket?"
"Chandler";"Because it’s flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come onMonica! (He goes inside.)"
"Rachel";"Yeah actually, I think we’re gonna take off too. We rented a movie."
"Phoebe";"Oh! I won’t say, ‘no’ to a movie!"
"Rachel";"Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone."
"Phoebe";"Shh! Get me out of here."
"Rachel";"Oh. (They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)"
"Joey";"(whispering) Ross!"
"Ross";"What?"
"Joey";"Come here, check this out!"
"Ross";"What? Is it the comet? (Runs over to where Joey’s standing.)"
"Joey";"No! No-no. Look, there’s a bug stuck in tar right here. (Bends downto get a closer look.)"
"Ross";"Joey come—I can’t believe—I bring you here to see theBapstein-King comet, one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you careabout are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!"
"Joey";"(standing up) Y’know, there’s"
"Ross";"Show me where?"
"Joey";"Right-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)"
"Ross";"(noticing the pipe and looking at the door) Joey where’s the pipethat was holding the door open?"
"Joey";"(annoyed) I don’t know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.)(Pause) Yeah, I do."
"Ross";"Joey!"
"Joey";"What?! All right—Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one whowanted to come up and look for some stupid"
"Ross";"It’s called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? (Joey starts to groan.)Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!"
"Joey";"(covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on thedoor.)"
"Chandler";"(whispering) Monica!"
"Monica";"She’s sleeping."
"Chandler";"I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was"
"Chandler";"Sorry, I just…can’t sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light andMonica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who wereice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time Ilook at that cover I’m like…(Fake snores.)"
"Monica";"It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one willkick you in the shin."
"Chandler";"What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed andheads into the living room.)"
"Phoebe";"(crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) Please don’t be a spaceship. Please don’t be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around andfinds that it’s the smoke detector that’s beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves achair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in frustration sheyanks the thing off of the wall. She sets it down and heads for bed, just as she getsthere it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.)How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can…"
"Smoke Detector";"Beep!"
"Phoebe";"Don’t interrupt me!!"
"Ross";"Rachel!! Monica!!"
"Joey";"Come on!"
"Ross";"I can’t believe this!!"
"Joey";"All right well, y’know…I guess we know what we have to do to getdown."
"Ross";"(standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah, I guess we don’t have achoice. (Screaming to the street) Help us! Please help us! We’re stuck up on the roofand we can’t get down!!!"
"Joey";"Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (Points itout.)"
"Ross";"(To Joey) I know, I wasn’t finished. (Joey motions him to finish.)(Yelling at the street) But don’t worry! We’re gonna go down the fire escape!!"
"Chandler";"Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) I’m sorry, I thought maybe I’dmake some warm milk and it would help me sleep."
"Monica";"With a wok? (Chandler’s holding a wok.) I thought you were going toread my boring book to put you asleep."
"Chandler";"It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!"
"Monica";"Here, let me make the milk, I’m up anyway."
"Chandler";"Hey, y’know what we can do? Y’know, now that we are up? Wecan just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we werefirst going out. It’d be fun!"
"Monica";"Okay that does sound like fun."
"Chandler";"Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?"
"Monica";"The second sister dies?!"
"Chandler";"(Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading."
"Monica";"The second sister dies in"
"Chandler";"That’s correct."
"Rachel";"You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable."
"Tag";"Sure."
"Rachel";"Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm, did you sendthose contracts to Milan?"
"Tag";"If this is your idea of sexy talk? (Shakes his head that it’s notworking.)"
"Rachel";"No seriously, y’know the contracts I gave you, did you overnightthem?"
"Tag";"What contracts?"
"Rachel";"Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do thatI don’t get."
"Tag";"Like what?"

"Tag";"Rach, I’m sorry, but you didn’t give me any contracts!"
"Rachel";"Yes I did! And I put a little"
"Tag";"I’m telling you, you never gave them to me."
"Rachel";"Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see thosecontracts sitting on your desk."
"Tag";"No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are"
"Rachel";"Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking onthe phone with your crotch!"
"Tag";"You wanna go down to the office right now?"
"Rachel";"No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office."
"Tag";"Okay I understand. (Sits down.) I wouldn’t want to be proved wrongeither."
"Rachel";"Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachelsuddenly stops and sticks the hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhookthis? (Her bra.) Nice work!"
"Joey";"All right, it won’t go down any further. It’s stuck."
"Ross";"Ugh. Well, we’re just gonna have to jump. (Joey looks at him.) Yeah.Now, we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay?Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownishred stuff in the middle. So, when"
"Joey";"Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!"
"Ross";"Yeah! Oh yeah, you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh, just like bungyjumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t."
"Joey";"What if I smack my head on the concrete?"
"Ross";"Well, I’m gonna lie to you Joey, it’s a possibility."
"Joey";"(looks at the ground and at Ross) I don’t know Ross! I-I tell youwhat, let’s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?"
"Ross";"Oh, all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of thelanding above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?"
"Joey";"No."
"Ross";"Okay. Well, you be careful."
"Joey";"What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I’m not jumping! Okay, look I have anaudition tomorrow and I can’t go if I break my leg."
"Ross";"Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a fatherif-if I die!"
"Joey";"Well all right so, it looks like we’re even!"
"Phoebe";"Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here.(She points at each as she says it.) Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have todo… (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets upand heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping hasstopped.) Well done, Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entranceto the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smokedetector.) (Yelling.)"
"Monica";"Okay, here’s your milk. What do you want to talk about? (She seesthat Chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)"
"Chandler";"(startled) What? What? What?"
"Monica";"Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I’m sorry. Here. (Hands themug of milk to him.)"
"Tag";"Okay! Feel free to look, but I’m telling you those contracts are noton this desk."
"Rachel";"Oh"
"Tag";"It’s my sister."
"Rachel";"Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the"
"Tag";"So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in theafternoon?"
"Rachel";"In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He putthem on my desk, and then I put a"
"Tag";"It’s not here."
"Rachel";"Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room,maybe you left the contracts in there?"
"Tag";"How could I have left them in the copy room?"
"Rachel";"I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay?It’s not a perfect world! Just go please."
"Tag";"Fine."
"Rachel";"Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottomdrawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up thephone.) I still don’t get it."
"Monica";"Are you still awake?"
"Chandler";"Yeah! You?"
"Monica";"You do know that was me who just said that right? (He doesn’trespond and she turns on the light, waking him.) Hey. As long as we’re both up…"
"Chandler";"(intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope you’re not thinkingabout cleaning the living room."
"Joey";"Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Doyou want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!"
"Ross";"(looking in the window behind them) Y’know, y’know I’mlookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break thewindow, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later."
"Joey";"Yeah? Really? No one’s home?"
"Ross";"I don’t think so. Hello? (Knocks on the glass, which angers the big,large, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of thelanding.) When you get in there… (Joey nods his disapproval.)"
"Phoebe";"Okay, this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into thechute.) Noisy bitch!"
"Monica";"What?! What are you doing?!"
"Chandler";"Do you know what just happened?"
"Monica";"Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep."
"Chandler";"No. We were in the middle of sex…and"
"Monica";"Nooo! No, that’s not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked meworld! (She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)"
"Chandler";"(turning the light back on) Monica?"
"Monica";"What?!"
"Chandler";"I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So pleasewake up so"
"Monica";"Okay. Okay, I’m ready. Come on big fella!"
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Monica";"Give me the good stuff."
"Chandler";"Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Don’t fall asleep! Okay,I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesn’t move as he gets out of bed and ashe’s heading for the door.) And I probably won’t spill coffee grounds all overthe kitchen floor."
"Monica";"Okay, I’m up! I’m up!"
"Rachel";"Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh… (She looks for a place to set iton his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) …fair enough. So! Doyou got anything for me?"
"Tag";"Still no luck."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check"
"Tag";"Do you want me to check again?"
"Rachel";"Well yeah, I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well, noit’s not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom oneand he opens it. She doesn’t see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)"
"Tag";"Well, it’s not out here. Is there any chance it could be in youroffice?"
"Rachel";"(thinks) Y’know, I don’t-I don’t know. Let me, let mecheck. (As she heads for her office, she stops glances over her should at Tag, looks intoher office, and finds the folder on her desk.)"
"Tag";"(smirking) Any luck?"
"Rachel";"Can I see you in my office for a minute?"
"Tag";"(entering) Yeah? (She holds up the folder) You found them!! (Rachel is notamused, because she’s still going to try to blame him for her mistake like every‘good’ boss.) Y’know what? I’m not even going to gloat. I’m justreally relived this whole thing is over."
"Rachel";"You put these on my desk!"
"Tag";"I did not!"
"Rachel";"Oh really? So you’re saying they just"
"Tag";"How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?"
"Rachel";"(pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) Iam so hot for you right now."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! How did you get back here?!"
"A Disembodied Voice";"(yelling through the door) Phoebe Buffay?!"
"Phoebe";"(scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding theblanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi, officer—fireman, can-can I help you?"
"The Fireman";"We found your fire alarm in the trash chute."
"Phoebe";"That’s not mine."
"The Fireman";"Yes it is."
"Phoebe";"How do you know?"
"The Fireman";"The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute,don’t wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay notMonica.""
"Phoebe";"Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the lasttime I checked this was still America!"
"The Fireman";"Please reattach this, it’s against the law to disconnect them."
"Phoebe";"Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop themfrom going off!"
"The Fireman";"There’s a reset button under the plastic cover."
"Phoebe";"There’s a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! (He exits andshe goes to shut it off.) There’s a reset button! My God! Why didn’t I see that!(She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button, reset button,where is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.)Oh! (She presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached tothe detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh,God!"
"Ross";"Okay, do-do you have a good grip?"
"Joey";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"Okay, I’m going to start climb down you now."
"Joey";"All right! Just hurry up!"
"Ross";"Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face toface or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face."
"Joey";"I think face to face."
"Ross";"I would say that."
"Joey";"Face to face, yeah!"
"Ross";"Okay, here I go."
"Joey";"All right."
"Joey";"(grunting) Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!"
"Ross";"I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a littleholiday weight."
"Joey";"Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think wethought it all the way through."
"Ross";"So what do you want me to do?"
"Joey";"Well, just shimmy down me and drop!"
"Ross";"Hi."
"Joey";"Hi."
"Ross";"(looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me."
"Joey";"(angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!"
"Ross";"It’s still looks pretty far!"
"Joey";"It’s not that far! Just drop!"
"Ross";"Do not"
"Joey";"Ross, you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down andI’m not wearing any underwear!"
"Ross";"Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it whenI—Ooh, a quarter!"
"Monica";"That really was some of your best work."
"Chandler";"Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I can’t believe thatI’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work."
"Monica";"I have to be up in seven minutes."
"Chandler";"Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have sevenminutes…"
"Monica";"Really?!"
"Chandler";"Do you wanna?"
"Monica";"Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!"
"Joey";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Joey";"What are you doing?"
"Rachel";"Well, y’know I was thinking of moving the couch over here."
"Joey";"(laughs) Why would you want to do that?"
"Rachel";"So that there will be a decent place for me to sit."
"Joey";"Rach, there"
"Rachel";"And your"
"Joey";"No. No. No."
"Rachel";"No?"
"Joey";"No. Rosita does not move."
"Rachel";"I’m sorry, Rosita? As in…"
"Joey";"As in Rosita does not move."
"Rachel";"Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?"
"Joey";"The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom tothe kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming ofoff Stevie."
"Rachel";"Stevie the TV?"
"Joey";"(glaring at her) Is there a problem?"
"Rachel";"No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.)Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pullingon the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You bitch!"
"Ross";"Hey, y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married, when youintroduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-lawRoss." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That’sweird isn’t it?"
"Chandler";"Couldn’t I just say, "This is Ross?""
"Ross";"(disappointed) Sure, do whatever you want."
"Monica";"(entering, carrying a newspaper) Hey Ross! So, I was checking out theuh, real estate section…"
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Monica";"Look at this. (Hands him the newspaper.)"
"Ross";"Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh, it even has a tree with abroken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is…Oh my God!!"
"Phoebe";"What? What happened to the window in the attic?!"
"Monica";"I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!"
"Ross";"I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!"
"Phoebe";"I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the"
"Ross";"(on phone) Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!(Listens) Yes we’re surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?"
"Chandler";"(knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)"
"Rachel";"Joey, Joey I am so sorry."
"Joey";"I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted tomove you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her"
"Rachel";"Okay, come on—Joey, I’ll buy you a new one! All right?We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair."
"Joey";"(slowly turning and glaring at her) She’s not even cold yet!"
"Rachel";"But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? Imean y’know, she did always put…your comfort first."
"Joey";"That’s true."
"Rachel";"(grabbing her coat) Okay? You ready?"
"Joey";"Yeah, I… (Shuts off the TV.) I don’t want Stevie to see her likethis."
"Ross";"I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in.Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in"
"Monica";"Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you,it’s time the velvet ropes came down."
"Ross";"They kept your room for a while."
"Monica";"Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! Igotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of"
"Ross";"Come on, you know they love you."
"Monica";"As much as they love you?"
"Ross";"I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not myfault."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey."
"Ross";"Hey."
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Ugh, I hate this year!"
"Ross";"What’s wrong with this year?"
"Phoebe";"Well okay, it’s already February and I’ve only given twomassages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!"
"Monica";"That was me and Ross."
"Phoebe";"Oh that’s right!"
"Ross";"Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends ofmine made good money doing telemarketing."
"Monica";"Oh that’s a great idea. You’re really good on the phone."
"Phoebe";"Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephonejob I had. Y’know, I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much. (Monica andRoss are shocked.)"
"Ross";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah, like you never called!"
"Supervisor";"So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try tosell as much toner as you possibly can."
"Phoebe";"Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I"
"Supervisor";"(laughs) Why don’t we do a trial run."
"Phoebe";"Oh okay. Umm, all right. (Picks up the phone and starts reading from thescript.) Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supplymanager please?"
"Supervisor";"I’m the supply manager."
"Phoebe";"Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs."
"Supervisor";"We don’t need any toner."
"Phoebe";"Oh okay, well I’m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. (Hangs up thephone.) Yeah you’re right, this is easy."
"Supervisor";"Okay, what was wrong with that call?"
"Phoebe";"Oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you were kind of rude."
"Supervisor";"They’re always going to tell you they don’t need toner,but that’s okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in thisscript."
"Phoebe";"Oh."
"Supervisor";"So, I think you’re ready to sell toner, do you have any lastquestions?"
"Phoebe";"No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?"
"Chandler";"Joey! Joe! (Sees that he’s not here and starts investigating. Hepicks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beer’s still cold.Something"
"Ross";"Dad?"
"Mr. Geller";"I’m here!"
"Ross";"(entering with Monica) Hey!"
"Mr. Geller";"Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out towatch me work."
"Ross";"Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house."
"Mr. Geller";"Well, it’s time for a new family to start their memories hereand hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and theasbestos in the ceiling."
"Ross";"(To Monica) Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here."
"Mr. Geller";"I’m sorry we can’t store your childhood things anymore."
"Monica";"Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All ofthe memories…"
"Mr. Geller";"Well, I don’t know what’s in the boxes down here, but I doknow there are six or seven"
"Monica";"I used to"
"Ross";"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater."
"Monica";"Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a"
"Mr. Geller";"So, I think you’re boxes are over here. (They walk over tothem.)"
"Ross";"Wow! Great! (Finds a pack of cigarettes.) Wait, dad who-who’scigarettes are these?"
"Mr. Geller";"I don’t know. They-they must be your mother’s, but please,please don’t ask her. I’ll throw these away. (He puts them in his pocket as Rossfinds something of interest in one of his boxes.)"
"Ross";"Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, (reading his grades)Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym…(He puts it away and finds something else.)Oooh, my"
"Mr. Geller";"Oh look, look there’s your old makeup kit!"
"Ross";"It’s a clown kit! Clown kit!"
"Mr. Geller";"Well, the white seems to be untouched. (He throws it back into thebox as Mr. Geller moves a tarp and makes a discovery.) Uh-oh."
"Ross";"What?"
"Mr. Geller";"Y’know how the garage floods every Spring?"
"Ross";"How are you ever going to sell this place?"
"Mr. Geller";"I think I accidentally used Monica’s boxes to keep the wateraway from the"
"Ross";"Oh no. Dad! Dad! What…(He goes to open one of her boxes and it ripsapart.) Oh God…everything’s ruined! Dad, she’s gonna be crushed!"
"Mr. Geller";"You don’t secretly smoke do you?"
"Ross";"No!"
"Mr. Geller";"So it’s just your mother then."
"Phoebe";"(on phone) Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak toyour supply manager please? (Listens) Earl, thanks. (Listens) Hi Earl, this is Phoebe fromEmpire Office Supplies I’d like to talk to you about your toner needs. (She’sreading from the script.)"
"Earl";"I don’t need any toner."
"Phoebe";"I’m hearing what you’re saying, but at our prices everyoneneeds toner."
"Earl";"Not me."
"Phoebe";"May I ask why?"
"Earl";"You wanna know why. You wanna know why?"
"Phoebe";"I surely do!"
"Earl";"Okay, I don’t need any toner because I’m going to kill myself."
"Phoebe";"(doesn’t have any luck) Umm, is-is that because you’re out oftoner?"
"Earl";"Okay, so…no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye."
"Phoebe";"No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk tome."
"Earl";"Well…I only have one thing to do today. (He looks at his board in hisoffice that reads, "Today’s Tasks: KILL SELF.") I guess I could push itback."
"Phoebe";"Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?"
"Earl";"It’s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at thismeaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!"
"Phoebe";"Chandler?"
"Earl";"I-I’m sorry?"
"Phoebe";"No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!"
"Earl";"Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. I’ve been talkingto you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one’s even looked up fromtheir desk. Hang-hang on. (To the people standing around his cubicle.) Hey everybody! Uh,I’m gonna kill myself! (There’s no response; no one even looks up.) I’llget back to ya. (To Phoebe) I got nothing. Wait. (He sets the phone down.) Uh, hey Marge!(Mimes putting a gun to his head, pulling the trigger, and splattering his brain on thewall behind him. Then points to himself. Marge watches this, then goes back to work.) (ToPhoebe) Ehh, nothing. Nothing."
"Chandler";"My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! (He runs out thedoor, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are comingup the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)"
"Rachel";"You will like it!"
"Joey";"No I won’t."
"Rachel";"You don’t even know!"
"Joey";"Because, I know what I like and what I don’t like! It’s not thesame thing!"
"Rachel";"Well look, if you don’t like this…(The audience’slaughter at Chandler’s progress cuts out the rest of Rachel’s line.)"
"Joey";"I don’t know why you say that so soon."
"Rachel";"Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one inthe store! Hey, y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette."
"Joey";"Francette? What is she? A couch?"
"Joey";"Poor thing. Cut down in her prime."
"Rachel";"Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actuallymove Rosita out of here. Y’know, start the heeling process?"
"Joey";"Well, I guess you’re right. Maybe, maybe I’ll take her down tothe incinerator. It’s gonna be so said, and kinda cool. (He goes to remove the back,but it doesn’t come off. So he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, andlooks back at it.) She’s heeled!"
"Rachel";"That’s weird."
"Joey";"No it’s not weird, it’s a miracle!"
"Rachel";"It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s someexplanation."
"Joey";"Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrousthings can happen!"
"Rachel";"Joey, I really don’t…"
"Joey";"(interrupting her) Can you tell me how this happened?"
"Rachel";"Well no."
"Joey";"Miracle!"
"Rachel";"No, y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Orsomething!"
"Joey";"Someone like an…angel?"
"Rachel";"That’s right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.(She sits down in the chair.)"
"Joey";"(angrily) Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and headsfor her room.)"
"Mr. Geller";"Well, she’ll understand right? It’s not like I did it onpurpose."
"Ross";"Dad that won’t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry andall her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes herthink you guys love me more than you love her."
"Mr. Geller";"Oh my God, does she really thinks that?"
"Ross";"Well, can you blame her?"
"Mr. Geller";"Well I don’t know, I-I suppose we may have favored youunconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could…"
"Ross";"Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it."
"Mr. Geller";"Really?"
"Ross";"Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories anddamnit, we’re gonna give her some! Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay?We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as herswe’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their."
"Mr. Geller";"Great!"
"Ross";"Like uh y’know like this! This! (He picks up one of those artprojects that kids make in kindergarten and first grade.) She-she could’ve made this!"
"Mr. Geller";"Sure!"
"Ross";"Right? And this! (He picks up a trophy) She-she could’ve won this!"
"Mr. Geller";"(grabbing a glove) This could’ve been hers!"
"Ross";"Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?"
"Mr. Geller";"Your make-up kit? I’d feel better."
"Rachel";"(grabbing a beer out of the chair’s fridge) I am so psyched I keptthis chair for myself!"
"Joey";"Yeah, me too. (He flips up his armrest in disgust.)"
"Rachel";"Hey, how’s…how’s the uh, miracle chair?"
"Joey";"Fine."
"Rachel";"Yeah? Wow! Y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!"
"Joey";"No. Really?"
"Rachel";"Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV"
"Joey";"(quietly) My chair heels itself."
"Phoebe";"Earl, you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is thatyou’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! (One of hercoworkers overhears that, and she mimes that she didn’t mean him.)"
"Phoebe";"Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you."
"Earl";"No! That’s just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that toeverybody! He’s the worst! I’d like to take him with me!"
"Phoebe";"All right so Earl, let’s just forget about the people at theoffice, okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking aroundfor! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?"
"Earl";"(laughs) Yeah! Right!"
"Phoebe";"Oh sorry, boyfriend!"
"Earl";"Oh no."
"Phoebe";"No, whatever! Anything!"
"The "Hey Guy" Guy";"Hey guy!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, he’s gotta go."
"Earl";"Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.(Hangs up.)"
"Phoebe";"No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t! Don’t you dare hang upon me!!!"
"Supervisor";"(walking by and overhearing that) (to the rest of the staff) The newgirl’s good."
"Monica";"Hey guys! Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey."
"Monica";"Hey, I just whipped us up some"
"Mr. Geller";"(overacting) That’s a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Threedays!"
"Ross";"(overacting as well) Yeah! Yeah! (Laughs.) Oh, this will make a greatmemory."
"Monica";"(wary) Okay. So, which boxes are mine?"
"Ross";"Well, these. These are yours right here. (Pointing to the boxes they justcreated for her.)"
"Monica";"Okay. (Starting to go through them) Oh! A coloring book! (Holding itup.)"
"Ross";"Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You neverwent anywhere without-without that coloring book."
"Monica";"(looking through it) Really? Wow! It looks like I had some troublestaying inside the lines."
"Ross";"Nu-uh! (Grabs it and examines it.)"
"Monica";"(holding up a glove) Oh, an old glove?"
"Mr. Geller";"Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. Younever went any place without that glove."
"Monica";"Wow! Look at this! (Picking up a shirt.) I can’t believe I even fitinto this shirt! (She holds it up and it reads: Tyrannosaurus Ross.) (She turns it aroundand looks at it.) Oh, this is yours. (Hands it to Ross.)"
"Ross";"Oh, I don’t know how that got in there."
"Monica";"(holding up a small cowboy hat) This isn’t mine. (Sets it down andlooks at the rest of the boxes.) Hey, this isn’t, this isn’t my stuff! Ugh,Ross! (Grabs and holds up a doll.) These are"
"Ross";"Umm, your boxes are umm…"
"Monica";"What?"
"Ross";"Dad?"
"Mr. Geller";"Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in yourboxes. I’m sorry."
"Monica";"Just mine?"
"Mr. Geller";"I’m afraid so."
"Monica";"So why-why wasn’t Ross’s stuff ruined? (Pause) And if you saythe words medical marvel I’m going to"
"Mr. Geller";"Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the"
"Monica";"So wait, Ross’s stuff is fine, but I have no memories because youwanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!"
"Mr. Geller";"There was also leaves and guk and stuff."
"Monica";"I can’t believe this! (Storms out.)"
"Mr. Geller";"(To Ross) Screw it! I’m having one. (Takes out and lights acigarette.)"
"Rachel";"Hey Chandler!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rollingmassage, and speakers in the head rest?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times theywon’t even let me in the store anymore."
"Rachel";"Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?"
"Chandler";"(excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that ismaking all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair ofthe Year?"
"Rachel";"I just purchased the"
"Chandler";"That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!"
"Rachel";"Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke Joey’s chair…"
"Chandler";"Whoa-whoa-whoa!"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"I thought"
"Rachel";"Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed!"
"Chandler";"Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?"
"Rachel";"Noo! (Laughs) Angels."
"Chandler";"I’m gettin’ my chair back! (Heads for Joey andRachel’s.)"
"Rachel";"What? Wh-hey!"
"Joey";"Well, it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guessthis chair is mine now! (Sits down in it and groans.)"
"Chandler";"Joey you broke my chair!!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!"
"Joey";"So, there was no miracle?!"
"Rachel";"No Joe, no miracle."
"Joey";"(sarcastic) Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I’m soglad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life."
"Rachel";"Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right?That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!"
"Chandler";"I think I should get the chair!"
"Joey";"How do you figure?"
"Chandler";"Because"
"Rachel";"No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere."
"Chandler";"Well, where’s the logic in that?!"
"Rachel";"The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough tobreak a chair in half!"
"Chandler";"So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!"
"Joey";"That’s right!"
"Chandler";"What are you guys? Like a"
"Joey";"Yeah! We are!"
"Rachel";"We’re the Cobras!"
"Phoebe";"(to Marge) Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He’sthe supply manager around here."
"Marge";"Sorry, I don’t know any Earl."
"Earl";"(screaming) I’m right here!!!!"
"Phoebe";"(goes over to his desk) Earl! I’m Phoebe."
"Earl";"Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?"
"Phoebe";"Umm, look it, you-you can’t kill yourself."
"Earl";"(exhales) Look, um I really appreciate your coming down…"
"Phoebe";"No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it!"
"Earl";"Why?!"
"Phoebe";"Because it was fate that made me call you today!"
"Earl";"I thought it was toner."
"Phoebe";"No! Think about it okay?"
"Earl";"Really?!"
"Phoebe";"Yes."
"Earl";"How?"
"Phoebe";"I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see thatthis-this…this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this."
"Earl";"Couldn’t it just be a coincidence?"
"Phoebe";"No, it’s fate!"
"Earl";"It doesn’t really seem like enough to be fate."
"Phoebe";"Oh. Well umm, okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also asupply manager."
"Earl";"I’m actually the office manager."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl,right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl."
"Earl";"Well, was there anything else?!"
"Phoebe";"Sure! (Thinks.) Umm, where are you from?"
"Earl";"Philadelphia."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I’ve got-I’ve got goose bumps. (Sheholds out her arm.)"
"Earl";"(inspecting it) Really?"
"Phoebe";"Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm."
"Earl";"Yeah-yeah."
"Phoebe";"But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but theuniverse does! And that says a lot!"
"Earl";"(To All) Did you hear that?! I don’t need you guys to care about me!Because the universe cares! The whole universe! (Laughs as everyone ignores him.) (ToPhoebe) I really wished they’d care just a little bit though."
"Phoebe";"Y’know, I don’t-I don’t think it’s you. This is afreaky place. (To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl) Oh no, it’s you."
"Earl";"Yeah."
"Monica";"Oh, this terrible!"
"Ross";"All right. I think it was a mouse."
"Mr. Geller";"(entering) How are you honey?"
"Monica";"How do you think I am?! You’ve wrecked all my childhood memories.You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!"
"Mr. Geller";"Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I’m sorryabout everything that happened and I’d probably never be able to make it up to you,but here’s a start. (He hands her a small box.)"
"Monica";"(opening it) What’s this?"
"Mr. Geller";"It’s the key to my"
"Monica";"(shocked) What?!"
"Ross";"(even more shocked) What?!!!"
"Mr. Geller";"I’ve been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving itthe other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother’s right, I"
"Monica";"Wait, you’re giving me your"
"Ross";"Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupidboxes get wet and she gets a"
"Mr. Geller";"(To Monica) Why don’t we take it for a spin?"
"Monica";"All right!"
"Ross";"Well, what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!!"
"Joey";"Oh yeah."
"Rachel";"Ahhhh…."
"Joey";"Ahhh…… (To Rachel) Eh?"
"Rachel";"Uh-huh."
"Monica";"(entering) Hey guys!"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Do you guys know what happened to Chandler’s barca lounger?"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it."
"Monica";"Are you kidding?! I get a"
"Ross";"Happy birthday!!!"
"Monica";"Happy birthday!!!"
"All";"Rach! Come on! Rach!"
"Monica";"It’s your birthday!"
"Tag";"(entering from her room) Hey."
"Chandler";"(To Monica) She’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29."
"Tag";"Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out.She would appreciate it if you don’t use the words old or downhill or (To Joey) theystill look pretty damn good. (Joey smiles and everyone glares at him.)"
"Joey";"They do!"
"Phoebe";"Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!"
"Monica";"Chocolate-chip pancakes!"
"Ross";"We’ve got presents!"
"Rachel";"Good ones?"
"Monica";"They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago."
"Rachel";"Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?"
"Joey";"Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal."
"Ross";"Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?"
"Joey";"(screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Notme!! (He buries his head in Phoebe’s lap for comfort.)"
"Rachel";"Y’know, I’m still 29 in Guam."
"Ross";"Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?"
"Rachel";"Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting tothis?"
"Chandler";"No Rach, it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainlywasn’t that much fun."
"Joey";"(screaming) And now Chandler! We’re all gettin’ so old! (Lookingup) Why are you doing this to us?! (Turns away crying.)"
"Monica";"Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’vegot a great job! Good friends…"
"Joey";"Yeah, you’re roommate is a soap opera star."
"Rachel";"Look, y’know I know my life’s going pretty well, but I lookaround and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by thetime they’re thirty."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me."
"All";"Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!"
"Rachel";"There you go!"
"Phoebe";"I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That’s it!! That’severything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up withmy sister. But oh well. Yay!! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is aGodsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look intrigued and as they all headinto Central Perk, Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)"
"Rachel";"Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs.Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!"
"Tag";"Come on, let’s have some fun. Huh? (To Rachel) What do you want to dotoday?"
"Rachel";"Nothing. I don’t want to do anything."
"Monica";"Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing somethingstupid, like Ross."
"Ross";"Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation!Okay? I-I have a child!"
"Ross";"How hot do I look in this, huh?!"
"Chandler";"Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff asock down there?"
"Ross";"That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. Ihave"
"Joey";"Hey, what’s the horsepower on this thing?"
"Ross";"(giddy) I don’t know, but-but look how shiny!"
"Monica";"I can’t believe you bought this."
"Rachel";"Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? (To Phoebe, quietly) I knowit’s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again."
"Phoebe";"Oh, well get in line missy. (To Ross) So, can I have a ride stud?"
"Ross";"Hop in. (Phoebe hops in.) Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life."
"Ross";"Damnit! (Shuts the car off.)"
"Phoebe";"(getting out) Okay, who’s next?"
"Rachel";"Y’know what? I am going to do something today. I’m not justgonna sit around like some old lady. I’m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh,like my nose or my tongue or something."
"Phoebe";"Really?! ‘Cause y’know that hurts."
"Rachel";"So what?! Y’know what? The way I see it—(Phoebe pulls out ahair from the back of her head)—Ow! Son of a bitch!!"
"Tag";"Look Rachel, I know what you’re going through. I’m totallyfreaked about turning 25."
"Rachel";"(glares at him) Get out, get out of my apartment."
"Monica";"All right Rach, for what it’s worth, I think that you’re doinggreat. I mean y’know let’s face it, no one handles this well."
"Phoebe";"Least of all you."
"Tag";"Why? What you’d do?"
"Monica";"Weren’t you asked to leave sonny?"
"Chandler";"(To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monica’s gonna be here anyminute!"
"Joey";"But it hurt’s my Joey’s Apple."
"Chandler";"(frustrated) Okay, for the last time. It’s not named for eachindividual man."
"Mrs. Geller";"(To Chandler) You’ve done a wonderful job with this partyChandler. Everything looks so lovely."
"Chandler";"Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can’t believe that youwould have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I can’t believe thatyou would have a tux that’s thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Geller’sshoulder.)"
"Mr. Geller";"It’s older than that. Ross was actually conceived right nearthis tuxedo."
"Chandler";"Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)"
"Rachel";"(entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She’s coming!"
"Chandler";"Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off thelights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from theassemblage.)"
"Mr. Geller";"Crap."
"Chandler";"(getting up to investigate) Okay, everybody stay here. I will find outwhat’s going on."
"Monica";"Heyyy!! You got the door open!! (Giggles.)"
"Chandler";"Hey-hey are you drunk?"
"Monica";"Nooo! (Giggles) Okay. (She tries to pull herself up by Rachel andJoey’s doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment.She manages to catch herself.) Whoa! (Stands up, unsteadily) Okay. See I was, I was alittle nervous about turning (whispering) thirty. (Giggles.) So the bus boys took me outfor some drinks. (Pause) I wanna puke on you later!"
"Chandler";"Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a"
"Monica";"Noo!!!"
"Chandler";"Yes!"
"Monica";"Noo!!"
"Chandler";"Yes!!"
"Monica";"Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! (Pause) That they know of."
"Chandler";"Okay, here’s the thing. We’re gonna get you some coffee andthey will never know that you’re drunk."
"Monica";"Really?! You promise?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I’ll take care of it."
"Monica";"Okay. I love you so much. (Kisses him.)"
"Chandler";"(laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath."
"Monica";"What about"
"Chandler";"That’s still yours. Okay, now remember it’s a surpriseparty. So, when you go in, act surprised."
"Monica";"Okay. I can do that."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"All";"Surprise!!!"
"Ross";"Okay, forward. Forward—Stop! (The car moves an inch and Ross runs tothe back of the car.) Okay, back—Stop! (The car barely moves and Ross runs back tothe front.) Okay, forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!"
"Monica";"Ross, just forget about it. This guy’s got you totally wedged in."
"Woman";"(To Joey) Is this yours?"
"Joey";"Well actually…"
"Ross";"No-no-no! It’s mine! It’s-it’s mine. (The woman walksaway.)"
"Joey";"Dude, you soooo need this car."
"Phoebe";"(running up) Okay. Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. Okay,I’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward soRoss can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. (She opens her coat andreveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel.She inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) Haul ass!!!!(Runs off.)"
"Phoebe";"Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! (Hands her the hippity-hop.) It’sfor the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!"
"Ursula";"Right, why do you keep saying that?"
"Phoebe";"Because it’s our thirtieth birthday."
"Ursula";"Yeah, no we’re not thirty. We’re 31. Okay. (She closes thedoor.)"
"Phoebe";"Wait! (Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.)"
"Ursula";"Oh, it’s you."
"Phoebe";"Yeah. What?!"
"Ursula";"Yeah, we’re not thirty, we’re 31."
"Phoebe";"Nu-uh!"
"Ursula";"Yea-huh! That’s what is says on my birth certificate."
"Phoebe";"You have your birth certificate?"
"Ursula";"Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died."
"Phoebe";"Our mom."
"Ursula";"(sarcastic) Right! Okay. (Hands Phoebe her births certificate.)"
"Phoebe";"Do you have my birth certificate?"
"Ursula";"No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway."
"Phoebe";"(reading the certificate) Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31."
"Ursula";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"I just lost a whole year of my life."
"Ursula";"(sarcastic) Okay."
"Phoebe";"Your middle name is Pamela?"
"Ursula";"Yes."
"Phoebe";"Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?"
"Ursula";"Yes! Phoebe."
"Phoebe";"That’s my first name."
"Ursula";"Right, okay, then no."
"Chandler";"Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on herparty dress."
"Monica";"Yay!"
"Chandler";"See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room,and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller who’s sitting at the table and Mrs. Gellerwho’s standing next to him.)"
"Mr. Geller";"Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug! (Starts to get up.)"
"Mrs. Geller";"(stopping him) Don’t get up Jack! The safety pins are about toblow."
"Monica";"(sees someone) Paul!"
"Chandler";"(correcting her) Phil."
"Monica";"Phil!"
"Chandler";"Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on thesteps.) Okay, (catches her) you’re doing great. You’re doing great. You’redoing fine."
"Phoebe";"Hey, what’s going on?"
"Chandler";"Monica’s a little drunk."
"Phoebe";"Yay! I"
"Monica";"Awwwww… (Giggles.)"
"Chandler";"(To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesn’t want her parentsto know she’s drunk."
"Phoebe";"Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do, I’ll gettwice as drunk as Monica and then no one’s will even notice her."
"Rachel";"What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!"
"Chandler";"Monica’s wasted."
"Ross";"Maybe that will liven up this party."
"Chandler";"(To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!"
"Rachel";"Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey."
"Joey";"Yep. (Starts for Monica’s room, but Chandler stops him.)"
"Tag";"(handing his to her) This one’s from me."
"Rachel";"Ahh!"
"Tag";"It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’sreally fun."
"Rachel";"(opening it) A scooter! (She’s not happy.)"
"Ross";"(to Tag) Stick to the list. Always stick to the list."
"Rachel";"No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.)"
"Chandler";"Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!"
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Joey";"Now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from youguys?"
"Chandler";"For my last birthday you gave me a"
"Rachel";"Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! It’sbetter to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down aseveryone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) That’s funny,yeah!"
"Chandler";"No-no-no-no! That was the joke!"
"Rachel";"(crying) No, I know! I get it! It’s funny!"
"Chandler";"No, because you’re not a grandmother!"
"Rachel";"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and havechildren and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny.(Runs into her room crying.)"
"Monica";"All you had to do was buy the card!"
"Ross";"Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s thebirthday girl feeling?"
"Rachel";"Well, I feel fine, but I think you’re bumming out the rest of thekids."
"Ross";"What? (Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goesand sits down.)"
"Rachel";"Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about nothaving a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have threekids…"
"Phoebe";"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and youwanna have them for your brother."
"Rachel";"As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kidsby the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry thisplan!"
"Phoebe";"If you could do that, I’d marry the hippity-hop."
"Rachel";"So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I don’t have to getpregnant until I’m 34. Which gives"
"Monica";"Really! That long?! (Chandler slowly turns and looks at her.) (ToChandler) Look all you want, it’s happening!"
"Rachel";"No, so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’sthree years, that’s three whole years—Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need ayear and a half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a year, yearand a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the timeI’m thirty."
"Ross";"Which is fine! Because"
"Rachel";"No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I shouldalready be with the guy I wanna marry!"
"Joey";"Will you quit hoggin’ it!"
"Rachel";"(To Chandler) I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learnhow to walk."
"Ross";"(To Monica) You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! MaybeI’m a little drunk."
"Chandler";"(to a waiter) Oh that’s great! Right there! Can we get some ofthat over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go."
"Joey";"(to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I nottell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?"
"Chandler";"(To Monica) How are you feeling?"
"Monica";"You are"
"Ross";"I really wish that you wouldn’t."
"Chandler";"(To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bitmore, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don’t talk to"
"Phoebe";"(clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from thebirthday girl! Huh?"
"Chandler";"Pheebs!!"
"Phoebe";"Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’sworking! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!"
"Mrs. Geller";"Speech! Come on Monica!"
"Ross";"Come on!"
"All";"Come on! Speech!"
"Mr. Geller";"(filming this) Hey Chandler, you can’t keep your hands off herfor one second!"
"Mrs. Geller";"Oh-ho, I think it’s nice."
"Chandler";"I think it’s necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)"
"Monica";"I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends…"
"Phoebe";"(screaming) Wooo!! Hoo!!"
"Monica";"I really like to say that I’m-um… (Pause) Y’know whatI’d really like to say? I’m drunk!! (Mrs. Geller pulls the camera down.)That’s right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! (Ross grabs the cameraout of his dad’s hands.) And guess what! I’ve been drunk before! And I’vesmoked a cigarette! And I got a box of"
"Phoebe";"(To Joey) Okay quick, help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)"
"Joey";"Yeah!!"
"Phoebe";"I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!"
"Joey";"Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay."
"Phoebe";"Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were31?"
"Joey";"That’s not gonna happen. No. (Looks up) Because we have a new deal!"
"Phoebe";"Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any ofthe things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!"
"Joey";"Like what?"
"Phoebe";"Like okay I-I-I, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, Ihaven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!"
"Monica";"Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have somebirthday cake?"
"Phoebe";"No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’llsee you guys later. Thanks. (Gets up and exits.)"
"Rachel";"Hey. (After she leaves.) Oh, poor Pheebs."
"Joey";"Hey, y’know what you guys? I think I’m gonna go walk her home.(Gets up and runs out.)"
"Monica";"Oh man!"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Monica";"He’s gonna eat the cake!"
"Joey";"Pheebs! Wait up! (She stops.) Listen uh, close your eyes. (She does so andJoey passionately kisses her.) Maybe that’s one thing you can cross off your list."
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah."
"Joey";"Oh, and plus I’m 1/16"
"Phoebe";"Oh! (Phoebe walks away smiling.)"
"Ross";"Okay, is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it.Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We’re gonna"
"Rachel";"Ross, I really don’t think…"
"Ross";"(interrupting her) Lift!! And slide!"
"Chandler";"Okay, here we go."
"Ross";"All right everyone, lift! (They and try to lift the car, of course itdoesn’t raise up) And slide!! (Everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.)"
"Rachel";"Hey Joey, can I…"
"Joey";"Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!"
"Rachel";"Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag."
"Joey";"Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?"
"Rachel";"Whatever! Okay, I’m not your mother."
"Joey";"Okay! (Runs off downstairs.)"
"Rachel";"Not in the street!!"
"Joey";"Yes!"
"Rachel";"(to Tag) Hi."
"Tag";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Tag";"How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I’m doing okay. I’m um…let’s talk."
"Tag";"Okay. (They sit on the step.)"
"Rachel";"Umm…"
"Tag";"What’s up?"
"Rachel";"Ohh Tag, umm…you’re such a great guy and we have sooo much funtogether but I don’t-I don’t…"
"Tag";"Wait! I think I see where you’re going, but before you say anythingelse, can I just say one more thing? (Kisses her.)"
"Rachel";"Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, butI just think I’m past the point where I think I can y’know, just have fun."
"Tag";"Rachel, don’t do this. This is just because you’re turningthirty."
"Rachel";"Yeah, it is! But you’re just a kid! I mean you’re 25!"
"Tag";"Twenty-four actually."
"Rachel";"Oh God! Y’know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Wellactually, if I’m wishin’ for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger."
"Tag";"Me too."
"Rachel";"Yeah, I’m sorry. (They hug.)"
"Chandler";"Hey! How’d it go?"
"Rachel";"Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?"
"Phoebe";"You did the right thing."
"Joey";"(entering, limping, and holding his arm) I don’t like this anymore.(He sits down with them in pain.)"
"Chandler";"Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds."
"Ross";"God, do you realize in ten years we’re gonna be 40?"
"Joey";"(crying) Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! (He buries his head inRoss’s shoulder.)"
"Ross";"Yes! My baby’s finally free!"
"Joey";"All-all right! (They run and jump in the car.) Start it up! Let’s go!"
"Ross";"(starting it) Woohoo!"
"The Man In The Sportscar";"How hot are we? (He drives off.)"
"Ross";"You wanna buy a car?"
"Joey";"No."
"Monica";"I’m glad you’re here, we have a couple of things to ask youabout the wedding ceremony."
"Rachel";"(starting to cry) Ohh…"
"Ross";"What’s the matter? You okay?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, it’s just y’know…"
"Chandler";"(To Ross) Monica said wedding."
"Monica";"Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during theceremony."
"Rachel";"Oh! I would love to read a poem."
"Chandler";"Do you think you could get through a poem?"
"Rachel";"(crying) It’ll be a short one."
"Monica";"Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading."
"Rachel";"Ohhh…"
"Ross";"Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too."
"Chandler";"Too?"
"Ross";"Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys."
"Monica";"Do you mind telling us what it is?"
"Ross";"Sorry, I’m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T."
"Chandler";"Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-typemanner.)"
"Joey";"(entering, excited) Hey!"
"All";"Hey!"
"Joey";"So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and…"
"Monica";"What is DOOL?"
"All";"Oh!!"
"Chandler";"That’s great!"
"Joey";"And-and-and not only that, I’m gettin’ a new brain!!"
"Chandler";"So great things are happening at work"
"Rachel";"Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?"
"Joey";"Oh well, they’re killing off one of the characters on the show, andwhen she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body."
"Ross";"What? A brain transplant?!"
"Joey";"(seriously) Yes, it’s a highly controversial procedure."
"Ross";"It’s ridiculous!"
"Joey";"Well, I think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had sex in threeand a half months."
"Ross";"(to Monica and Rachel) It’s winter, they are fewer people on thestreet. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod, knowingly.)"
"Monica";"Who are they killing off?"
"Joey";"Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart."
"Rachel and Monica";"Noo!!"
"Monica";"She’s my favorite character on DOOL."
"Joey";"Nice."
"Rachel";"She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean Idon’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage."
"Monica";"And the way she slaps all the time!"
"Rachel";"Oh!"
"Monica";"Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?! (Raises her hand towardsChandler.)"
"Chandler";"Don’t do it."
"Rachel";"Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress."
"Joey";"Oh, tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever, it’sgonna be really hard to fill her shoes."
"Ross";"Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "braintransplant," you are going to be her?"
"Joey";"Yes, but in Drake Remoray’s body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why isthis so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!"
"Phoebe";"(Clears Throat) Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?"
"Rachel";"(They both look behind them.) Well, I'd have to say gay."
"Phoebe";"Yeah? Why?"
"Rachel";"Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy."
"Phoebe";"Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to anattractive man sitting at a table behind them.)"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight."
"Phoebe";"(A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help usfigure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)"
"Rachel";"All right, straight, and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)"
"Phoebe";"Ohh, he left his cell phone."
"Rachel";"Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found."
"Phoebe";"Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing."
"Rachel";"What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it andI answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story?Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age."
"Phoebe";"Yeah… That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. (They bothget up.)"
"Rachel";"What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?"
"Phoebe";"I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long."
"Rachel";"Phoebe, you had a date three days ago."
"Phoebe";"That wasn’t a date! That was, that was just friends gettingtogether…(quietly) having sex."
"Rachel";"Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone."
"Phoebe";"No way! No way! You"
"Rachel";"Yeah! (Breaking up) And until now, I didn’t think I’d loveagain."
"Phoebe";"Nice try."
"Rachel";"Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?"
"Phoebe";"I don’t know."
"Rachel";"Well umm, maybe we could uhh… (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!!"
"Phoebe";"Ah-ha! Too cocky!"
"Dina";"I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you cando about it!"
"Jessica Lockhart";"Oh yes there is!"
"Dina";"What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!"
"Jessica Lockhart";"(gasps) That was an accident! And so were you."
"Dina";"Well, at least I’m not a murderer! (Jessica slaps her.)"
"Jessica Lockhart";"(crying) Oh, my baby! (Hugs Dina, but moves Dina’s headto her other shoulder so that she’s the only one in the picture.)"
"Joey";"That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you dothat?"
"Cecilia";"Oh, just years of experience."
"Dina";"(crying) Can I get some ice here?!"
"Joey";"Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are."
"Cecilia";"You’re not the fan who’s dying are you?"
"Joey";"Say what?"
"Cecilia";"I’m supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that’snot supposed to be until (to no one in particular) later!"
"Joey";"No. No, I’m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday.I-I’m the guy in the coma!"
"Cecilia";"Oh that was a real person?!"
"Joey";"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brainwhen you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me…"
"Cecilia";"I-I-I’m leaving the show?"
"Joey";"(quickly) I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?"
"Cecilia";"Who told you that?"
"Joey";"Oh uh, one of the writers."
"Cecilia";"Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?"
"Joey";"Umm…"
"Cecilia";"Y’know what? It doesn’t matter! Because it is not true!"
"Joey";"Okay."
"Cecilia";"And if it were true, how"
"Joey";"Ms. Monroe… (She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leavingJoey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they justreceived.)"
"Rachel";"No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okaylook, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he hason his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. Andthen whoever does gets the phone."
"Phoebe";"Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone."
"Rachel";"I don’t think so."
"Phoebe";"(handing Rachel the phone) Fine all right, but I’d bet you’dbe singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet."
"Rachel";"(checking the speed dial) All right, first name on the speed dial ismom."
"Phoebe";"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide."
"Rachel";"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the lastblueberry muffin."
"Phoebe";"Did I use that already today? I’m sorry."
"Rachel";"Yes okay. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isn’ttelling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! That’s a steak house!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you."
"Rachel";"(looking at the speed dial) Oh, I win! He’s got"
"Phoebe";"So you don’t know that’s"
"Rachel";"(showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!"
"Monica";"What is that?"
"Chandler";"I think it’s the dying cat parade."
"Monica";"It sounds like it’s coming from across the street."
"Chandler";"(turning around and looking) Oh my God!"
"Monica";"What?"
"Chandler";"Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He washanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You’re halfScottish right?""
"Monica";"Nooo!!"
"Chandler";"Yes!!"
"Monica";"No, there is no way! It can"
"Chandler";"Why is your family"
"Monica";"He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean comeon, that is just noise! It’s not even a song!"
"Chandler";"If you listen very carefully, I think its"
"Rachel";"Hi Pheebs!"
"Phoebe";"Hi!"
"Rachel";"How are ya?"
"Phoebe";"Good."
"Rachel";"Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that Iwas going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if itrang I could just pick it up?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah!"
"Rachel";"And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh, now you lost me."
"Rachel";"You stole the phone!"
"Phoebe";"No I didn’t!"
"Rachel";"No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring?"
"Phoebe";"No."
"Rachel";"Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my newringing handbag. (Rachel dials her phone and Phoebe’s bag starts to ring.) Oh, itdoes work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebe’s handbag.)"
"Rachel";"Phoebe!"
"Phoebe";"That is a different phone."
"Rachel";"Oh is it?! (She answers the cute guy’s phone.) Uhh, hello? (On herphone) Yes hi, is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is, just one moment please.(To Phoebe, holding out both phones.) It’s for me!"
"Phoebe";"That is damning evidence."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about tobegin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh (In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be(Happily) Hi! It’s Rach… (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachel’s hand,catches it, and answers it.) Would you stop doing that?!"
"Phoebe";"(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yes, I’m the one who found your phone."
"Rachel";"Phoebe! You can’t do th…"
"Phoebe";"(To Rachel) Shhh! I’m on a call! (On phone) Umm well yeah, you canpick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It’s umm, it’s umm 5 MortonStreet, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y’know after we can grab a bite to eat orwhatever. (Listens) Okay, well okay I’ll see you then. (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up.)"
"Rachel";"You do know that I will be here when he comes over."
"Phoebe";"Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?"
"Rachel";"You just said it!"
"Phoebe";"Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just…be aloney’know to think about my mom and her suicide."
"Rachel";"Oh Phoebe!"
"Phoebe";"What?! That’s the first time today!"
"Rachel";"Ohh! (Exits.)"
"Joey";"So you like the nachos uh? Myself I’m partial to…"
"Dina";"(interrupting) I’m 16."
"Joey";"See you in 2003. (She walks away.)"
"Cecilia";"(walking up) You’re absolutely right they are writing me out ofthe show. They don’t know exactly when it’s going to happen, but apparentlygoing to be very soon and that’s it."
"Joey";"I’m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave theshow."
"Cecilia";"Yeah, thanks."
"Joey";"No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to yourfans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!"
"Cecilia";"Oh you’re right. Thank you! What’s your name again?"
"Joey";"Joey."
"Cecilia";"Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me. (She throws herdrink on a passing writer.)"
"The Writer";"It wasn’t my decision!"
"Cecilia";"(to him) I’m having a conversation here! (To Joey) You weresaying?"
"Joey";"Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I,that I came up to you before was because well, I’m really nervous about-about beingyou. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know?Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?"
"Cecilia";"All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this"
"Joey";"Oh that’s great! Oh thank you so much!"
"Cecilia";"You’re so welcome."
"Joey";"Hey! Now, I’ve been watching some tapes, how’s this? (In aBritish accent.) "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again!Ever!!""
"Cecilia";"Is that supposed to be me?"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Cecilia";"Yeah but Jessica doesn’t have an English accent."
"Joey";"(shocked) I can do an English accent?! That baby’s going on myresume!"
"Chandler";"Well, I feel like a snack!"
"Monica";"Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are."
"Chandler";"Oh no thanks. I don’t like"
"Ross";"What?!"
"Chandler";"Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotlandby…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)"
"Ross";"Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover itsScottish roots."
"Monica";"No! No-no they’re not. They’re still very angry! Buty’know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famousfor? Sitting down and being quiet."
"Ross";"Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more…"
"Monica";"(interrupting) You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!"
"Ross";"How did you know about that?!"
"Chandler";"We heard you play all the way from your apartment!"
"Ross";"Were you the ones called the cops?!"
"Chandler";"That’s not really important right now. What is important is;while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for ourwedding."
"Ross";"Why not?"
"Chandler";"Because we hate them."
"Ross";"Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!"
"Chandler";"We"
"Ross";"No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance toperform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you whatsong I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’llbet there will be a we bit o’ celebration."
"Cecilia";"So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, whenJessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room.(Joey is nodding.) You try."
"Joey";"Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed)All right!"
"Cecilia";"No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He’s notfinding it out for the first time! So, try it again."
"Joey";"Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)"
"Cecilia";"Right. He’s not angry at the room either. Try it again, he ownsit! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns,"
"Joey";"Oh well—Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing.Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play differentcharacters. You’re so talented."
"Cecilia";"I am. I am, but I don’t know you know. An actor of a certain ageis not that easy."
"Joey";"Hey that’s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb—AngelinaJolie!"
"Cecilia";"I probably should’ve just left years ago when the offers werepouring in, but y’know I just got so comfy here! And… Ohh, I turned down someamazing work!"
"Joey";"Like-like what?"
"Cecilia";"Well, let’s just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape ofMexican cinema would be very different today!"
"Joey";"(impressed) Wow!"
"Cecilia";"But… Well now, now’s a different time for me. (Starts tocry.)"
"Joey";"Oh hey come on, don’t-don’t-don’t do this! Umm, looklet-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I’m thinking,"Boy, she-she is a great actress!" (She’s not buying it.) Uh but-but, I amalso thinking, "She is hot!""
"Cecilia";"(intrigued) You think I’m hot?"
"Joey";"You own the room. (She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) Weshould probably get-get uh…"
"Cecilia";"Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the… (Pause) So when Jessica kisses aman, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man’s face. (She does so.)"
"Joey";"Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate?"
"Cecilia";"No! It’s because that way the camera only sees her! (She takes herhands off his face.) Do you wanna try it?"
"Joey";"Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)"
"Cecilia";"That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe alittle off, they should be maybe right like… (She grabs the back of his neck andkisses him passionately causing them to fall onto the couch.)"
"Rachel";"Hey! Hey!"
"Phoebe and Rachel";"(simultaneously) Who is it?"
"Guy";"Hi! It’s Tom, I’m here to pick up the phone."
"Phoebe";"Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?"
"Rachel";"Well why shouldn’t I?!"
"Phoebe";"Because it’s my apartment!"
"Rachel";"Well, then I get to give him the cell phone."
"Phoebe";"Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all thecalls to China."
"Tom";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"(To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?"
"Rachel";"(laughs) You’re not the man who left the cell phone."
"Tom";"No that’s my assistant."
"Rachel";"Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)"
"Tom";"Umm, no."
"Phoebe";"Could you-could you umm, give us one second?"
"Tom";"Sure!"
"Rachel";"We’ll be right back sir."
"Tom";"Sure."
"Phoebe";"Wh-what do we do?"
"Rachel";"I don’t know!"
"Phoebe";"Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting fora hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!"
"Rachel";"I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!"
"Phoebe";"Hmm, they just don’t"
"Rachel";"(turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but, you just have towait."
"Phoebe";"Rachel, listen—I mean, if you let me have him then I will"
"Rachel";"(fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you havehim, but you owe me; you owe me big!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah! You’re such a great friend!"
"Rachel";"Ohh…"
"Tom";"So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?"
"Phoebe";"Oh that’d be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you."
"Tom";"Okay. Okay. (Exits and Phoebe checks him out.)"
"Phoebe";"(whispering) Nice!"
"Cecilia";"Well, you certainly own that room."
"Joey";"Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you."
"Rachel";"Hi."
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I amsuch a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!"
"Cecilia";"Well, it’s nice to know that you…"
"Rachel";"(screaming)"
"Joey";"That uh, that is my roommate Rachel."
"Cecilia";"Oh that explains all the women’s underwear."
"Joey";"(shrugs) Sure. Yep."
"Monica";"(entering with Rachel) Oh my God! It’s true!! Oh my God you are soamazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?"
"Cecilia";"Certainly."
"Monica";"Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! (Points toher cheek.)"
"Cecilia";"I’d love to, but my lawyer said I can’t do that anymore."
"Rachel";"God. You seem really, really nice."
"Joey";"Okay, bye-bye."
"Rachel";"I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people."
"Joey";"All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of theapartment.)"
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Monica";"(breaks away) Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! (ToCecilia) Umm, you’re a stupid bitch."
"Cecilia";"I really can’t slap you. (Monica walks away angrily)"
"Rachel";"You are so beautiful."
"Monica";"Nice to meet you! My"
"Joey";"Thanks for stopping by. See ya! (Throws them out and closes the door.) (ToCecilia) I-I am so sorry. I…"
"Cecilia";"Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I’m used to it, don’t worryabout it."
"Joey";"(notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!"
"Cecilia";"What?"
"Joey";"They sent me today’s script! They never send the script!"
"Cecilia";"They don’t?"
"Joey";"Well no, I’m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizeswhat that means.) Oh…"
"Cecilia";"How does it happen?"
"Joey";"(flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into anelectric fence."
"Cecilia";"Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!"
"Joey";"Yeah well, I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazyabout electricity either."
"Ross";"…now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt."
"Rachel";"(giggles) (To Ross) I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and kneesocks."
"Ross";"(To Rachel) Do you wanna start telling secrets?"
"Rachel";"No!"
"Ross";"(stands up) Now umm, remember I’m still learning."
"Ross";"One, two, three, four!"
"Ross";"You know the song! Sing along!"
"Ross";"So?"
"Monica and Chandler";"No!"
"Dina";"Loosening the saddle on mother’s horse was brilliant Fredrick. Andthe electric fence, inspired."
"Dina";"I can’t believe she’s really gone. Look around you, all of thisis ours. (They move into kiss but; they’re stopped by Joey entering with a hugebandage wrapped around his head.)"
"Joey";"(as Jessica) I don’t think so."
"Dina";"Who are you?!"
"Jessica Lockhart";"What’s the matter Dina? Don’t you recognize your own(Does a hair flip) mother?!"
"The Director";"Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!"
"Cecilia";"(running out to Joey) That was so wonderful! (Hugs him) Ohh, I thinkthat you’re a better Jessica than I ever was!"
"Joey";"Oh noo…"
"Cecilia";"Well of course not, but you were very good."
"Joey";"Thanks!"
"Cecilia";"And guess what? Good news! I got another job!"
"Joey";"Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!"
"Cecilia";"A film in Guadalajara!"
"Joey";"The airport?"
"Cecilia";"No that’s La Guardia. (Joey nods in recognition.) This is Mexico."
"Joey";"Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?"
"Cecilia";"Eight months."
"Joey";"That’s a really long time."
"Cecilia";"Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a fewplaces down there."
"Joey";"Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first.(Realizes.) And I just got what you meant again—That is—I tell ya, that is atricky one!"
"Cecilia";"That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You’ve,well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful."
"Joey";"Good luck."
"Cecilia";"You too."
"Ross";"You know the song! Sing along!"
"Phoebe";"Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!"
"that";"that"
"Ross";"Hi."
"Rachel";"Hi! Hi Ben!"
"Ben";"Hi."
"Ross";"Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency."
"Rachel";"Oh, yeah go ahead."
"Ross";"Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey’s special romance magazines inthere?"
"Rachel";"No. No."
"Ross";"(to Ben) Okay! All clear!"
"Ben";"(running to the bathroom) Thanks Phoebe!"
"Rachel";"Ben, its Rachel! (He closes the door.) But whatever."
"Ross";"(to Ben) Everything okay in there?"
"Ben";"Don’t talk to me now!"
"Rachel";"Awww, just like his daddy."
"Ross";"Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean’s office just calledand said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?"
"Rachel";"What-what about Monica?"
"Ross";"Oh, she isn’t home."
"Rachel";"(nervous) So it would just be, me alone?"
"Ross";"Well, Ben would be there."
"Rachel";"Huh umm…"
"Ross";"What’s the matter?"
"Rachel";"Well that—y’know it’s just uh, I’ve never done thatbefore. Me and him alone."
"Ross";"Rach, he’s not an ex-con."
"Rachel";"Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?"
"Ross";"I don’t know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Ross";"Okay. (Ben enters) Ben? Come here. All right, I’m gonna leave youhere with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?"
"Rachel";"Yeah I think so."
"Ross";"(To Rachel) I wasn’t talking to you."
"Ben";"I’ll be okay."
"Ross";"Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy. (He hugs and kisses him.) Be back inan hour."
"Ben";"Bye dad."
"Rachel";"Bye. (Ross exits.) Ahhh… (Silence) So this is fun, huh?"
"Ben";"Not really."
"Rachel";"Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?"
"Ben";"Okay."
"Rachel";"Uh great! How do you feel about"
"Ben";"I’m not allowed to have soda."
"Rachel";"Okay. Well that’s pretty much all that we have—Oh! Oh! Haveyou ever had a virgin margarita? (Holds up a bottle of margarita mix.)"
"Ben";"What’s a virgin?"
"Rachel";"Water it is."
"Monica";"What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him."
"Chandler";"You mean the spitter?"
"Monica";"Come on! It wasn’t that bad!"
"Chandler";"Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil."
"Monica";"All right, what about the third guy?"
"Chandler";"You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?"
"Monica";"Can you blame him?"
"Chandler";"Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say, "Ido," he’s thinking, "Yeah, I’d do her too!""
"Monica";"Well then we still have a problem."
"Chandler";"Yeah!"
"Phoebe";"(returning with Joey) With what?"
"Monica";"Well, we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding andthey’re all either boring or annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at theladies. (Points to her chest.)"
"Phoebe";"Oo! You should have one of us do it!"
"Monica";"Phoebe, we’re getting"
"Phoebe";"No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained onthe Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!"
"Monica";"Are you serious?"
"Phoebe";"Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal!"
"Joey";"I call it!!"
"Phoebe";"What?! No! It was my idea!"
"Chandler";"Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us."
"Joey";"Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!"
"Chandler";"We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I saylegitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!"
"Rachel";"Ben y’know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hangout all the time. ‘Cause I was, I was your daddy’s girlfriend."
"Ben";"But you’re not anymore!"
"Rachel";"No, I’m not."
"Ben";"‘Cause you guys were on a break."
"Rachel";"Hey! We were"
"Ben";"When’s my daddy coming back?"
"Rachel";"(checks her watch) Fifty-two minutes. (Pause) So no-no brothers andsisters, huh? That must be nice. You don’t have to share stuff."
"Ben";"Sharing is good."
"Rachel";"Oh, you’re one of"
"Ben";"Really? Like how?"
"Rachel";"Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh,we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt sothey’d put salt on their cereal."
"Ben";"(laughs) That’s a good one."
"Rachel";"Yeah? You like that one?"
"Ben";"Yeah, you’re funny."
"Rachel";"I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these!Umm, oh hear—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take aquarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you sayto person, I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin withoutit leaving your face. And then when they do it, they’re left with a big black pencilline right down the center of their face."
"Ben";"Can I do it to you?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I-I-I-I’m funny Ben, but I’m not stupid. Okay?"
"Joey";"So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?"
"Chandler";"No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we werestill together."
"Monica";"We’re never gonna find anybody."
"Joey";"Well then let me do it!"
"Chandler";"Joe…"
"Joey";"No-no-no! Look, I’ve been thinking about it. I’m an actor right?So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people."
"Monica";"Joey look it’s really sweet…"
"Joey";"No-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit, and I won’t stare atMonica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone knows I’m an ass man!"
"Monica";"That is true."
"Joey";"Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like,stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do areally good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot tome."
"Chandler";"(To Monica) Y’know, we haven’t found anybody else."
"Monica";"It might be kinda cool."
"Joey";"So I can do it?"
"Chandler";"Yeah you can do it."
"Joey";"All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on myspeech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?"
"Chandler";"Yeah."
"Joey";"Okay."
"Monica";"Hey Pheebs, how’s it going?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!"
"Monica";"Oh, I’m sorry. Can I get you something?"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God, you’ve"
"Monica";"Here, take a couple of these. (She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)"
"Phoebe";"What is it?"
"Monica";"It’s Hexadrin."
"Phoebe";"Oh no, I don’t believe in Western medicine. No, if you just applypressure to these points right here. (She’s pinching the bit of skin between herright thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and youstill have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)"
"Monica";"Okay, while we’re waiting for these pills to kick in, I’mgonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. (Phoebe gets up and goes with her.) Get somenice soft pillows under your head, I’m gonna turn the TV on and you can watchwhatever you want. And I’m—Sit down—(She sits down on the couch)—gonnamake you some tea.

"Rachel";"Coming."
"Ross";"I have a bone to pick with you."
"Rachel";"Uh-oh."
"Ross";"Yes! Ben learned a little trick."
"Rachel";"Oh yeah? Did he pull the old… (She is waving her hand up and downher face. She’s thinking about the pencil mark.)"
"Ross";"That’s right! That’s right!"
"Rachel";"Oh that."
"Ross";"Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean andthey’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!"
"Rachel";"Oh, come on!"
"Ross";"I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taughthim right?"
"Rachel";"(looking at his mark) Yes."
"Phoebe";"It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pillscalled?"
"Monica";"Hexadrin. (She gets the box out of her purse.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with astory! (She pulls out the instructions and side affects paper.)"
"Monica";"No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff."
"Phoebe";"Say what?"

"It is a love based on giving and receiving.As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared andreceived. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." (Phoebe nodsher approval.) "We too can share and love and have and receive.""

"Carol";"(from the kitchen) Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?"
"Rachel";"Yes oh—(To Ben)—Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.)No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay, do you remember all thatstuff I taught you yesterday?"
"Ben";"(mimicking her) Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?"

"Chandler";"Yeah. O-okay."
"Joey";"(reading) "When I think of the love that these two givers andreceivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving andgiving and…" And then I can’t think of a good word for right here. (Hepoints to the stop on the paper where he left off.)"
"Monica";"How about receiving?"
"Joey";"Yes!"
"Chandler";"See Joe, not that that’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool thingsabout having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us!Y’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!"
"Joey";"Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh sohard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?"
"Chandler";"No, not us… (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)"
"Monica";"I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a wholeanything?"
"Phoebe";"Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from theeyes?"
"Monica";"It doesn’t say that!"
"Phoebe";"Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!"
"Chandler";"See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romanticstories. Nice stories."
"Joey";"Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’knowwhen you two hooked up! Only, only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, "Begantheir beautiful journey…""
"Monica";"There you go!"

"Chandler";"Joe?"
"Joey";"Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meetacross the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub togetherand she’s feeding you strawberries?"

"Joey";"Yeah!! I call that London style."
"Monica";"No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sadthat night because this guy that I was Ross’s mom."
"Joey";"Oh."
"Monica";"And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well wedrank too much…"
"Joey";"Yeah baby!"
"Chandler";"And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room andsaid goodnight."
"Joey";"Oh."
"Chandler";"But then later that night…"
"Joey";"Yeah baby!"
"Chandler";"(answering the door) Hey!"
"Monica";"(standing outside) Cute PJ’s! You’re really livin’ it uphere in London huh?"
"Chandler";"Well I was… I was exactly expecting company after…(He looksat his watch.) 9:15."
"Monica";"(entering) Is Joey here?"
"Chandler";"Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with thebride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you’re not still upset aboutwhat that guy told ya are ya?"
"Monica";"Wouldn’t you be?"
"Chandler";"Well, look it’s been a really emotional time y’know, andyou’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that"
"Monica";"Really?"
"Chandler";"You kidding? You’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms…(She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s goingon? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?"
"Monica";"Well, not anymore."
"Chandler";"But we don’t do that."
"Monica";"I know, I just thought it would be fun."
"Chandler";"How drunk are you?"
"Monica";"Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that youshould feel guilty about taking advantage."
"Chandler";"(thinks) That’s the perfect amount!"
"Monica";"Okay!"
"Monica";"(breaking the kiss) Y’know what’s weird?"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Monica";"This doesn’t feel weird!"
"Chandler";"I know."
"Monica";"You’re a really good kisser."
"Chandler";"Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wannaget under the covers?"
"Monica";"Hm-hmm!"
"Chandler";"Okay!"

"Chandler";"Count of three?"
"Monica";"One!"
"Chandler";"Two!"
"Monica";"Two!"
"Monica and Chandler";"Three! (They lift up the covers and check each otherout, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)"
"Chandler";"Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectivelyruined."
"Monica";"Eh, we weren’t that close anyway!"
"Chandler";"Eh!"
"Chandler";"Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the coversas Joey enters. Remember?)"
"Joey";"Hey!"

"Chandler";"Uh, could you leave me one?"
"Joey";"(pause) For just you?"
"Chandler";"Yeah."

"Chandler";"No I-I-I’m fine."
"Joey";"All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)"
"Joey";"That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought youwere on to something, but it did nothing for me."
"Monica";"Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s"
"Joey";"Oh… (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that lastone? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sentthat hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars!"

"Monica";"What?!"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Phoebe";"(To Joey) What?!"
"Chandler";"Who did you originally want to hook up with?"
"Monica";"Okay, fine but"
"Joey";"Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!"

"Monica";"No because it-it didn’t seem important."
"Chandler";"Oh, it’s not important? It’s not important?! If itwasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!"
"Monica";"Noo!! The point is that is was"
"Joey";"And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv—(Shutsup on Monica’s glare.)"

"Carol";"Oh I…I think they’re funny."
"Ross";"You have a line down your face."
"Carol";"What? (Goes and checks.)"

It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guysare perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and itjust…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever."
"Chandler";"That’s what you should say."

"Chandler";"When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say."
"Joey";"Really? I can do it?"
"Chandler";"I’d love it if you would do it."
"Joey";"Hey! (They hug.)"

"Ross";"What? (She takes the sign off and hands it to him.) That’s great.That is great. (Crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.) What did we justfinish talking about Ben?!"
"Rachel";"Oh I…"
"Ben";"What did we just finish talking about Ben?!"

"Joey";"Food? Uh-huh gimme! (She hands him the paper.)"

"Monica";"I will."
"Chandler";"Do you want me to call?"
"Monica";"No, I’ll do it. You just stick to your job."
"Phoebe";"What is your job?"
"Chandler";"Staying out of the way."

"Monica";"There were only twelve."
"Joey";"Oh yeah, I added three."
"Monica";"What are peanut butter fingers?!"

"Chandler";"Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged.I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore."
"The Woman";"Could you guys help me? (Chandler shyly exhales and looks away.)"
"Ross";"Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you."

"The Woman";"I-I am Kristen."
"Ross";"Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, ‘cause if youare…I’d love to show you around sometime."
"Kristen";"I…I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over."
"Ross";"Ah."
"Kristen";"But-but this block is like a whole other world."
"Ross";"Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, thisstreet is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristencrinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down thestreet. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what he’s talkingabout.)"
"Chandler";"(To Ross) Smooth."
"Kristen";"(To Chandler) Excuse me? (Chandler does the shy thing again.)"
"Ross";"Umm, say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do yousay I take you to dinner tonight?"

"Ross";"So let’s decide on the spending limit…"

"Chandler";"I don’t want to say."
"Rachel";"Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid."
"Chandler";"Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them itwas…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all mydances with."

"Kristen";"Do you two know each other?"
"Joey and Ross";"No. No."
"Joey";"No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a womanon the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge."
"Ross";"Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?"
"Joey";"Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!"
"Ross";"Hey you leave Marcel out of this!"

"Lewis";"What kinda noise?"
"Ross";"Just a high pitched intimidating noise."
"Lewis";"But like how?"
"Ross";"Well we-we don’t know for sure. But in my head it-it soundedsomething like this. (He makes a high pitched noise and Alan doesn’t know what tomake of it.) Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that’s uh, that’s all fortoday. (Everyone starts to get up.) Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?"

"Ross";"Well I’m sorry but, that-that’s really not my problem."
"Morse";"I’m in love with you."
"Ross";"Well that brings me in the loop a little."
"Morse";"You see, that’s why I did so bad on this test. I’m having ahard time concentrating. When you’re up there (Points to the podium) and you’reteaching and your face gets all serious…you look so good. (In a sexy voice) You wearthat tight little turtleneck sweater…"
"Ross";"Okay! (Walks away from him.) Umm, I uh, I’m your teacher. I’msorry, you’re-you’re a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may bewritten on the backs of some of these chairs."

"Monica";"Really? (Looks.) My God, he’s really cute."
"Phoebe";"Go for it."
"Monica";"Phoebe, I’m engaged!"
"Phoebe";"I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is inan accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover tosatisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill."
"The Cute Guy";"(To Monica) Hi!"
"Monica";"Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’mengaged. (Points to her ring.)"

"Rachel";"Well of course I do! But y’know, favorite returning character is atough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation."
"Joey";"Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it’s just…I’venever even been nominated before! I want it so much."
"Rachel";"Well Joey, you’ll probably get it. But you should probablyyour-your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wannalook disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’ssorta like… (Does it, you’ll have to see it.)"

"Monica";"Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly."
"Phoebe";"(laughs) All I could think of was y’know, "Is he gonna kissme? Is he gonna kiss me?""
"Monica";"And did he?"
"Phoebe";"I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickeyspeaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)"
"Monica";"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it."
"Phoebe";"I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinkstoday and I’ve only had six."
"Monica";"Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out withChandler. Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again am I?"
"Phoebe";"You sound like a guy."
"Monica";"No, a guy would be saying, "I’m never gonna get to sleep withanyone else." Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things thatI’d be giving up! I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again."
"Phoebe";"You’ll have a last kiss."

"Rachel";"Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once andit was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every timehe looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and inlove."
"Ross";"Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack."

"Rachel";"I didn’t. I got under him."
"Joey";"(To Ross) Problem solved."

"Phoebe";"Okay bye. (They kiss.)"
"Jake";"All right. Bye. (Backs out the door.)"
"Phoebe";"Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-byeat the door so as not to flaunt our new love."

"Monica";"Okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you thatyou’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?"
"Chandler";"Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I’m afraid evenmore sweating."
"Monica";"Even with me?"
"Chandler";"I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of ourrelationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna betogether for the rest of our lives."
"Monica";"Really?"
"Chandler";"Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts,I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sportsdrink."
"Monica";"Come here! Come here! (They hug.) Sweetie you don’t have to worry.No, besides y’know what? I’m gonna have a lot of new things with you. The firsttime we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid…"

"Ross";"A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every womanin America."
"Monica";"Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?"
"Phoebe";"Sure."
"Monica";"I gotta make up the guest bedroom. (To Ross) Hey, Cousin Cassie iscoming to stay with us a few days."

"Monica";"Okay. Sorry. (She goes into the guest bedroom.)"
"Rachel";"(To Phoebe) Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!"
"Monica";"Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?"
"Joey";"I don’t know! It’s not like it’s porn! This is a serious,legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story."
"Monica";"That’s what you say about porn."
"Joey";"You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back."
"Monica";"No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean thechance to star in a movie? Come on!"
"Joey";"Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it soundsreally great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Whorun away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn andundress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender."
"Monica";"Plus, everyone’s gonna see your thing. (Giggles.)"
"Phoebe";"Well when can we have this shower?"
"Rachel";"She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We haveFriday…"
"Phoebe";"Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?"
"Rachel";"Yesterday!"
"Phoebe";"Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We’re done!"
"Rachel";"Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday!We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s justtoo much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot doit!"
"Phoebe";"Rachel, calm down!"
"Rachel";"(calmly) Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right, you’re right."
"Phoebe";"(grabs and shakes Rachel) Just calm down woman!"
"Rachel";"Phoebe, I already, I already did."
"Phoebe";"Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little."
"Rachel";"Okay. Okay. (They sit down.) I think we can do this if we just getorganized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fastdecisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?"
"Phoebe";"Uh, here. What time?"
"Rachel";"4 o’clock. Food?"
"Phoebe";"Finger sandwiches and tea."
"Rachel";"Ooh great! Very Monica."
"Phoebe";"And chili!"
"Rachel";"Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?"
"Phoebe";"Both!"
"Rachel";"We’re paying for this y’know."
"Phoebe";"Neither."
"Rachel";"Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?"
"Phoebe";"Lusts of the flesh."
"Rachel";"(pause) What?"
"Phoebe";"I don’t know. (Timidly) A cowboy theme?"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleeptogether before the wedding."
"Monica";"Oh boy me too!"
"Chandler";"Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh webroke up for a few hours…"
"Monica";"Yeah?"
"Chandler";"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy anddomineering?!"
"Monica";"The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!"
"Chandler";"That’s me! Come on!"
"Monica";"Okay. (They both jump up to head for there room, but Monica stops.) Butwait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to havelunch."
"Chandler";"Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill."
"Monica";"Shrill?! The wedding is back on!"
"Cassie";"I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler."
"Chandler";"(transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!"
"Cassie";"Nice to meet you too."
"Monica";"So, are you ready to go?"
"Cassie";"Yeah."
"Monica";"(catching him) Chandler!"
"Chandler";"I’ll be right with you."
"Monica";"(To Ross) Cassie needs to stay at your place."
"Ross";"What—why?"
"Monica";"Because Purvry Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her."
"Ross";"What?! Chandler she’s our cousin!"
"Chandler";"I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently.It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monica’s eyes.)Say something."
"Monica";"You were staring about eight inches south of there."
"Ross";"Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie evenlook like now."
"Monica";"She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn."
"Chandler";"Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?"
"Monica";"Wafer thin ice!"
"Joey";"Hey, I’m back!"
"The Casting Director";"Hi-hi Joey."
"Joey";"Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?"
"The Casting Director";"Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn’t need tocome down here today."
"Joey";"Oh great! Y’know I would’ve been perfect for this part, butwhatever! Y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!(Starts to leave.)"
"The Casting Director";"Wait Joey! You didn’t need to come down because thedirector saw your tape from yesterday and loved it."
"Joey";"And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah!Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?"
"The Casting Director";"Well, the director thinks you’re really right for thepart and wants to meet you tomorrow."
"Joey";"Wow! Sure! That’s great!"
"The Casting Director";"Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity."
"Joey";"Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it’s handled tastefully and that barnis not too cold."
"The Casting Director";"Terrific! Well uh, there’s one more thing. Uhh, uhit’s really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic.Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she’s never seen anaked man who wasn’t Jewish. So… (Laughs.)"
"Joey";"So…What?"
"The Casting Director";"So uh well the director is insisting that whoever playthat part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I’m saying?"
"Joey";"Yes!"
"The Casting Director";"Okay."
"Joey";"No. What?"
"The Casting Director";"An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would notbe…"
"Joey";"Barmifsaed?"
"Monica";"So to get this part you can’t be?"
"Joey";"Nope."
"Monica";"But you are?"
"Joey";"Yep."
"Monica";"But you told them you weren’t?"
"Joey";"That’s right."
"Monica";"Wow! Wow! And it’s definitely all gone? There’s nothing thereto work with? (Joey glares at her.) What were you thinking?"
"Joey";"I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matterwhat you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse,you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later."
"Monica";"Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learningto…grow a turtleneck!"
"Joey";"I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meetthe director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like."
"Monica";"Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!"
"Joey";"I just have to call my agent and tell her I can’t do the part. (Getsup for the phone.)"
"Monica";"Unless!"
"Joey";"Unless what?"
"Monica";"Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion."
"Joey";"Like what?"
"Monica";"Well I’m not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I’mthinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat."
"Phoebe";"Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay,we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside iseveryone’s individual birth stone."
"Rachel";"Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the partyis tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list."
"Phoebe";"Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?"
"Monica";"(entering) Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey! What’s up Mon?"
"Monica";"Well uh, I’m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if Iraid your fridge?"
"Rachel";"Have at it."
"Monica";"Okay. (Opens the fridge.) All right, turkey. Eh, that won’t work.Cheese? (Picks it up) That won’t work. Olive loaf? (Picks it up) I hope thatwon’t work."
"Rachel";"Are you makin’ him a sandwich?"
"Monica";"No it’s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I’m gonna go guys."
"Phoebe and Rachel";"Okay."
"Monica";"I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!(Runs out.)"
"Rachel";"(To Phoebe, after Monica’s gone) We have to get her a present?!"
"Phoebe";"Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book! (Holds itup.) We have a guest list!"
"Rachel";"Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?"
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)"
"Ross";"(shocked at her beauty) Cassie?!"
"Cassie";"Hey Ross!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Cassie";"(hugs him) It’s been so long! Last time I saw you, you were settingup your tent in line to see"
"Ross";"Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemedlike you didn’t."
"Cassie";"Ah yeah, sorry about that."
"Ross";"It’s okay. Come, come on in."
"Cassie";"Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica’s place was nice,but her fiancee sure stares a lot."
"Ross";"Oh."
"Cassie";"Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!"
"Ross";"Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions."
"Cassie";"Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me."
"Ross";"Yeah—No!!"
"Ross";"Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog."
"Cassie";"I’m all done."
"Ross";"(quietly) Thank God."
"Cassie";"I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rentedthat beach house together."
"Ross";"Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down andtickled you ‘til you cried? (She laughs) We’re probably too old to do that now."
"Cassie";"I’ll always remember that summer, because it’s when I got allof these freckles. (She pulls her blouse open to show him her shoulder and bra strap.)"
"Ross";"(looking then moving away quickly) Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’llalways remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related."
"Cassie";"It took you that long to figure it out, huh?"
"Ross";"Well I’m, I’m a little slow. (To himself) Just as our childrenwould be."
"Phoebe";"Hi!"
"Woman";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple ofwomen.) Hi, thanks for coming."
"Woman";"Oh thank you."
"Phoebe";"Thank you. (To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes toanother pairing.) Oh, it’s so nice to see you."
"Woman";"No."
"The Other Woman";"No thanks."
"Phoebe";"Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?"
"Rachel";"Yeah?"
"Phoebe";"Who the hell are all these people?"
"Rachel";"Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phonebook and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice."
"Phoebe";"Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!"
"Rachel";"(to her) Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid ofhonor. How do you know Monica?"
"Woman";"I was her accountant four years ago."
"Rachel";"Ohhhh!"
"Woman";"I’m very interested to find out who’s been doing her taxesthese last four years."
"Rachel";"That’s great!"
"Woman";"So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?"
"Phoebe and Rachel";"(to each other) I don’t know."
"Rachel";"(to the woman) Excuse us for a minute. (They go into the kitchen.) Youdidn’t tell her to come?!"
"Phoebe";"You were supposed to tell her!"
"Rachel";"No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come and I wassupposed to bring the cake!"
"Phoebe";"Fine, I’ll go call her."
"Rachel";"Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!"
"Monica";"Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you totry on."
"Joey";"Wow! This looks great!"
"Monica";"Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. (Points to it.) Umm, this one ismade of bologna. (Points.)"
"Joey";"And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?"
"Monica";"Oh, just until the glue dries."
"Joey";"Thank God!"
"Monica";"(to a whole group) Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable."
"Joey";"Ah."
"Monica";"Okay? (To a different group) Over here we have pink suede, which isnice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it’s gonna shrink."
"Joey";"Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.)"
"Monica";"I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that’s really justfor me. (Rubs it against her cheek.) Okay. So, why don’t you go into your room andtry these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work."
"Joey";"Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird."
"Joey";"Ow!"
"Monica";"Toothpick?"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Monica";"What are you trying on now?"
"Joey";"The fruit roll up."

"Rachel";"Oh Monica, we are so sorry."
"Monica";"For what?"
"Rachel";"Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower."
"Phoebe";"And then for forgetting to invite you to it."
"Monica";"You al-you already had it?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of peoplecame, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave."
"Rachel";"Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and nowyou don’t have either."
"Phoebe";"We ruined everything."
"Rachel";"Ugh…"
"Monica";"Well no wait a minute that’s not true! No, what did, that wasreally sweet. And it kinda works out for the best."
"Rachel";"What do you, what do you mean?"
"Monica";"Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! Imean, I get all those presents (Motions to the pile in the corner) without having to talkto people I don’t even like!"
"Rachel";"Surprise…"
"Phoebe";"Sur-surprise."
"Rachel";"…Monica."

"The Casting Director";"Joey, this is awkward part."
"Joey";"Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. (He starts taking off his clothes.) Itotally understand. You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scarsor tattoos. Don’t you worry; I have nothing to hide. (He drops his pants and standsback up and looks down.) So there you go, that’s me. (We cut to a camera anglelooking at the casting director and movie director through Joey’s legs.) One hundredpercent natural! (Suddenly, there’s a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone isshocked.) I tell ya, that has never happened before."
"Phoebe";"Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?"
"Cassie";"Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here."
"Phoebe";"Oh! No problem!

"Chandler";"Well this is just sad!"
"Monica";"All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do somerearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!"
"Rachel";"That is not a problem."
"Joey";"(leaning down to her) Maybe you’ll order a little sangria?"
"Rachel";"Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)"
"Rachel";"(motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make andif there’s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs afew) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved."

"Rachel";"Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau andMelissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!"
"Phoebe";"(To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on thecheek."
"Joey";"Why are you taking this away from me?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!"
"Phoebe";"Okay! I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian. (Joeysmiles and nods lewdly.)"
"Rachel";"I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying thatthis happened!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’knowso…vanilla."
"Rachel";"(shocked) Vanilla?!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean Igot-I got drunk and married in Vegas!"
"Phoebe";"To Ross."
"Rachel";"All right, y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me aboutthis, why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you."
"Phoebe";"Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it."
"Joey";"Oh-ho, you should get inside my head."
"Ross";"Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)"
"Chandler";"A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?"
"Ross";"No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’stux!"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Ross";"That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in thehit film…that Batman film he was in."
"Chandler";"You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! JamesBond’s tux!"
"Ross";"So?"
"Chandler";"So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special."
"Ross";"Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you havethe most special thing of all!"
"Chandler";"Please, don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!"
"Ross";"Pretty please? Not very uh, 007."
"Chandler";"Look, it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married Iwould never do anything to upset you."
"Ross";"When I got married you slept with my sister."
"Joey";"Hey."
"Monica";"Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right, I figured it out.I’m gonna take two tables of eight, I’m gonna add your parents, and I’mgonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added twoextra meals, we are good to go!"
"Joey";"Yeah, they’re not coming."
"Monica";"(looking at him) What?!"
"Joey";"Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.They…feel a little unwanted."
"Monica";"Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad."
"Joey";"Look Mon, if you could just call my mom…"
"Monica";"Oh Joey!"
"Joey";"Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want themto be there. Let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas overthe years."
"Monica";"No she hasn’t."
"Joey";"Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?"
"Monica";"Well, what am I going to say?"
"Joey";"I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with theinvitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They"
"Monica";"(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, thisis Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah I’m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh,really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations thatwe sent weren’t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn postoffice! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, theUS Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What are they Irish?! (Joey givesher a thumbs up.)"
"Melissa";"…anyway, his name is Allan and we’ve been going out for threeyears. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party forhis girlfriend at the time. Oh well. (Rachel and Phoebe politely laugh) And he was ThetaBeta Pi at Syracuse."
"Rachel";"Oh. Oh, that’s great!"
"Melissa";"Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?"
"Phoebe";"Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon."
"Melissa";"What one?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah! Y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut usdown when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning."
"Melissa";"Oh, isn’t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?(Phoebe agrees by grunting.)"
"Rachel";"(changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh,tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and Iuh, we made out."
"Melissa";"(shocked) What?"
"Rachel";"Remember?! We—come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-thecoconut bikini tops…"
"Melissa";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"…we went back the house and we got really silly and we…we madeout."
"Melissa";"Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you’re talking about."
"Phoebe";"Really?!"
"Chandler";"Ross is Batman!"
"Monica";"Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time."
"Chandler";"Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batmanis so much cooler than James Bond!"
"Monica";"What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!"
"Chandler";"Batman has a utility belt!"
"Monica";"007 has a fancy car!"
"Chandler";"Batman has the Batmobile!"
"Monica";"007 gets all the ladies."
"Chandler";"Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get"
"Monica";"How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I’ll make you a nicemartini."
"Chandler";"Actually, I don’t like martinis."
"Monica";"How about a"
"Chandler";"Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey."
"Monica";"Hey."
"Joey";"Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you wantpeople to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?"
"Monica";"The show?!"
"Joey";"Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it’s gonna start alittle late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?"
"Monica";"Have you ever been to one of"
"Joey";"Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it’s the same day as myniece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me.‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of theshow—Wedding!"
"Monica";"The wedding starts at six."
"Joey";"Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little‘til they get there?"
"Monica";"You’ll vamp?!"
"Joey";"Yeah! Yeah y’know, like warm up the crowd. Ask ‘em wherethey’re from. ‘Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister"
"Rachel";"How can you not remember us kissing?!"
"Melissa";"I don’t know. I don’t remember a lot of things that neverhappened."
"Rachel";"Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! Wecouldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, somewhere Joey’s head is exploding."
"Rachel";"Yeah—but come on—Listen, I’m sorry I don’t want tomake you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believeme."
"Melissa";"I’m sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it.Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping."
"Rachel";"No!!"
"Phoebe";"Rachel, it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you.All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa."
"Rachel";"Thank you Phoebe."
"Melissa";"She didn’t."
"Phoebe";"I know."
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Monica";"You just carry that around?"
"Ross";"Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece."
"Monica";"Between you and…"
"Ross";"Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’knowget a picture of Batman and James Bond together."
"Chandler";"I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight."
"Monica";"A little tight? I could see double-oh"
"Ross";"Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxestogether."
"Chandler";"Well, does that mean that you’re not going to wearing yours?"
"Ross";"What are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!!"
"Chandler";"(standing up) Let me try it on!"
"Ross";"Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ inthere."
"Chandler";"(trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Findssomething in the pocket) What’s this?"
"Ross";"What?"
"Chandler";"An invitation for the"
"Ross";"Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!"
"Chandler";"The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.(Hands him the jacket and walks away.)"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?"
"Monica";"All right that’s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it!You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter andscream racial slurs? I don’t care!"
"Joey";"No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents,that was really sweet. They’re so happy they get to be a part of your special day."
"Monica";"(defeated) Oh."
"Chandler";"Well, you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really gladthey’re coming."
"Joey";"Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!(Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like thiswhen I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for partytime."
"Rachel";"It happened! I am telling you it happened!"
"Melissa";"Okay. (To Phoebe) Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-Idon’t think I’ll be calling you (hails a cab) because umm, y’knowyou’ve gotten weird. (The cab pulls up.) Take care you guys."
"Rachel";"What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look,"
"Melissa";"My God! You love me!"
"Rachel";"(shocked) What?"
"Melissa";"Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I canstill hear the coconuts knockin’ together I… (Phoebe is shocked.) I justdidn’t want to tell you ‘cause I didn’t think that you’d return mylove, and now that you have… (Leans in to kiss Rachel.)"
"Rachel";"(moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!"
"Melissa";"Aww, look who’s being suddenly shy. You can’t tell me youdon’t feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. (Goes in again.)"
"Rachel";"(moves away again) I-I-I-I’m just…I’m just a good kisser!"
"Melissa";"(suddenly frightened) Shut up!"
"Rachel";"I’m sorry!"
"Melissa";"(laughs) Oh you don’t have to be (Laughs again) sorry.I’m…I’m obviously kidding. I’m not in love with you. (To Phoebe)I’m not in love with her. I don’t hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, Idon’t…picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go.Eh…kiss good-bye? (Rachel stares at her stunned.) No? Okay. (Hurries into the cab anddrives off.)"
"Rachel";"Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna…"
"Rachel";"What the hell was that?!"
"Phoebe";"I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about."
"Rachel";"And?"
"Phoebe";"I’ve had better."
"Chandler";"(yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!"
"Rachel";"Well y’know what they say, the 23"
"Chandler";"Whose is it?"
"Rachel";"Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome."
"Chandler";"Whose is it?"
"Rachel";"I don’t want to say."
"Chandler";"Oh, come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it?"
"Rachel";"Diane Keeton."
"Monica";"Do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married?Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!"
"Chandler";"Do you realize you get louder each week?"
"Monica";"There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?"
"Chandler";"I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow.(Laughs)"
"Monica";"Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding."
"Chandler";"Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?"
"Monica";"No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say."
"Chandler";"Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?"
"Monica";"(handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Let’s just do it right now.Okay? It won’t be hard. Just say what’s in your heart. (She goes back, sitsdown, and starts feverishly writing.)"
"Chandler";"(watching in her) (in his head)"
"Chandler";"(writing) Monica, there are no words… (To Joey and Ross) Thereare no words! This should not be this hard!"
"Joey";"All right, uh… (To Ross) Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross,well what did you say when you made up your vows?"
"Ross";"Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day Idie. She made no such promise."
"Chandler";"I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! Youshould’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!"
"Rachel";"Monica what?"
"Phoebe";"What?!"
"Rachel";"What is the emergency?!"
"Monica";"You have to help me! I’m supposed to be writing my vows and all Ihave is this! (Shows them what she’s been working on.)"
"Rachel";"Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress."
"Monica";"Thank you."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)"
"Monica";"Those are my eyes!"
"Phoebe";"Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)"
"Ross";"Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm,Monica from the moment I met you, I"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that."
"Ross";"...everyone, this is Chandler!"
"Fat Monica";"Hi, I'm Ross's little sister."
"Chandler";"(seeing her) Okay."
"Rachel";"Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, eventhough we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.""
"Chandler";"All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man onEarth. Would you go out with me?"
"Monica";"Ennnh."
"Monica";"Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!"
"Phoebe";"Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe youjust say something about y’know all the things that he’s taught you. Like…(They all try to think about one example and don’t succeed.) Or all the things youtaught him."
"Monica";"Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labellingthem) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there’s more thanthree), five, six, and seven!"
"Chandler";"(shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) That’s one?"
"Monica";"It’s kind of an important one!"
"Chandler";"Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down."
"Rachel";"Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what thatcould’ve meant.)"
"Monica";"All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,6-7, 7 …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…(mouths 7)! (They both lean backon the couch satisfied.)"
"Joey";"Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica…"
"Chandler";"(writing) Monica…"
"Joey";""…when I look back over our time together…""
"Chandler";"(writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?"
"Joey";"Well, I can’t do everything! Look back over your time together."
"Phoebe";"Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute."
"Monica";"No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?"
"Chandler";"You'll get one."
"Monica";"Oh yeah? When?"
"Chandler";"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us aremarried, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
"Monica";"Why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
"Chandler";"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
"Monica";"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
"Chandler";"No, no, no."
"Monica";"What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?"
"Chandler";"(trapped) Uh, uh."
"Monica";"Well?"
"Chandler";"Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the backof the chair he was sitting in)"
"Ross";"(Screaming) I’m getting marriedtoday!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.)"
"Monica";"(Comes up for below the covers andlooks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica notknowing what to say.)"
"Chandler";"Nice try."
"Monica";"Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)"
"Chandler";"Look, Monica…"
"Monica";"Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)"
"Chandler";"This is not going to work."
"Monica";"I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)"
"Chandler";"You are so great! I love you!"
"Monica";"What?"
"Chandler";"Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, Ijust stopped talking!"
"Monica";"You said you loved me! I can't believe this!"
"Chandler";"No I didn't!"
"Monica";"Yes, you did!"
"Chandler";"No I didn't!"
"Monica";"You love me!"
"Chandler";"No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!"
"Chandler";"Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?"
"Monica";"Then all your stuff would be here."
"Chandler";"Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
"Monica";"Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean itdoesn’t make any sense."
"Chandler";"Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’msaying?"
"Monica";"You wanted it to be a surprise."
"Chandler";"Oh my God."
"Monica";"Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.(Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s areason why girls don’t do this!"
"Chandler";"Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God,I thought… (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) Ithought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thingthat matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.(Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my lifetrying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will youmarry me?"
"Monica";"Yes."
"Joey";"(yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!"
"Monica";"Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.)We’re engaged!!!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey, what have you guys been up to?"
"Ross";"Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out becauseJoey kept making inappropriate suggestions."
"Joey";"How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?"
"Ross";"How’s Monica coming along with her vows?"
"Phoebe";"Well let’s just say its she’s lucky she has a sweet ass,‘cause she’s not so good at the writing."
"Ross";"I can’t believe in four weeks they’re gonna be married!"
"Phoebe";"Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know nine out of tenmarriages end in divorce?"
"Ross";"Phoebe that’s not true."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, you’re right. How’s the Mrs.?"
"Rachel";"I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years."
"Joey";"(shocked) Has it been that long?!"
"Ross";"Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long."
"Joey";"Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!"
"Chandler";"I've had a very long, hard day."
"Joey";"Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?"
"Chandler";"Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then."
"Joey";"Okay."
"Chandler";"Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me aboutchicken."
"Monica";"Chicken? I could eat some chicken."
"Chandler";"Hey Joe!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a"
"Rachel";"I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us."
"Joey";"I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it."
"Joey";"(To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!"
"Monica";"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!"
"Joey";"How?! When?!"
"Chandler";"It happened in London."
"Chandler";"The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make abig deal out of it."
"Joey";"But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!"
"Chandler";"No-no-no-no-no! You can't!"
"Monica";"Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?Just promise you won't tell."
"Joey";"All right! Man, this is unbelievable!"
"Monica";"(on phone) I can't wait to be with you!  I'll just tell Rachel I'mgonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours."
"Chandler";"(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel isabsolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)"
"Monica";"(on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…"
"Rachel";"Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace aroundwondering what to do.)"
"Phoebe";"(looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Startsyelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothesoff.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!"
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"(screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!"
"Rachel";"Oh my God!"
"Rachel";"OH MY GOD!!!"
"Rachel";"Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!"
"Rachel";"I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!"
"Phoebe";"YOU KNOW?!!!"
"Rachel";"Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stopscreaming!!"
"Ross";"(entering) What's going on?"
"Phoebe and Rachel";"Ohhh!!!"
"Rachel";"(trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)HI!! Hi!"
"Ross";"What?! What?!"
"Rachel";"Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get thisapartment!"
"Ross";"Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebestarts jumping to divert his attention.)"
"Phoebe";"(Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her andRachel.)"
"Phoebe";"Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachelknows?"
"Joey";"Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of usknow that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets wouldfinally be over!"
"Phoebe";"Or, we could"
"Rachel";"All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie."
"Monica";"Bye!"
"All";"Bye!"
"Phoebe";"Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (Shepinches his butt.)"
"Chandler";"(after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriateand the pinching!!"
"Monica";"Actually, I did!"
"Chandler";"Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
"Monica";"Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!"
"Chandler";"Phoebe knows about us!"
"Joey";"Well"
"Monica";"Them?! Who's them?"
"Joey";"Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey."
"Monica";"Joey!"
"Joey";"And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!"
"Monica";"Oh man, they think they are so"
"Chandler";"Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!"
"Phoebe";"I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!"
"Rachel";"Are you kidding?!"
"Phoebe";"No!"
"Rachel";"I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenlyand slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that weknow?"
"Joey";"No."
"Rachel";"Joey!"
"Joey";"They know you know."
"Rachel";"Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!"
"Phoebe";"God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess withus?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,you can't say anything!"
"Joey";"I couldn't even if I wanted too."
"Chandler";"Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to putlotion on her!"
"Monica";"She's bluffing!"
"Chandler";"Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a littlemimic of her dance.)"
"Phoebe";"He's not backing down. He went to get lotion."
"Joey";"(entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!"
"Rachel";"Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandlerthe sooner this is all over and out in the open."
"Joey";"Ooh!"
"Rachel";"Okay!"
"Joey";"I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)"
"Phoebe";"Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons."
"Joey";"It's not my first time."
"Monica";"You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!"
"Chandler";"Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?"
"Monica";"Of course."
"Chandler";"Oh, you're-you're going?"
"Phoebe";"Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and isshowcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra."
"Chandler";"(swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm veryhappy were gonna have all the sex."
"Phoebe";"You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now."
"Chandler";"Not if I kiss you first."
"Phoebe";"Ooh."
"Chandler";"Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."
"Phoebe";"Here it comes. Our first kiss."
"Chandler";"Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!"
"Phoebe";"And why not?!"
"Chandler";"Because I'm in love with Monica!!"
"Phoebe";"You're-you're what?!"
"Chandler";"Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (Theywalk together and hug.) I love you, Monica."
"Monica";"I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)"

"Joey";"So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!"
"Monica";"Well actually, Ross doesn't."
"Chandler";"Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
"Ross";"(He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh… What are youdoing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.)"
"Phoebe";"Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gottachange things."
"Rachel";"You really think it would be that different?"
"Phoebe";"How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be havingkids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a"
"Rachel";"Well, things change."
"Joey";"I don’t want them to move to a"
"Ross";"It’ll be okay Joe."
"Joey";"I’m sorry, I just…I like things the way they are."
"Rachel";"Hey, who's this little naked guy?"

"Joey";"If he goes first he can!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys?Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin."
"Rachel";"Wait a minute! (To Monica) You let"

"Ross";"It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!"
"Monica";"Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights afteryou’re done."
"Joey";"(entering) Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"

"Monica";"Nice work everybody! So much for the y’know, "You can driveit, but don’t tell Rachel" plan!"
"Rachel";"Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me."
"Phoebe";"Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk aboutis the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)"
"Monica";"Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won’t let you drive thePorsche is because you’re a terrible driver. There! That wasn’t about thewedding."
"Ross";"Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be gladto take you for a quick spin around the block."
"Joey";"Yeah, you got a couple hours?"
"Ross";"Whew! That was a brisk ride!"
"Rachel";"Take the top down did ya?"
"Ross";"Only way to fly."
"Rachel";"Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does"
"Ross";"You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver."
"Rachel";"Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader."
"Ross";"Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen mecruising in the bad boy."
"Rachel";"I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross."
"Ross";"What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush."
"Rachel";"Gimme the keys!"
"Ross";"No way!"
"Rachel";"Well no brush!"
"Ross";"Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter, because, if I remembercorrectly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom."
"Rachel";"(to the woman) Alimony. (Runs outside.)"
"Monica";"Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad."
"Chandler";"Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him aninvitation."
"Monica";"Chandler! He’s your father; he should be at the wedding."
"Chandler";"I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not the close. Ihaven’t seen him in years."
"Monica";"Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!"
"Chandler";"Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in thesame circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles."
"Chandler";"Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonnabe staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress."
"Monica";"So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil Idon’t care."
"Phoebe";"Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)"
"Rachel";"Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh, nice!"
"Rachel";"My God!"

"Ross";"(grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)"
"Rachel";"What are you doing?! Get in the front!"
"Ross";"In the death seat?!!"
"Rachel";"Oh my…"
"Man";"Hey guys!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey sweetie!"
"Man";"Ready to go?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica’s. I’ll be rightback. (She goes to get it.)"
"Man";"(stopping her) Wait a minute!"
"Phoebe";"What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh.(Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)"
"Joey";"So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?"
"Man";"Over a month."
"Joey";"Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a littlebetter."

"Monica";"It’s your suitcase. We’re going to Las Vegas."
"Chandler";"Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?!No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’llsave!! (Monica just looks at him.) We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can ourwedding be bigger please?"
"Monica";"We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you twotalked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law."
"Chandler";"Y’know we already went over this and I won!"
"Monica";"No you didn’t. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you’remarrying me, you don’t get to win anymore."
"Chandler";"Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to seehim. I don’t wanna."
"Monica";"Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…"
"Chandler";"No-no"
"Monica";"Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he wasthere cheering you on! Okay? That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad."
"Chandler";"He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!"
"Monica";"Who’s Mr. Girabaldi?"
"Chandler";"Does it matter?!"
"Monica";"Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s timethat you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’regonna regret it for the rest of your life."
"Chandler";"Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you."
"Monica";"Yes!"
"Chandler";"So I really never get to win anymore?"
"Monica";"How much did ever really win before?"
"Joey";"Pheebs!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you leanforward I check out your underwear?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah!"

"Phoebe";"I know. They were mine."
"Joey";"Oh. (Laughs.) No! No wait, that’s weird!"
"Phoebe";"No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to trythem on."
"Joey";"That’s weird!"
"Phoebe";"I’m wearing his briefs right now."
"Joey";"That’s…kinda hot."
"Phoebe";"I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick."
"Joey";"Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that."
"Phoebe";"And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actuallymore comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin."
"Joey";"Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your highheels are good for his posture!"
"Phoebe";"There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinkingeven more than you."
"Joey";"Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys."
"Phoebe";"I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with hismasculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could everdo that."
"Joey";"Hey! I"
"Phoebe";"Okay whatever."
"Joey";"You’ve seen my huge stack of porn right? (Phoebe nods.)"
"Rachel";"God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have"
"Ross";"(shocked) You don’t have a"

"Rachel";"I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around."
"Rachel";"Uh-oh. (She starts to pull over.)"
"Ross";"Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in thatmuch trouble."

"Waiter in Drag";"You’re straight. I get it. (Walks away.)"
"Monica";"I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten betterseats."
"Chandler";"No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re yet! I’m notsure I’m ready for that. And besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see meeither."
"Monica";"Why not?!"
"Chandler";"I don’t know if I’ve told you this, but he’s kindatried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years"
"Monica";"What?!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, he’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to NewYork, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y’know it’s all very"

"Phoebe";"Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he’s changed hisname, y’know? Tell Monica I’m sorry."
"Ross";"I think it means he freaked out and left!"
"Phoebe";"Don’t be so negative! Good God! Isn’t it possible that Sorryis sitting in there (Joey and Rachel’s apartment) right now?!"

"Phoebe";"Oh here’s a whole bunch."
"Rachel";"Oh, I mean she’s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and peoplewill be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y’know? Then she’ll have tocome back here and live all alone."
"Phoebe";"(finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Phoebe";"There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it’s positive.Monica’s pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she won’t be totallyalone."
"Rachel";"Oh my God!"
"Phoebe";"I know! Monica’s gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as hersomething new?"
"Rachel";"Oh my God!"
"Phoebe";"Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?"
"Rachel";"No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trashlast night."
"Phoebe";"Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride ispregnant. The groom is missing. And I’m still holding this. (She throws the test backinto the trash.)"
"Rachel";"Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this."
"Phoebe";"Right."
"Rachel";"Okay?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she wasusing?"
"Rachel";"No. Why?"
"Phoebe";"Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it."
"Rachel";"Anything?"
"Ross";"No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn’t heard from him. I-I-Italked to Chandler’s parents again!"
"Phoebe";"You told them he was missing?"
"Ross";"No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they boththink I’m interested in them."
"Rachel";"All right, we’ve got to tell her he’s gone. (Starts to leave.)"
"Ross";"No! Hey! Hey! We can’t!"
"Rachel";"Ross, she’s gonna start getting ready soon!"
"Ross";"Well, can’t you at least stall her a little? I’ll-I’ll goback to some of the places I went last night."
"Rachel";"All right, well how much time do you need?"
"Ross";"Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?"
"Rachel";"One hour."
"Ross";"Give me two."
"Rachel";"Then why do you ask?!"
"Ross";"Okay, wish me luck."
"Phoebe";"Okay. I’m going with you."
"Ross";"Why?!"
"Phoebe";"Ross, you’re tired. You’ve been looking all night. And clearlyyou suck at this."
"Rachel";"All right, I’ll see you guys later."
"Phoebe";"Okay. Wait, do you know how you’re going to stall her?"
"Rachel";"I’ll figure something out."
"Phoebe";"All right. Good luck."
"Rachel";"Thanks."
"Monica";"Hey! Okay, so I thought we’d start with my make up and then do myhair."
"Rachel";"Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me."
"Monica";"About what?"
"Rachel";"Umm… I’m never gonna getting married!"
"Monica";"Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are wedone with that?"
"Rachel";"No Monica! I’m serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it.Become a lesbian or something."
"Monica";"Any woman would be lucky to have ya."
"Rachel";"Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey."
"Monica";"(jumping up) Rachel! You okay?"
"Joey";"Excuse me, Aaron? (The director turns around.) Hi! Umm, I have a littleproblem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn’t supposed to work today, and I havethis wedding that I really have to be at. It’s my best friend’s, and I’mofficiating so I really can’t work past four."
"The Director";"Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can’t stop filmingjust for you. It’s not like it’s your wedding. (Starts to walk away.)"
"Joey";"I’m having surgery!"
"The Director";"What?!"
"Joey";"Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn’twant you to worry about me. But, I’m having surgery today."
"The Director";"What kind of surgery?!"
"Joey";"Transplant."
"The Director";"But you’re supposed to work on Monday."
"Joey";"Hair transplant."
"The Director";"But you’re not bald."
"Joey";"It’s not on my head."
"The Director";"Look Joey, there’s nothing I can do. Besides, you’reprobably gonna be out by four anyway. We’ve just got one short scene. It’s justyou and Richard, and God knows he’s a pro. You’ll be fine. (Walks away and seesRichard entering.) Morning Richard."
"Joey";"Hey! You’re here! Great! Great! Great! Let’s get going buddy,we’ve got a scene to shoot!"
"Richard";"I’m wearing two belts."
"Joey";"Are you drunk?"
"Richard";"No!"
"Joey";"Yes you are!"
"Richard";"All right."
"Ross";"We are never gonna find him! He’s one guy in a huge city!"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! Is that him? (She points at someone.)"
"Ross";"That is an old, Chinese woman!"
"Phoebe";"He could be in disguise, y’know."
"Ross";"Aw, y’know…Y’know, maybe we’re-we’re justapproaching this all wrong. If you’re Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is thelast place on Earth people would think you’d go?"
"Ross";"So this is your office?"
"Chandler";"How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!"
"Phoebe";"What the hell are you doing?!"
"Chandler";"Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’mrelated to Monica. How is she?"
"Ross";"She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And shedoesn’t have to know, okay? Now come on, we’re going home."
"Chandler";"No! No! No! I can’t do that!"
"Phoebe";"Why not?!"
"Chandler";"Because if I go home, we’re gonna become the Bings! I can’tbe the Bings!"
"Ross";"What’s wrong with being the Bings?"
"Chandler";"The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they usethe pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!"
"Ross";"Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up toyour hotel room?"
"Chandler";"No."
"Ross";"Then you are neither of your parents!"
"Chandler";"It’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look ateverybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! AndI’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn!None of my proceeds go to charity."
"Phoebe";"But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than Ido. But I totally believe you can do this."
"Chandler";"I want to. I love her so much, but I’m afr…It’s toohuge."
"Ross";"Y’know, okay. You’re right. It is huge. So why don’t wetake it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; justforget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?"
"Chandler";"Well yeah, but then…"
"Ross";"(interrupting him) Yeah—No-but-but-but-but! We’re just gonna gohome and take a shower. Now, that’s not scary right?"
"Chandler";"Depends on what you mean by we."
"Rachel";"The nights are the hardest. (Checks her watch.) But then the day comes!And that’s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again…"
"Monica";"(interrupting) The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm,Rachel I’m sorry! I have to start getting ready! I’m getting married today!"
"Rachel";"I know. At dusk. That’s such a hard time for me."

"Rachel";"Okay. But wait!"
"Monica";"What?!"
"Rachel";"Let’s go to lunch."
"Monica";"I can’t go to lunch!!"
"Rachel";"Right."
"Rachel";"Oh good God! I’ve fallen down! (She trips and falls.)"
"Monica";"(entering) What’s going on?"
"Rachel";"Okay. All right. (Gets up.) Honey listen. When I tell you what I’mabout to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we loveyou."
"Monica";"Okay, you’re-you’re really freaking me out."
"Rachel";"We can’t find Chandler…(Phoebe sticks her head and motionsthat they found Chandler)—‘s vest. We can’t find Chandler’s vest."
"Monica";"How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Found the vest! I mean we’re gonna have to keep an eyeon it, y’know make sure we don’t lose it again…"
"Rachel";"Oh!"
"Monica";"Oh wow! Okay. Don’t scare me like that okay? I mean for a minutethere I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!""
"Joey";"I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!"
"Richard";"That can be arranged."
"The Director";"Let’s reset."
"Joey";"What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!"
"The Director";"Let’s take it from there."
"Richard";"(To Joey) Are you a little off today? It’s going terribly slowly."
"Joey";"Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? AndI’m the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?"
"Richard";"Of course! I’m-I’m sorry. I-I’d hate you to missanything like that on account of me. I can do this!"
"Joey";"Thank you. Thank you."
"The Director";"Still rolling, annnnd action!"
"Joey";"I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!"
"Richard";"Now, that can be arranged! (He brings his sword back and drops it,causing it to fly over the wall.) Slippery little bugger!"
"Phoebe";"So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?"
"Mrs. Geller";"Here comes the bride."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God Monica!"

"Rachel";"Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!"
"Joey";"I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me gountil we get this."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister."
"Joey";"No! No, I’m the minister! All right, look-look, put ‘em both onthe phone, I’ll marry them right now."
"Rachel";"Ugh! Joey, I have to go."
"Joey";"Hey! Don’t you hang up on me! I’ll marry you and me right now! Ihave the power!"

"Mrs. Geller";"Not that old crow, my mother. (They stop and she kisses Monica onthe cheek.) Congratulations darling."
"Mr. Geller";"I love you sweetheart. (He kisses her and they sit down.)"
"Chandler";"You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)"
"Monica";"Not now."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Monica";"(To Chandler) Who is this?"
"The Rabbi";"I am Father Kalebasous."
"Chandler";"(in Monica’s ear) He’s Greek Orthodox."
"Rachel";"(leaning in) As are you…"
"The Rabbi";"Let us begin. Dearly beloved…"
"Joey";"(entering) That’s my line! (He walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) Ican take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, I’m sorry I’m a littlelate. You may be confused by this now, (He’s still in costume) but you won’t beMemorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let’s get started before the groom takes off again.Huh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this manand this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I’ve known Monica and Chandler for along time, and I can"
"Monica";"(To Rachel) He took off?"
"Rachel";"Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.)"
"Monica";"Chandler, for so long I…I wondered if I would ever find my prince,my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort.And in stead, I found everything that I’d ever been looking for my whole life. Andnow…here we are…with our future before us…and I only want to spend it withyou, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don’t want to. You go!"
"Joey";"Chandler?"
"Chandler";"(To Ross) No, that’s okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica Ithought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when Isaw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprisesthat come our way it’s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I wasmeant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I’m sure? (He leans in andkisses her.)"
"Joey";"You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by thestate of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Doyou take each other?"
"Chandler";"I do."
"Monica";"I do."
"Joey";"Yeah you do!"
"Ross";"Rings?"
"Joey";"Aw crap! Okay—uh…uh let’s-let’s do the rings."
"Joey";"We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (ToChandler) Now kiss her again."
"Chandler";"(To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby."
"Monica";"What baby?"
"Chandler";"Our baby."
"Monica";"We have a baby?"
"Chandler";"Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash."
"Monica";"I didn’t take a pregnancy test."
"Chandler";"Then…who did?"
"Phoebe";"Oh and they’re gonna have a baby."
"Rachel";"Uh-huh."
"Conan";"It’s a tradition here on"
"Jennifer";"Once and a while."
"Lisa";"From time to time."
"Conan";"For example, I don’t have to memorize lines. You guys actually haveto remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time. Yes?"
"Matthew";"Our energy just comes way up when there’s an audience here andwhen that happens, something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and itjust doesn’t, it just doesn’t work."
"Ross";"Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didn’t. I did."
"Chandler";"Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh. (He starts laughing, causing everyoneelse to laugh.)"
"Phoebe";"So, we realize that—Oh no… (She resets herself) I’mtelling it! I’m telling it… (She loses it.)"
"Joey";"Ha-ha. Look—Come on, I don’t know what to do…or say. (Helaughs.)"
"Joey";"Ha-ha, very funny. I don’t know what to do! Y’know? Holy crud!"
"Joey";"Ha-ha-ha, very funny. Look, I don’t know what to do! (Long pause, aseveryone cracks up.)"
"Courtney";"It is one of those days!"
"Phoebe";"‘Xcusa seniora, voulez-bere quakay—[Beep]—uck it!"
"Matt";"Wow Pheebs, you-you speak gutter?"
"Conan";"You still get nervous everybody just before a show?"
"Matthew";"Absolutely."
"Lisa";"Everybody."
"Courtney";"It’s amazing like all week long we’ve-we’ve been sayingthe same lines and then the audience is here and we will mess up, and if you mess up once,then you’ll get nervous because you’ll—you know you’ll probably messup again."
"The Director";"Action!"
"Monica";"(holding her hand in front of her face) When you were little you sleptthrough-through the Grand Canyon."
"The Director";"Watch again that hand."
"Courtney";"This’ll be five/ten takes."
"The Director";"Okay."
"Courtney";"Okay. You know it’s gonna happen."
"The Director";"Once again, and action!"
"Monica";"(the hand’s still there) When-when you were little you sleptthrough the Grand Canyon. (She actually itches her nose this time.)"
"Courtney";"Oh! Okay! I’m gonna try it without the coffee cup ‘cause Ithink it’s the left hand that’s messing me up."
"Monica";"When you were little you slept through the Grand—(Pointingagain)—Oh fffff…."
"Monica";"Sorry, let’s go back! ‘Cause you’ve got more to say."
"Lisa";"Do I? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, that’s your fault. I…say."
"Lisa";"I love you."
"Courtney";"I love you! (They hug.)"
"Conan";"But there must be, there must—are a lot of moments over the yearswhere you’re just trying to do your job, something goes wrong."
"Joey";"Hey and, this is a little extra something for y’know, always beingthere for me."
"Matthew";"Hey Joey! The camera hit our wall!"
"Matt";"What?!"
"David";"Ahh! Sh—(Beep)—it that hurt!"
"Jennifer";"Are you okay?"
"Chandler";"Hey Rach! (She breaks up and goes back into Monica’s.)"
"Joey";"Oh yeah? Then how come I keep—(He notices that the marker board theyuse has been left on the entertainment center and holds up his discovery.)"
"Monica";"It was so wild! We told ‘em we were the Gunderson’s in16…"
"Courtney";"(laughing) I spit on her!"
"Jennifer";"(to Lisa)"
"Lisa";"Oh yeah!"
"Jennifer";"With"
"Conan";"It was a little game. Yeah, with an electric buzzer."
"Phoebe";"Oh-ooh, and I brought"
"Lisa";"But le Blanc really doesn’t mess up much."
"Conan";"You don’t verbally mess up, but sometimes physically? You mess up."
"Matt";"I have had some clumsy moments I guess you can call ‘em."
"Lisa";"He fell down once! And we re-did it and we went back. Andhe—(laughs)—he was afraid he was gonna fall down…"
"Conan";"You could actually see him trying not to fall down."
"Joey";"Pheebs! (He looks down as he goes down the step to make sure hedidn’t fall again.) Check it out! (He starts laughing when he realized what he did.)"
"Courtney";"This particular time when he continued to fall or y’know, try notto fall, I was in the room with Matthew and Matthew was like, "Should I do it?""
"Joey";"Pheebs! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! (Hands herone.)"
"Phoebe";"Ooh,"
"Conan";"Matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimesyou like to, you like to fool around a bit. I mean like if something’s naturallygoing wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. True or false?"
"Matthew";"I don’t necessarily like to juice things…"
"Courtney";"He said true or false!"
"Joey";"Oh! Ooh-ooh!"
"Monica";"What are you doing?!"
"Joey";"You’re still a tiny bit on fire there."
"Monica";"Oh geez! Okay! Thanks!"
"Monica";"Well, it was good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell methat?"
"Chandler";"What the fu—(beep)—ck are you doing?!"
"Conan";"Now you guys work with animals a lot. You had to work early on with amonkey…"
"Jennifer";"That damn monkey."
"Conan";"That damn monkey."
"Rachel";"Okay. Okay, see now the one with the feather boa? That’s Dr.Francis. She used to be a man. Oh look! There—(Marcel (Katie) jumps away)—Okay.(And runs behind her on the back of the couch for a little while.)"
"Jennifer";"Katie. Geez! See Katie, come here—Katie! (Katie spills somepopcorn.) Katie, come here Katie. (She obeys and sits where she’s supposed to.) Verygood."
"Jennifer";"Lisa’s laugh though…There’s—It’s soinfectious. It’s one of those things…just forget about it. Once it starts,it’s all gone."
"Rachel";"No y’know, I don’t want to switch! Come on! I can throw wetpaper towels here!"
"Phoebe";"Well at Monica’s you can eat—(Suddenly cracks up.)"
"Lisa";"Okay, shh yeah. ‘Cause it’s not silly."
"The Director";"Here we go."
"Jennifer";"Okay."
"The Director";"And…action!"
"Rachel";"No-no Ph-Ph-Ph-Ph… (She starts laughing.)"
"Jennifer";"(to Lisa) Ready?"
"Lisa";"Yeah."
"Conan";"And then it just builds on itself and there’s no doing the sceneafter. I mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it."
"David";"For me, I have a hard time with le Blanc in particular. When-when—Imean when…"
"Conan";"(to Matt) You bastard."
"Matt";"Yeah, what did I do?"
"David";"…I keep a straight face he-he delivers like this look, a reaction toyou, or a certain take, I-I—I mean I find it"
"Joey";"Mornin’"
"Ross";"Mornin’"
"Joey";"I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can’t even say,"Hmm, noodle soup?""
"Matt";"That’s a good one? (They both laugh.)"
"David";"Now, we should go back and take the other line."
"Matt";"Okay, I’ll just put a little more booze on there. (Pours some moreon.)"
"Ross";"I think, subconsciously…"
"Joey";"(cracking up) Nope, you lost me."
"David";"No! Come on!"
"Joey";"Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start youwalk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross. (Ross lies on thefloor.) I’ll be Monica. Go! (He jumps down and cuddles up with Ross.)"
"Ross";"(jumping up) No! No! No!"
"Conan";"We’ll be right back with more"
"Courtney";"I’m doing my brother."
"Matthew";"That’s…gross."
"Conan";"You uh, you’ve worked with—They always say a performer shouldnever work with pets or children."
"Jennifer";"Aww, the kids."
"The Director";"Action."
"Rachel";"Okay. Now—What is my first line?"
"Ben";"(prompting her) What did we agree?"
"Jennifer";"Okay…"
"David";"The good thing about the young kids though, they’re completelyunpredictable. Which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. But there was onestory…"
"Jennifer";"Oh little Ben."
"David";"Where the story was that I was anticipating that I would be around tohear my son’s first words spoken. But the scene was about that he wasn’tsupposed to be able to speak and, uh for some reason when we started doing the show…"
"Ross";"Hi! We’re visiting!"
"Rachel";"Yay!"
"Ross";"It’s Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Y’know, youmight as well say it because I told your…"
"Ben";"Da…Da."
"Ross";"Can you say Da-Da? See, I’m gonna tell your mommies you said itanyway, so you might as well try…"
"Ben";"Da…Da."
"Ross";"Huh?"
"Ben";"Da…Da."
"David";"Yeah, he’s saying Da-Da."
"Matt";"And then sometimes during the show y’know but you’re like, thescene’s going one way but you’re just tempted to say something another time.Like, do you remember that one where Monica’s baking cookies in our old apartment?"
"Jennifer";"She’s trying to intrigue us to hang out with her."
"Matt";"Yeah, she’s trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us tocome hang out in her new place, and we’re sitting there eating pizza and I think itwas you (Points to Lisa) that said…"
"Phoebe";"What do I smell?"
"Matt";"I think I was supposed to say, "I don’t know," and go overand open the door. And I went…"
"Phoebe";"What do I smell?"
"Joey";"(Pause) Sorry. (Raises his hand in shame.)"
"Matt";"(everyone laughs) And then it was like four takes later before we couldget through it with a straight face."
"Phoebe";"What do I smell?"
"David";"Le Blanc."
"Phoebe";"What do I smell?"
"Joey";"I don’t know, but it smells good. (He gets up and heads for the dooronly to stop short and start laughing.)"
"Conan";"But audiences—You have a live studio audience and they must lovethat. They must love it when they see you guys playing."
"Chandler";"What are you guys doing?"
"Ross";"Nothing."
"Joey";"Nothin’."
"Conan";"So that you will intentionally do somethingthat—they’ll-they’ll intentionally screw it up?"
"Courtney";"Yeah!"
"David";"Yeah!"
"Matt";"(noticing the laughter) Why? What’s the matter?"
"Conan";"(to Courtney) You-you’ve worn a fat suit on the show. And, a lot ofpeople love you in the fat suit. Do you like wearing the fat suit? Is it fun?"
"Courtney";"I’m melting!"
"Courtney";"They made me dance, in the fat suit."
"Conan";"I-I heard some of you guys talking about this earlier, but sometimesthere’s just a word that someone has to say that you’ll get hung up on. Andit’ll just—the way you say the word is funny to everybody else."
"Ross";"That tastes like feet!"
"Matt";"It tastes like (mimicking him in a high-pitched voice) feet!"
"David";"Okay, we’re good."
"The Director";"Action!"
"Ross";"That tastes like feet!"
"Matt";"Sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny andyou’ll—we’ll be rehearsing during the week and youjust—whatever-whatever the joke is; it’s so funny we can’t get through itin rehearsal and just…"
"Jennifer";"You just know."
"Matt";"You-you mentally make a flag on it and you say, "Okay show night,I’m just—I’ll never be able to get through this.""
"Monica";"Are you saying that you don’t want to get with this?"
"Chandler";"You see, I don’t say—(Starts laughing.)"
"Phoebe";"(spitting the cookie out onto a napkin) Oh, sweetJe—(Beep)—sus! Oh! Monica, these are the (laughing) cookies they serve in hell!"
"Chandler";"(noticing the woman on the screen) Whoa! She’s purty!"
"Joey";"Oh yeah, and she’s really nice too! She taught me about y’know,how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting."
"Monica";"Joey?"
"Rachel";"I’m sorry…"
"Ross";"Excuse me, what?"
"Conan";"When you have to do physical business for a scene, I mean there must be;there must be a lot of funny moments when you have to physically do a task as part of ascene."
"David";"Yeah, Rachel, Chandler, and Ross had to try to get a couch up astair—a very narrow New York stairwell and that was probably…I-I think it wasthe hardest I’ve-I’ve laughed in my life period."
"Ross";"Pivot! (They pivot) Pivot! (They pivot) Okay, pivot! Piv-at! (He startslaughing.)"
"Ross";"Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!"
"Chandler";"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!"
"David";"Pivat!! (In a high pitched voice) Pivat!!!"
"Conan";"You’ve done over 150 episodes, but your favorite moments that 80years from now you’ll be thinking about?"
"Matthew";"It is when we’re able to crack each other up."
"Chandler";"Monica’s gotta have the phone in the right placeand—(Frantic babbling.)"
"Ross";"(To Chandler) All right! All right! All right! (To Joey) We"
"David";"He’s gone. He’s…"
"David";"We enjoy watching each other. And I settle for watching each other’sperformance, and we like each other."
"Ross";"Oh the band’s ready! And well—I-I—we gotta do what the bandsays, right? I don’t care about the stinkin’ band!!"
"Conan";"Okay"
"David";"Well thank you so much."
"Jennifer";"Thank you Conan!"
"Matthew";"Well thank for coming here, it’s good to see you."
"Phoebe";"Thank you my babies. (Waves good-bye.)"
"Monica";"Oh what are doing?!"
"Joey";"You’re still a tiny bit on fire there!"
"Monica";"I think you got it!"
"Courtney";"I’m sorry, I messed up."
"Matt";"I’ll do it again and again if you want."
"Ross";"No-no! I’ll-I’ll… (He takes too much and some falls out ofhis mouth, which starts him laughing.)"
"David";"That is too much!"
"Matthew";"Let me start that again."
"Photographer";"Great. (Takes a picture.) Great! Just give me a sec to changefilm."
"Monica";"Okay."
"Ross";"(To Monica) Okay, I know I’m not supposed to know, but I do. AndI’m so excited for you!"
"Joey";"What? What’s going on?"
"Ross";"Monica’s pregnant!"
"Joey";"Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!"
"Monica";"Guys! I’m not pregnant."
"Joey";"Ah. (To Chandler) Slow swimmers? (Chandler looks at him.)"
"Ross";"What?! What do you mean? You-you-you’re not pregnant?"
"Monica";"You didn’t tell anybody I was did you?!"
"Ross";"No! (Pause) I’ll be right back. (Exits.)"
"Photographer";"Now why don’t we get a shot of just Monica and the bloodysoldier."
"Monica";"(To Joey) Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party."
"Joey";"I can’t! I-I don’t have any other clothes here."
"Monica";"Find some! Please! Anything that doesn’t say I-I died tragically inFrance. (Joey leaves to find clothes.)"
"Photographer";"Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and thebridemaids."
"Phoebe";"Okay. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the altar.) HeyMon, why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant?"
"Monica";"Because I’m not."
"Phoebe";"We found your test in the trash, if you’re not pregnant—(Shesees Rachel shaking her head)—It’s because I am."
"Chandler";"What?! What are you talking about?"
"Monica";"What are you talking about?"
"Phoebe";"Yes, I…I am with child. (Flash) And I didn’t want to sayanything because it’s your day; I didn’t want to steal your thunder."
"Monica";"Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! (Flash) Does thislook like a conversation that I want to remember?!"
"Chandler";"Who’s the father?"
"Monica";"Yeah!"
"Phoebe";"I can’t say."
"Monica";"Why?!"
"Chandler";"Why not?"
"Phoebe";"I can’t say because he’s famous."
"Rachel";"Oh my God, who is it?! (Phoebe rolls her eyes.)"
"Monica";"Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us."
"Phoebe";"Okay, okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of mybaby."
"Chandler";"As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin?"
"Phoebe";"What?! Well he never said that to me!"
"Photographer";"Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll getChandler and the bridemaids."
"Phoebe";"How about just the bridemaids?"
"Chandler";"Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal."
"Phoebe";"It is."
"Rachel";"For you. (Chandler leaves.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God!"
"Rachel";"Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can’t deal with this justquite yet."
"Phoebe";"So instead you told me Monica was pregnant."
"Rachel";"You said that she was, I just didn’t disagree with you."
"Phoebe";"Sneaky."
"Rachel";"Oh yeah."
"Photographer";"Smile ladies."
"Rachel";"Oh! (They smile and the picture is taken.) Oh by the way?"
"Phoebe";"Uh-hmm."
"Rachel";"James Brolin?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. andthen I remembered he’s gay."
"Rachel";"Ed Begley Jr. is not gay."
"Phoebe";"(intrigued) Really?!"
"Bandleader";"Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me greatpleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!"
"Chandler";"Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya."
"Monica";"Honey, I’m going to put my hand in your pocket!"
"Chandler";"No?"
"Monica";"No."
"Chandler";"I’ve been taking dancing lessons."
"Monica";"What?!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will neverforget."
"Monica";"Oh that is so sweet!"
"Chandler";"So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?"
"Monica";"Yes."
"Monica";"What’s the matter?"
"Chandler";"I don’t know, it’s these new shoes, they’re allslippery."
"Monica";"Well, are you going to be able to do this?"
"Chandler";"Not well."
"Monica";"Well, the good news is, I don’t think anyone’s looking at us."
"Phoebe";"So, are you ready to talk about it?"
"Rachel";"No."
"Phoebe";"Now?"
"Rachel";"No!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, we’ll talk about something else then."
"Rachel";"Thank you."
"Phoebe";"Who’s the father?!"
"Rachel";"Ugh! Look honey y’know what? I haven’t told him yet, so untilI do I don’t think I should tell anybody else."
"Phoebe";"Yeah. That’s fine. That’s fair. Is it Tag?"
"Rachel";"Phoebe!!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll stop."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Phoebe";"Is it Ross? It’s Ross isn’t it—Oh my God, it’s Joey!"
"Rachel";"Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him."
"Phoebe";"Ah-hah! At least we know it’s a him."
"Monica";"(seeing him) Oh sweet Lord."
"Joey";"I’m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it’s eitherthis or a bathrobe! Look, what’s more important, the way I’m dressed or me beingwith you on your special day?"
"Monica";"Honey, I’m not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someoneelse.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)"
"Ross";"Hi. I’m uh, I’m Ross. I don’t, I don’t believewe’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother."
"Ross";"Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth thosewords.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name."
"Mona";"You think so? I’ve always kinda hated it."
"Ross";"Aw come on, Mona Lisa?"
"Mona";"Uh-huh."
"Ross";"Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’suh—well she’s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of theplant world."
"Mona";"Really?! Well see? I never knew about her."
"Ross";"Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (Sheshows him.) Oh, uh me too."
"Mona";"Oh good. Now there’ll be someone there who likes my name."
"Ross";"(sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the sametable.) Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you’ve just been bumped up to table one. And ifit’s all right with you I’m gonna take your place at table six—MartinClickclocken."
"Joey";"That’s better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go.Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (Theydo a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)"
"Mrs. Bing";"Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. I’d likeyou to meet Dennis Phillips."
"Dennis Phillips";"Congratulations."
"Chandler";"Thank you."
"Mrs. Bing";"Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover."
"Chandler";"Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so."
"Dennis Phillips";"Oh, I’m so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck atauditions."
"Mrs. Bing";"Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show."

"Dennis Phillips";"Oh, thank you. Well if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna goget myself a drink. Be back in a moment. (Walks away.)"
"Joey";"Wow Dennis Phillips! That’s great! How did you guys meet?"
"Mrs. Bing";"Well, it’s a funny story."
"Chandler";"Funny: ha-ha or funny: (Mimes blowing his brain out.)"
"Bandleader";"Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take yourseats, dinner will be served."
"Ross";"Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six."
"Mona";"No, nine. (Shows him the card again.)"
"Ross";"Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way(he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well I’m… (Hegoes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello."
"Joey";"Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips?‘Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would’ve done it all, film,television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that’s just for uglypeople."
"Chandler";"What size shoes do you wear?"
"Joey";"Uh, eleven, eleven and a half."
"Chandler";"Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dancefloor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?"
"Joey";"Uh, I don’t even really know where I left those. Sorry."
"Chandler";"(looking at Joey’s feet) Those aren’t eleven and a half."
"Joey";"Okay fine! I’m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet.But the rest of me is good, I’ll show ya!"
"Monica";"Can you"
"Rachel";"Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now?"
"Monica";"This is so huge."
"Rachel";"Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?"
"Monica";"Of course not nothing is. Between me and you…"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Monica";"…in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?"
"Rachel";"Hey! Y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone canwear everything they’re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just getsthrough!"
"Monica";"How?"
"Rachel";"I don’t know! Maybe they have tools."
"Monica";"Well I-I talked to and uh, she’s definitely going to have thisbaby. Y’know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own."
"Rachel";"Well, maybe that’s, maybe that’s really brave."
"Monica";"Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be."
"Rachel";"Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well."
"Monica";"Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is shegoing to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realizeshe’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?"
"Rachel";"(starting to cry) I don’t know."
"Monica";"Are you okay?"
"Rachel";"Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe."
"Rachel";"Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, andrealizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glasswithout Monica noticing. It doesn’t work.) Oh that’s-that’s actually howthe French drink it."
"Phoebe";"Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin…"
"Monica";"Oh really?!"
"Phoebe";"Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he wouldleave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolinsaid…"
"Monica";"(interrupting) Rachel’s really the one who’s pregnant."
"Phoebe";"(shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?"
"Monica";"How do you feel?"
"Rachel";"I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happeningso fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make. (Takes anothersip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!"
"Phoebe";"Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant."

"Joey";"Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel."
"Ross";"Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, y’know what I have torealize? Maybe I’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with.Y’know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (Hepauses and then exits.)"

"Rachel";"(closes her magazine) Can I get you some water?"
"Ross";"I’m good. I’m good."
"Rachel";"Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved asyou want. (Ross nods.)"
"Ross";"Yeah, I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—Idon’t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom."
"Rachel";"I know. I know, but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time."
"Ross";"What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!"
"Rachel";"They do!"
"Ross";"No they don’t!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns withhis box of condoms.) Well they should put it in"
"Rachel";"Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms."

"Mr. Treeger";"I’ve looked everywhere. There’s no gas leak."
"Joey";"(eating) Huh. So then I can heat this up? (Goes and does so.)"
"Mr. Treeger";"Anyway uh, I’ll get moving on that new door."
"Phoebe";"Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler andMonica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm, they don’t-they don’t have anykids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them."
"Mr. Treeger";"Well I’m gonna have to put on a new lock, they’ll findout anyway."
"Phoebe";"Oh no."
"Mr. Treeger";"(measures the top of the doorframe) Whoa! This looks like an allday job, I’ll have to cancel my yoga class. (Ross walks up.) Hey Ross!"
"Ross";"Hi."
"Mr. Treeger";"Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?"
"Ross";"Sure."
"Mr. Treeger";"Namaste. (Bows.)"
"Ross";"Namaste. (Bows.)"
"Ross";"Oh my God! What happened to the door?!"
"Joey";"So it’s noticeable huh?"
"Ross";"Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her."
"Phoebe";"Didn’t you two already talk?"
"Ross";"Yeah but uh… Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slepttogether, but there’s something else. (Pause) Rachel’s pregnant."
"Joey";"(simultaneously) Oh my God!!! I can’t believe that!!"
"Phoebe";"(simultaneously) Holy mother of God!!!"
"Ross";"With my child."
"Phoebe";"That is brand new information!!"
"Ross";"You already know don’t you?"
"Phoebe";"A little bit."
"Joey";"How are you doing?"
"Ross";"Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think Ihandled it very well."
"Joey";"Well, what did you say to her?"
"Ross";"Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.And then when I turned around she was gone."
"Phoebe";"Oh Ross."
"Ross";"But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97%effective."
"Joey";"(shocked) What?"
"Ross";"I gotta go find her."
"Joey";"Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time theydon’t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!"
"Ross";"Evidently they do."
"Joey";"What?! (Grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)"
"Monica";"I can’t believe we’re here."
"Chandler";"Oh you’ve got to be kidding me."
"Monica";"What? (Monica sees the first couple and gasps.)"
"Front Desk Clerk";"As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you thehoneymoon suite."
"Monica";"No!! You have been screwing us all day!"
"Man";"Who are you?"
"Chandler";"We’re you just ten seconds later!"
"Monica";"Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! Imean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!"
"Woman";"Well you can have the suite if you want. We don’t care about wherewe stay. We’re here to celebrate our love together. We don’t have to get freestuff. We just want to be together."
"Chandler";"(looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff."
"Joey";"Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’from your apartment."
"Monica";"What? Are you serious?! (To Chandler) Joey smells gas!"
"Chandler";"What else is new?"
"Joey";"Yeah and we’d go check it out, but you took away our keys."
"Monica";"Well do something! Get in there!"
"Joey";"How? I guess I could break down your door."
"Monica";"Yeah! Do that!"
"Joey";"And-and you won’t blame us for any damage? (Gives Phoebe a thumbsup.)"
"Monica";"No! (Pause) Are you doing it?! I don’t hear anything! Come on!"
"Joey";"Uh, okay I’ll-I’ll-I’ll break it down. (He hands the phoneto Phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh hey hi, he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door. (Thechair breaks in half.) Okay, we’re in. (She hangs up the phone.)"
"Nurse";"Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?"

"Nurse";"The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram."
"Rachel";"Okay. (The nurse exits.) Oh man, I swear if they sold these at"
"Ross";"Hi!"
"Rachel";"(shocked) Hi!"
"Ross";"Uh we-we need to talk."
"Rachel";"Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I’ve kinda got an el fresco situationgoing on over here."
"Ross";"Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today."
"Rachel";"Okay Ross that’s fine, but can you please stand near my head?"
"Ross";"What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) I’m sorry. I mean I-Ithink I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towardsRachel’s feet) really—I should have been thinking about you Rach…"
"Rachel";"Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!"
"Ross";"Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to bethere through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments, the uh, theLamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry aboutthat ‘til after we get married."
"Rachel";"What married?"
"Ross";"Well yeah, I think we should get married."
"Rachel";"What, because that’s your answer to everything?"
"Ross";"No, because that’s the right thing to do."
"Rachel";"Yeah, maybe if you’re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, arewe?"
"Ross";"No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone."
"Rachel";"Excuse me?"
"Ross";"Come on Rach, you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant."
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Ross";"I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself, how do you expectto have a baby by yourself?"
"Rachel";"I can too eat by myself!"
"Ross";"When have you ever?"
"Rachel";"When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!"
"Ross";"Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!"
"Rachel";"Oh please, you inhale your food!"
"Ross";"I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat!!"
"Dr. Long";"(entering) Am I interrupting?"
"Rachel";"Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father."
"Ross";"But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone."
"Dr. Long";"Huh. Nice to meet you. I’ll get started on this."
"Ross";"(To Rachel, standing by her feet) I don’t know why you can’tadmit that you need me."
"Rachel";"I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!"
"Dr. Long";"Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. (We see Rossand Rachel looking at the screen.) Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby."
"Ross";"Oh my God."
"Rachel";"Wow. There it is, I see it."
"Dr. Long";"Congratulations. I’ll give you two a minute."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Ross";"Thank you."
"Ross";"Pretty amazing huh?"
"Rachel";"I don’t see it!"
"Ross";"What? What?!"
"Rachel";"I can’t see it!"
"Ross";"You-you just said that you did!"
"Rachel";"I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother!I can’t even see my own baby!"

"Chandler";"They’re terrific, and they live right here in the city."
"Monica";"Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call."

"Monica";"All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y’know how ithappened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?"
"Phoebe";"Monica! That’s not right! Start with where."
"Rachel";"Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home fromwork and Ross was already there ‘cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey."
"Joey";"You’re welcome buddy."
"Ross";"(glaring at him) Yeah, thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)"
"Rachel";"And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offeredto help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing youknow out of nowhere Ross comes on to me."
"Ross";"(laughs) Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading."
"Rachel";"What is?"
"Ross";"The lie you just told."
"Rachel";"That-that you came on to me?"
"Ross";"There’s the one!"
"Rachel";"But you did! I mean, let’s be honest."
"Ross";"Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh, it’s-it’s not important.What is important is that, is that we’re having a baby. And it’snot—Doesn’t matter who came on to who."
"Joey";"Whom. (Everyone looks at him shocked.) That’s right."
"Rachel";"You know you kissed me first."
"Ross";"What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending mesignals all over the place!"
"Ross";"Yeah!"
"Rachel";"Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Rossbegging symbols, please show of hands. (Ross raises his hand and no one else.)"
"Ross";"Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what youbelieve! What matters is what happened!"
"Rachel";"Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe Ineed to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?"
"Ross";"Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel, just-just drop it."
"Rachel";"No please, show me how I begged you!"
"Ross";"I can show you, I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) It’s anexpression."
"Phoebe";"I can’t"
"Joey";"Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake."
"Chandler";"Y’know who has a great video camera?"
"Phoebe";"(nasally) Greg and Jenny?"
"Monica";"Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em."
"Chandler";"Let’s call ‘em."
"Joey";"Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!"
"Monica";"(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Eighth street deli?"
"Joey";"Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place."
"Monica";"(on phone) Uh sorry, wrong number. (Hangs up)"
"Chandler";"Here you go. (Shows her the number again.)"
"Monica";"(on phone) Hello? (Listens) (To All) It’s the deli again!"
"Joey";"All right! I’ll have a sandwich!"
"Monica";"(hangs up) I don’t think this number’s right!"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Phoebe";"You got fake numbered."
"Monica";"What?! People don’t do that!"
"Joey";"Oh I think we do."
"Monica";"They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?"
"Chandler";"I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all thoseinsightful, great questions."
"Monica";"And you’ve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!"
"Joey";"Y’know what? Don’t worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe."
"Phoebe";"Excuse me, I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects."
"Ross";"(entering) Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open thedoor!"
"Phoebe";"Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!"
"Ross";"Okay, listen I am not a pervert!"
"Phoebe";"That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise yourright hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!"
"Ross";"Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here’s whathappened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and ahalf ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing."
"Joey";"Personal thing? What personal thing? I don’t know."

"Joey";"(laughs) Yeah I knew what you were talkin’ about."

"Joey";"Whoa, for like months?"
"Ross";"Five to be lying, six."
"Joey";"Six months? Whoa that’s rough."
"Ross";"Well, I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate theuh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky."
"Joey";"The sky’s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!"
"Ross";"Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go wellokay—I’m scared for my health!"
"Joey";"Okay. Okay. Umm…Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It’s this story Icame up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they’re like putty."
"Ross";"Really? Well then tell it to me."
"Joey";"Okay. Now you’re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, butyou have to remember it is"
"Ross";"(sarcastic) I’ll try to control myself."
"Joey";"Okay. (Clears throat) Years ago, when I was backpacking across WesternEurope…"

"Joey";"Have a nice six more months Ross! (Starts to leave.)"
"Ross";"(stopping him) Okay! Okay! Okay. I’m sorry. Please, please, you werein Western Europe and?"
"Joey";"I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. Iwas at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded.And there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly)And across the lake I saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she wascrying…"
"Ross";"(intently listening) Why?"
"Kristen";"Umm, this is great wine."
"Ross";"It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm,a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe."
"Kristen";"Really?"
"Ross";"Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona."
"Kristen";"I studied for a year in Barcelona. (Ross is stunned and worried.)"
"Ross";"Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking…"
"Kristen";"I love hiking!"
"Ross";"(whines) Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of MountTibidaybo…"
"Kristen";"I think its Tibidabo."
"Ross";"Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!"
"Joey";"Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?"
"Ross";"Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Yourstory sucks!"
"Joey";"Hey! Look, if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tellit right! Show me how you did it."
"Ross";"No! No, I don’t…don’t want to."
"Joey";"How long since you’ve seen a girl naked?"
"Ross";"I was backpacking across Western Europe."
"Joey";"I’m not feeling it."
"Ross";"I was just outside Barcelona, hiking…"
"Joey";"No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot?"
"Ross";"It’s been six months! I’m always hot!"
"Joey";"Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like; it’s like youdon’t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do whenI’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera andyou can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong."
"Ross";"I’ll try that."
"Joey";"All right now… All right, you’re all set up. You’re good togo. Just hit record. All right?"
"Ross";"Thanks."
"Joey";"Good luck."
"Ross";"Thanks. And-and hey Joe?"
"Joey";"Yeah?"
"Ross";"Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’llhelp you out."
"Joey";"(trying not to laugh) That means a lot to me man. (Exits.)"
"Ross";"Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?(Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!"
"Rachel";"Oh Ross!"
"Ross";"Hi!"
"Rachel";"Thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talkingto yourself?"
"Ross";"That’s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was."
"Ross";"(voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot aboutthe camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything."
"Chandler";"Yeah, we’re gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of themagree.)"
"Monica";"Yeah, definitely."
"Ross";"What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!"
"Joey";"Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget thetape!"
"Ross";"Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, "You’ll show me right?")No!"
"Joey";"You’re right. (Mouths, "I know you’ll show me, right?)"
"Ross";"Joey! No!"
"Joey";"Loud and clear! (Mouths, "You’ll show me," and nods.)"
"Monica";"I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number."
"Joey";"Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’tgive you real names either."
"Monica";"Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give outfake names."
"Joey";"Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you."
"Phoebe";"Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)"
"Chandler";"I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong."
"Monica";"I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes."
"Chandler";"I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!"
"Monica";"(rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey andPhoebe laugh.)"
"Chandler";"Well maybe it was all of your questions."
"Monica";"What about my questions?"
"Chandler";"The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!"
"Monica";"Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?"
"Chandler";"(angrily) Was that another question?"
"Rachel";"(entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?"
"Joey";"Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and itdoes, it sounds like an honest mistake."
"Rachel";"Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I tapedit? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father ofmy child, the porn king of the west village."
"Ross";"Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, Ididn’t even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) Ithought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)"
"Rachel";"Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it withher shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They allyell again.) You don’t want to see this do you?"
"Monica";"Hell yeah!!!"
"Rachel";"I am"
"Phoebe";"No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it."
"Ross";"Forget it, she’s destroying it."
"Phoebe";"Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to putthe whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!!"
"Ross";"Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can dowhatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story."
"Rachel";"I wanna see it."
"Ross";"What?!"
"Rachel";"Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’twant people to see this tape either, but you so badly don’t people to see it makes mewant to see it. You see?"
"Joey";"(confused) Are we watchin’ the tape or not?!"
"Ross";"I don’t want people to see it for your sake."
"Rachel";"Ahh, I don’t believe you. I think you don’t want them to seeyou begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the VCR)"
"Ross";"Rachel, please…"
"Rachel";"Ah, a little preview!"
"Ross";"Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the highroad, because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying…(He laughs and points atRachel sarcastically.)"
"Rachel";"Okay, here we go. (Pushes play.)"
"Ross";"(on tape) Hello! Can I get you anything?"
"Joey";"(To Phoebe) I’m so happy!"
"Rachel";"(on tape) Oh, thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were youjust talking to yourself?"
"Rachel";"There I am."
"Phoebe";"You’re gonna get pregnant."
"Rachel";"(on tape) I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and sendall these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I…"
"Ross";"(on tape) You didn’t do it?"
"Rachel";"(on tape) I-I know—I had put them in…in-in my desk at work andI completely forgot about them until today."
"Monica";"(taking Rachel’s hand) Sweetie okay. It’s okay. Everybody madeit to the wedding. I’m fine."
"Rachel";"Kinda hurtin’ my hand though."
"Monica";"I know."
"Rachel";"(on tape) (Ross hands her a glass of wine) I cannot believe that I didthis. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! (Mimicking Monica)"Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please,drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!" (She tilts her wine glass aboveand moves it back and forth across the invitations) Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh!Oh…oh-oh-oh…"
"Chandler";"Did you do"
"Ross";"(pause) Not on the ones we sent out."
"Chandler";"So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framedinvitation down onto the table.)"
"Rachel";"(on tape) Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seemslike yesterday they just got engaged."
"Ross";"(on tape) I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged?How uh, you and I almost…"
"Rachel";"(on tape) Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would’vegone through with it? Y’know, if we hadn’t gotten caught. Do you think wewould’ve done it?"
"Ross";"(on tape) I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn’tsure if you wanted to."
"Rachel";"(on tape) Oh I wanted to."
"Ross";"(on tape) So we…we both wanted to."
"Rachel";"(on tape) Interesting."
"Ross";"(on tape) Yeah. (Pause) Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best."
"Rachel";"(on tape) Oh yeah, sure."
"Rachel";"Okay, in about ten seconds you’re gonna see him kiss me."
"Ross";"And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why."
"Rachel";"(on tape) Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I wentbackpacking through Western Europe?"
"Rachel";"Okay, get ready to see some beggin’!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, you came on to Ross!"
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Ross";"Now I’m so happy."
"Rachel";"What are you talking about?!"
"Monica";"You used the Europe story!"
"Chandler";"That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!"
"Rachel";"How do you know about that story?!"
"Joey";"How do"
"Rachel";"I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!"
"Joey";"(raises his hand) Some guy!! (Points to himself.)"
"Rachel";"No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams."
"Joey";"(raises his hand and points to himself again) Ken Adams!!"
"Ross";"Hi."
"Rachel";"So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?"
"Ross";"Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing reallydoesn’t matter. I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if youhadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve."
"Rachel";"It was an amazing night."
"Ross";"It was. It was an amazing night."
"Rachel";"You think it looked amazing?"
"Ross";"I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watchit."
"Rachel";"Yeah, me neither. Yet…"
"Ross";"Uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird."
"Rachel";"Yeah, it would be really weird."
"Ross";"Good luck."
"Rachel";"Good luck to you."
"Ross";"Mind if I mute?"
"Rachel";"Oh please. (He does so.)"
"Ross";"Oh, oh there go the clothes."
"Rachel";"You are undressing very quickly."

"Mr. Franklin";"Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil."
"Chandler";"You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how Iget around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?"
"Mr. Franklin";"You’re a joker Bing. (Walks away.)"
"Chandler";"What’s funny about that?"

"Ross";"Did that guy just call you Toby?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, he thinks that’s my name."
"Ross";"Well, why don’t you correct him?"
"Chandler";"Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean thefirst time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t sayanything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" AndI-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’mstill Toby."
"Ross";"Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!"
"Chandler";"No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in differentdepartments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in awhile. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s callingme Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)"
"Ross";"(laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizessomething.) Oh my God! Chandler"
"Chandler";"Shh! It is a family name!"
"Ross";"Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?"
"Joey's Co-Star";"Drake, I’ve discovered the reason for all your headachesand memory loss."
"Dr. Drake Ramoray";"What is it?"
"Joey's Co-Star";"Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. Itseems your body is rejecting Jessica’s brain."
"Dr. Drake Ramoray";"Is it serious?"
"Joey's Co-Star";"Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesizeantibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting thebrain."
"Dr. Drake Ramoray";"Well that sounds simple enough, let’s just do that."
"Joey's Co-Star";"We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica’s body, it wasgone."
"Director";"Cut! Very nice people!"
"Joey";"(To Rachel) Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner."
"Rachel";"Well don’t—What happened to Jessica’s body?!"
"Joey";"I’m not telling, you’ll have to see it on TV!"
"Rachel";"You don’t know do you?"
"Joey";"No, couldn’t care less."
"Joey's Co-Star";"Hey good scene man."
"Joey";"Hey you too!"
"Joey's Co-Star";"Alright."
"Joey";"What? You weren’t in it."
"Rachel";"Oh! (Motions to Joey’s co-star.)"
"Joey";"Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?"
"Kash";"Yes?"
"Joey";"This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel."
"Rachel";"Hi."
"Kash";"Hey! How come I haven’t seen you here before?"
"Rachel";"Well, Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know, hethinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not.Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. (Startsstroking his arm) And uh, and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that,I’m just stroking your arm."
"Joey";"(grabbing her) Here we go! Here we go! (Starts to pull her away fromKash.)"
"Rachel";"Oh, we’re leaving. Bye Kash."
"Kash";"Bye."
"Rachel";"Say hi to Wally."
"Phoebe";"Ooh Monica!"
"Monica";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! I had the"
"Monica";"I…I have to fire him."
"Phoebe";"But why?!"
"Monica";"Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, lastnight he lit my pastry chef on fire!"
"Phoebe";"Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be veryintimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be takendown a peg or two."
"Monica";"Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished."
"Phoebe";"But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him anotherchance? Please?"
"Monica";"(thinks about it) All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire heis out of there!"
"Phoebe";"That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when hegot the pastry chef he got you a little bit too."
"Monica";"I paid to have this done."
"Phoebe";"Love it!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Joey";"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thoughtyou were charming."
"Rachel";"I thought I was a complete idiot."
"Joey";"Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go outwith him."
"Rachel";"Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?"
"Joey";"I said no."
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Joey";"What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re notgonna be seeing people."
"Rachel";"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what didhe say when you told him I was pregnant?"
"Joey";"I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people.This is back when I thought Kash was still people."
"Rachel";"Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him callme okay?"
"Joey";"Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great…"
"Rachel";"Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet moreactors! I’ll meet ‘em all!"
"Chandler";"Hey Bob."
"Bob";"Hey! How’s my pal Toby doing today?"
"Chandler";"If I see him, I’ll ask."
"Bob";"(laughs) Toby!"
"Mr. Franklin";"Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?"
"Chandler";"Yeah!"
"Mr. Franklin";"Oh then you know each other."
"Chandler";"We’re on a semi-first name basis."
"Mr. Franklin";"What do you think of adding him to our team?"
"Chandler";"Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know ifhe has what it takes."
"Mr. Franklin";"Really? They love him down on six."
"Chandler";"But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here."
"Mr. Franklin";"Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put."
"Chandler";"I think it’s best sir."
"Mr. Franklin";"But we really do need to find someone up here. The work isstarting to pile up. I’ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high. (Holds hishand at shoulder level.)"
"Chandler";"Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder andclaim you never got ‘em."
"Mr. Franklin";"(laughs) That’s a good one. (Walks away.)"
"Chandler";"What does a guy have to"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has"
"Phoebe";"But…"
"Monica";"No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommendedhim to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!""
"Phoebe";"Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today."
"Monica";"Why not?!"
"Phoebe";"Because I’m dumping him today."
"Monica";"What?! You said he was sweet!"
"Phoebe";"He"
"Monica";"Just don’t pick up your phone."
"Phoebe";"Then he comes over! (Mimicking him) "I’m so worried aboutyou." Uck! Be a man!"
"Monica";"What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?"
"Phoebe";"You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll killhimself."
"Monica";"Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him foranother week."
"Phoebe";"Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill"
"Monica";"Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have todeal with it!"
"Phoebe";"Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoevergoes second is the bitch."
"Monica";"What do you mean?"
"Phoebe";"Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch!And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!"
"Monica";"I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first."
"Phoebe";"All right, that makes sense. (Starts towards the door.) Ugh.But—Screw you I’m going first! (She grabs her purse and runs out.)"
"Bob";"Hey Toby, you got a sec?"
"Chandler";"Sure, what’s up?"
"Bob";"I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, butI just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I’m not eleventhfloor material. Say uh, who the"
"Rachel";"Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinkingon this date tonight. "Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon,"or "I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?""
"Ross";"(entering with a pizza and beer) Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Ross";"So, what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at theAngelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?"
"Joey";"No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya."
"Ross";"Rach? You wanna come?"
"Rachel";"Oh no, I can’t. I got a date."
"Ross";"A date?"
"Rachel";"Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?"
"Ross";"Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular.It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull."
"Joey";"It’s no Ukrainian film."
"Rachel";"Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! (Goes into her room.)"
"Ross";"A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?"
"Joey";"I set her up with this actor on my show."
"Ross";"You set her up?!"
"Joey";"No"
"Ross";"Joey what-what were you thinking?!"
"Joey";"Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Rosshasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!"
"Ross";"Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby!Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actortaking them?"
"Joey";"Hey! I’m an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too! I’mnot sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on StatenIsland."
"Ross";"A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerousthose are?!"
"Joey";"Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go likefive miles an hour?"
"Ross";"Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’sa fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!"
"Kash";"Hey Joey."
"Joey";"Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash."
"Kash";"Hey."
"Ross";"Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight."
"Kash";"Yeah."

"Kash";"Hey Rachel! You ready to go?"
"Rachel";"Yeah! All right, I’ll see you guys later."
"Ross";"Okay. Have a great time you guys."
"Rachel";"Thank you."
"Kash";"Thank you."
"Ross";"Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear theentire sentence.)"
"Tim";"(walks behind Phoebe) Hi! (And startles her.)"
"Phoebe";"Hi."
"Tim";"Oh, I’m so glad you called. I feel like it’s always me callingyou. So, what’s up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?"
"Phoebe";"It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy."

"Phoebe";"Okay I can’t let you do this! She’s lying to you."
"Eric";"What?"
"Phoebe";"She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. (She grabsUrsula’s purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) Okay. Okay.Yeah—Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.(Holds up her nametag.) Okay, here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she worksas a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here’s her driver license, thisoughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?"
"Eric";"She told me she was 25."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I almost don’t want to show this. (Hands it to him.) Justremember I’m a minute younger."
"Eric";"I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She’s not a teacher.There’s not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children ofspies."
"Phoebe";"No. You’re not, you’re not stupid."
"Eric";"I’m not smart. (Phoebe has no comeback.) I just wanted so muchto…be impulsive once. To be romantic."
"Phoebe";"That’s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic.Just…you did it with the wrong person. (He looks at her.) What?"
"Eric";"It’s just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different."
"Ursula";"(yelling from downstairs) Eric!! Let’s go!!"

"Phoebe";"Yeah, you should. (They shake hands.)"
"Ursula";"Hurry up I gotta pray!!"

"Joey";"That’s not so bad."
"Rachel";"No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh,I am just"
"Joey";"Come on! You’re good with kids. They’re just crazy on Halloween.Y’know, they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!"
"Rachel";"Really? You think that’s all it is?"
"Joey";"Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas…and theirbirthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they’re hungryor sleepy. Y’know, kids are tough. Good luck with that. (Walks away.)"
"Monica";"Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost."
"Chandler";"Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win."
"Monica";"(laughs) Is that a secret or a lie."
"Chandler";"No, I let him win—Ross!"
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Chandler";"Would you tell her I let you win please?"
"Ross";"Oh. Yeah. (Sarcastically) Uh Chandler"
"Chandler";"I am strong! I’ll show you! (He sits down at the table.)"
"Monica";"Chandler please!"
"Chandler";"Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?"
"Monica";"Let’s go big bunny!"
"Chandler";"Okay. 1…2…3—Go! (Once again he’s at a stalemate,but this time he’s in pain.) (Pause) I’m gonna kill myself!"
"Monica";"Hey."
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Monica";"Oh my God! You cleaned! (Gasps) Look at these floors! You did thewindows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And naggingworks!"
"Chandler";"Y’know uh, I didn’t actually do this."
"Monica";"Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?"
"Chandler";"No, it wasn’t you."
"Monica";"Well then who?"
"Chandler";"I got a maid. Yay!"
"Monica";"(shocked) I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other womanwas here cleaning then…"
"Chandler";"Uh honey, I know you don’t like to relinquish control…"
"Monica";"Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!"
"Chandler";"Look, she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adoredthe way that you arranged the sponges."
"Monica";"Did she really say that?"
"Chandler";"Yes, I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Nowjust give her a chance, okay?"
"Monica";"Fine, I can do it. (Gets anxious.) Whew."
"Chandler";"What’s the matter?"
"Monica";"Well, usually when I’m this anxious, I clean!"
"Phoebe";"(looking around) Who’s cell phone is that? It’s just soannoying; everywhere you go."
"Ross";"I think it’s coming from your bag."
"Phoebe";"(checks) I never get calls!! (Answers the phone) Hello?"
"Eric";"Hi, it’s Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursula’s fianc�e."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how’d you get this number?"
"Eric";"Oh, I have a friend who’s a cop and he got it for me."
"Phoebe";"Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise."
"Eric";"Uh listen, I just—I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula."
"Phoebe";"Oh you did? (To Rachel) He did it! He did it!"
"Rachel";"Wow! What did he do?"
"Phoebe";"Shhh! I’m talking."
"Eric";"Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who…eatslunch."
"Phoebe";"Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since youjust broke up with my sister."
"Eric";"Yeah uh…okay. I’m-I’m sorry. Bye."
"Phoebe";"No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a goodperson. Fight for me."
"Eric";"Uhh, I won’t take no for an answer."
"Phoebe";"Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at yourapartment in two hours."
"Eric";"Great! But wh-wh—How do you know where I live?"
"Phoebe";"I’ve got friends too. Okay, bye."
"Eric";"Bye."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonnabe so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.(Exits.)"
"Ross";"So apparently I’m available for lunch."
"Rachel";"I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting."
"Ross";"You’re moving?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I can’t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don’t wantmy child’s first words to be, (in a baby’s voice) "How youdoin’?""
"Ross";"So does-does Joey know you’re moving?"
"Rachel";"Well, I haven’t discussed it with him yet, but I know he’sgonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her aboutmorning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book."
"Ross";"That’s not really porn."
"Rachel";"Not so much."
"Ross";"Hey, y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heardin the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?"
"Ross";"Well I don’t know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living inmy building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. (Rachellooks at him.) With your permission."
"Rachel";"Yeah that would really be great."
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just diedthis morning out of respect."
"Ross";"Yeah. No. No you’re right."
"Rachel";"Shall we?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter";"Yes?"
"Ross";"Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building."
"Rachel";"And I’m Rachel, an admirer of the building."
"Ross";"I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for yourloss."
"Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter";"She didn’t pass."
"Ross";"What?"
"Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter";"My mother’s still alive."
"Ross";"Oh, thank God!"
"Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter";"It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning,but she’s a tough old bird."
"Rachel";"Ahh."
"Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter";"Are you close with her?"
"Ross";"Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokesher head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)"
"Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter";"You speak Dutch? (In Dutch) Zeer vereerd een vriendvan mijn moeder te ontmoeten. (Translation: I’m very honored to meet a friend of mymother.)"
"Ross";"Y’know I would it’s just painful."
"Rachel";"So she’s really not dead."
"Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter";"No, she’s hanging in there."
"Rachel";"Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in, in aone bedroom or a two?"
"Brenda";"Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where’d you get it?"
"Monica";"Oh well umm, I make it myself! It’s two parts ammonia and one partlemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? We"
"Brenda";"Okay. Uhh, I’m gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now.And, when I come back I’ll clean behind the refrigerator."
"Monica";"(To Chandler) I love her."
"Brenda";"I’ll be back in a minute."
"Monica";"Okay. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.)"
"Chandler";"See? I told you."
"Monica";"She stole my jeans!"
"Chandler";"(pause) What?"
"Monica";"I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!"
"Chandler";"So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in frontof you?"
"Monica";"Don’t you see? It’s the perfect crime!"
"Chandler";"She must’ve been planning this for years!"
"Monica";"I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeansand I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comesback I will find it and show you that stain!"
"Chandler";"Honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeansmade more than just the one pair?"
"Monica";"I guess."
"Chandler";"So, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before wego…snooping around her crotch?"
"Monica";"Fine. I’m just glad I didn’t give her my secret ingredient."
"Chandler";"Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?"
"Monica";"Yeah! (Laughs.)"
"Phoebe";"Hi!"
"Eric";"Come in, I’m so glad you’re here."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though."
"Eric";"Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back."
"Phoebe";"Oh."
"Eric";"Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. Ijust…I got so angry just looking at her…(Looks at Phoebe)…face."
"Phoebe";"Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah."
"Eric";"I’m sorry. I just…when I look at you I see her. When I see her Iget a little bit angry."
"Phoebe";"Maybe this is too weird."
"Eric";"No wait! There’s only a problem when I look at you. (Sits down on thecouch.) Oh I got it! I got it. (Puts his hands to his eyes.)"
"Phoebe";"No don’t tear out your eyes!!"
"Eric";"I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses."
"Phoebe";"Oh, yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So, is that better?"
"Eric";"Not really. You…you’re blurry, but you still look like Ursula.You’re Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe…If I-if I just don’t look at you for awhile. (Stands up and turns his back to her.) See? It…it works. I’m not,I’m not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!"
"Phoebe";"Look Eric, turn around. (He does so.) Look, I like you, but itshouldn’t be"
"Ross";"Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. (He translatesthat phrase into Dutch.)"
"Ross";"Yeah, we’re done."
"Ross";"Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? (Looks it up in his book.)"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie ontide pools?"
"Ross";"Really?!"
"Joey";"(laughs) No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler."
"Ross";"Sweet!"
"Joey";"All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go."
"Ross";"Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first."
"Joey";"To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you’re"
"Ross";"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available."
"Joey";"Oh, you’re switching apartments?"
"Ross";"It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel."
"Joey";"But Rachel has an apartment."
"Ross";"Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move."
"Joey";"She is?"
"Ross";"Yeah, you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?"
"Joey";"I guess I didn’t really think about it."
"Ross";"(finds the word in the book) Ezel! (Reads the translation.) Hey Gunther!You’re an ezel!"
"Ross";"Damnit!"
"Monica";"Nice jeans!"
"Brenda";"Oh thanks! I like your top."
"Monica";"Oh. (Holds on to it.) (To herself) You’re not gettin’ it."
"Brenda";"What happened?!"
"Monica";"Oh, I fell asleep."
"Brenda";"I was thinking about taking my lunch break."
"Monica";"Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That’ll really work upyour appetite for lunch."
"Brenda";"All right."
"Monica";"Hello."
"Brenda";"What’s going on?!"
"Monica";"I’m sorry. I’ve never had a maid before, is this not okay?"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"How was the game?"
"Joey";"Oh, okay. I…I ate way too much."
"Rachel";"Oh."
"Joey";"Ooh. (Notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) So umm, I wastalkin’ to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place."
"Rachel";"Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would justlet go."
"Joey";"I was kinda hoping you’d stay."
"Rachel";"Oh but Joey, I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here."
"Joey";"No room? It’s a baby. It’s like this big. (Holds his hands abouta foot apart.) Y’know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. (A desk.)Or-or-or we could put it right here. (The chair.) Aw, it’s cute, right? Or-or wecould put it over here. (By the bathroom door.) You wouldn’t even notice it.Where’s the baby? (Mumbles that it’s over in the corner.)"
"Rachel";"Honey, it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a babychanges everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl andtrying to score when there’s a screaming baby around."
"Joey";"I could use a challenge! It’s getting pretty easy."
"Rachel";"Honey, it’s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can’tdo that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life."
"Joey";"I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn’t have tochange."
"Rachel";"I know."
"Joey";"Y’know I blame Ross for this."
"Rachel";"I do too a little bit."
"Joey";"I’m gonna miss you, you’re the hottest roommate I ever had."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment."
"Eric";"Oh no, stay here we’ll keep doing this. I’ll pay you."
"Phoebe";"No, I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later."
"Eric";"Absolutely. (They kiss and Phoebe heads for the door.) I love the way youkiss."
"Phoebe";"Really? That’s the thing I’m worse at! You’ll see.(Exits.)"
"Chandler";"(entering) Hi!"
"Monica";"Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise."
"Chandler";"How come?"
"Monica";"Because I put my head between her legs."
"Chandler";"To see her pants?"
"Monica";"They’re my pants!"
"Chandler";"Are you sure? Did you see the stain?"
"Monica";"No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark."
"Chandler";"God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?"
"Monica";"Fine. (Brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink brastrap on the way.) She’s wearing my bra!"
"Chandler";"Oh dear God!"
"Monica";"My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!"
"Chandler";"And yet you"
"Monica";"Here’s the plan! Okay? I’m going to leave you get a look atBrenda’s bra!"
"Chandler";"Here’s another plan…No!"
"Monica";"I would do it but she thinks I’m attracted to her!"
"Chandler";"Why?"
"Monica";"Did you"
"Chandler";"I fear a jury will see it the same way!"
"Monica";"Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman’s breasts allthe time!"
"Chandler";"You see that?"
"Monica";"Do you see this? (Mimics him drooling over a woman’s breasts.)"
"Chandler";"All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your brawill you just let the woman clean the apartment?!"
"Monica";"Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you’ll know it’s mine because onthe right cup, the lacey part, there’s a very noticeable rip."
"Chandler";"You need new clothes."
"Ross";"Hi. How is she?"
"Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter";"It’s not looking good."
"Ross";"(happily) Oh. (Realizes then sadly) Oh. Well I uh, I brought her somebloemen. (Flowers in Dutch.)"
"Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter";"That’s so sweet. (Takes the flowers.) Would youlike to come in and say good-bye? I’m sure it would mean a lot to her."
"Ross";"Oh I don’t know that it would."
"Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter";"Well, her memory is pretty much gone."
"Ross";"All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey!"
"Eric";"Welcome back!"
"Phoebe";"Hey! (Jumps on the bed with him.) Can we pick up where we left off?"
"Eric";"I don’t know, I’m still pretty tired out from this afternoon."
"Phoebe";"Why?"
"Eric";"Uh, the sex."
"Phoebe";"What sex?"
"Eric";"Our sex."
"Phoebe";"We didn’t have sex."
"Eric";"Well if I didn’t have sex with you, I had sex with someone thatlooked an awful lot like…"
"Phoebe";"(simultaneously as Eric) Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!"
"Eric";"(simultaneously as Phoebe) Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!"
"Phoebe";"You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!"
"Eric";"Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and Ikissed her and…"
"Phoebe";"You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!"
"Eric";"Well I was just so excited to see you."
"Phoebe";"Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird."
"Eric";"No-no it’s not! I don’t want to lose you! It’s-it’slike I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she wasyou—Yeah it is too weird."
"Phoebe";"So I guess this is it."
"Eric";"Yeah. (They hug.) Maybe it’s for the best. You smell just like her."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, so do you."
"Brenda";"(noticing him) What are you doing?"
"Chandler";"I’m leaning. This is where I lean."
"Brenda";"Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch."
"Chandler";"Brenda a bee!"
"Brenda";"What?"
"Chandler";"Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo yourbuttons lest it sting you!"
"Brenda";"I think I know what’s going on here."
"Chandler";"You do?"
"Brenda";"Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it’swrong. You’re married."
"Chandler";"I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Monica";"(looking at Rachel’s jeans) Where did you get those jeans?!"
"Rachel";"You gave them to me!"
"Monica";"No I didn’t!"
"Rachel";"All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got abig ink stain on the crotch."
"Monica";"Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!"
"Rachel";"What bra?"
"Monica";"The pink one with the flowers?!"
"Rachel";"You mean the one that you’re wearing? (Adjusts Monica’s pinkbra strap as Monica looks down her shirt.)"
"Brenda";"(entering) I quit! (Storms off.)"
"Monica";"Sounds about right."
"Rachel";"What is this?"
"Joey";"Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screenshere, (In front of the crib.) so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobileover the crib. And uh—Oh look! Here’s a baby monitor (Holds it up), which untilthe baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?"
"Rachel";"You’re so sweet. (Notices something in the crib.) Oh my God! Andyou gave the baby Hugsy! (A stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket, goggles, and hat.)"
"Joey";"Ahhhhhhhhhhhh…. That-that-that’s really just to show where thebaby would go. Y’know why don’t I hold on to him so that there’s noconfusion? (Takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)"
"Rachel";"But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it’s going to be loud."
"Joey";"I’m loud!"
"Rachel";"It’s gonna be up all night!"
"Joey";"I’m up all night!"
"Rachel";"It’s gonna poop!"
"Joey";"Hello!"
"Rachel";"What about all the women you want to bring home?"
"Joey";"Look, if I’m bringing home a woman who can’t stand being arounda baby, then maybe I don’t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we’ll just do itin the bathroom of the club!"
"Rachel";"Joey, are you sure?"
"Joey";"Yeah! All right—Look, I know sometimes it’ll be hard, okay? But,it’ll also be really…really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay."
"Rachel";"I want me to stay too."
"Joey";"Ohh!"
"Rachel";"Thank you. (They hug.) Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!"
"Joey";"I know! I found it on the street."
"Rachel";"Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition."
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?"
"Joey";"I don’t know."
"Rachel";"It’s moving."
"Joey";"Ew."
"Rachel";"It’s still—(Screams)—It’s got a tail! Get it out ofhere! Get it out of here!!"
"Joey";"Ooh! Ah! Okay! (Quickly drags the crib outside.)"
"Ross";"Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for onelast kiss. But I don’t care, (To Rachel) because you got the apartment. Yes!"
"Rachel";"Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I’m gonna stay here."
"Joey";"Isn’t that great?"
"Ross";"(stutters looking for words) Ezels!!"
"Rachel";"(coming from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs?"
"Phoebe";"Huh?"
"Rachel";"I’m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?"
"Phoebe";"Sure. Yeah, he’s kinda sexy."
"Rachel";"Oh no, no, I’ll be there too."
"Phoebe";"Okay so, we’ll just come up with some kind of signal if it’sgoing well you can take off."
"Rachel";"No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven’t told himI’m pregnant yet."
"Phoebe";"Oh. Why not?"
"Rachel";"‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’sangry."
"Phoebe";"Oh Rachel, this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’"
"Rachel";"What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever sawme doing that again he’d make me eat the entire pack."
"Phoebe";"Wow! Oh well, I will be there!"
"Rachel";"Thank you."
"Phoebe";"Gosh. I’m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. (They bothsit down by the rest of the gang and Phoebe recognizes a man by the window.) Oh. Hey! Whois that guy? I think I know him."
"Monica";"(recognizing him and panicking) No you don’t!"
"Rachel";"(panicking) No you don’t."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God!!! Monica!! He’s the stripper from your bacheloretteparty!!"
"Chandler";"Her what?!!"
"Phoebe";"Your"
"Chandler";"You had a bachelorette party?!"
"Phoebe";"She untied his G-string with her teeth. (Pause) Somebody stop me!"
"Chandler";"I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties!Y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition."
"Joey";"It’s a grand tradition!"
"Monica";"I’m sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!"
"Rachel";"Well you could’ve untied it with your hands."
"Joey";"This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend abachelor party, but no, I wasn’t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!"
"Chandler";"You went home with the waitress."
"Joey";"Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night."
"Chandler";"I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You"
"Monica";"Ugh, I"
"Dr. Green";"How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I-I don’t eat meat."
"Dr. Green";"It’s chicken."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I don’t eat that either."
"Dr. Green";"I’ll never understand you lesbians. (To Rachel) So baby, tellme…what is new with you."
"Rachel";"Well actually umm…"
"Waiter";"(interrupting) Your ’74 Lafite sir."
"Dr. Green";"’74?! I ordered the ’75! That’s a magnificent wine!The ’74 is sewage! Why would you bring me sewage?! (The waiter’s dumbfounded) Isthat a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why you’re a waiter?"
"Waiter";"This is why I told the manager I wouldn’t wait on you tonight!(Runs off.)"
"Dr. Green";"Oh come on! Don’t be such a baby! (Goes after him)"
"Rachel";"(To Phoebe) In case you didn’t notice, that is a scary man."
"Phoebe";"He’s right though, the ’74 is absolute piss."
"Rachel";"This was such a huge mistake. I can’t tell him Phoebe. Ican’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t…"
"Phoebe";"Rachel!"
"Rachel";"No it’s okay, this is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna waita couple years and then the baby will tell him."
"Phoebe";"Why, so he can get mad at the baby?"
"Rachel";"Hey, that is the…baby’s problem. (Dr. Green returns.) Oh,everything okay with the waiter?"
"Dr. Green";"I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were startingto tell me what is uh, what is new with you."
"Rachel";"Well… Umm, I got"
"Dr. Green";"What’s"
"Phoebe";"It’s slang for pregnant."
"Rachel";"Phoebe!"
"Dr. Green";"Are you really pregnant?"
"Rachel";"Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah."
"Dr. Green";"Who is the father? Oh no! Please don’t tell me it’s her!(Points at Phoebe.)"
"Rachel";"No, it’s Ross. It’s Ross. You like Ross. (He just shakes hishead.) Oh daddy, I hope you’re okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this isa good thing. You’re gonna—This is your first grandchild! You’re gonna be apoppy!"
"Dr. Green";"That’s true."
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Dr. Green";"(laughs) Poppy. (To Phoebe) Oh, I’m gonna be a poppy. (Stopslaughing) So when is the wedding?"
"Rachel";"Who?"
"Dr. Green";"The wedding! There’s going to be a wedding. Young lady,don’t you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard! (Rachelpauses) Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!!"
"Rachel";"February 2"
"Mona";"So it was really cool seeing you lecture today."
"Ross";"Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there alittle."
"Mona";"Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y’knowtake it all in."
"Ross";"Yeah, a lot of my students do that."
"Mona";"So, I gotta get going."
"Ross";"Okay, I-I’ll see you tonight."
"Mona";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Okay, bye."
"Mona";"Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection.It was amazing! (She leaves.)"
"Chandler";"My God! You must be good in bed!"
"Joey";"So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How’s it going?"
"Ross";"Ah, it’s good. It’s going good. I mean, we get along great.She’s, she’s so…"
"Joey";"Hot?"
"Ross";"Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!"
"Chandler";"She’s okay with Rachel and the baby?"
"Ross";"Well I…I haven’t actually told her yet. I don’t want toscare her off, y’know?"
"Chandler";"Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think thatyou’re going down the same path, but you’re really going down different ones."
"Joey";"I’m gonna take that book and beat you to death with it."
"Monica";"(entering) Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really badabout the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you’re gonna have a bachelorparty."
"Chandler";"What?"
"Monica";"Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper tocome dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!"
"Chandler";"Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me astripper…"
"Joey";"Will you let the lady talk?!"
"Monica";"Come on! Come on, it’ll be fun! It’ll make me feel so muchbetter."
"Chandler";"Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it’s a little creepy. Y’know?I’m not a bachelor anymore."
"Monica";"So don’t think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a…atwo month anniversary present."
"Ross";"Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! (Joey nods hisagreement.)"
"Monica";"Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!"
"Chandler";"All right fine! But I’m only doing this for you!"
"Joey";"Yeah!"
"Chandler";"And Joey."
"Monica";"Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?"
"Chandler";"Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough."
"Ross";"Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona againtonight."
"Chandler";"I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelorparty?"
"Joey";"(on cell phone) I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby…"
"Phoebe";"I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginarywedding, but I’m"
"Rachel";"I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn’t want him to startyelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour."
"Phoebe";"It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely."
"Rachel";"All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this, I’m gonna tellhim, I’m gonna be strong."
"Dr. Green";"I just called a friend of mine."
"Rachel";"Yeah?"
"Dr. Green";"I think I may be able to book"
"Rachel";"Really?!"
"Dr. Green";"What is it sweetie?"
"Rachel";"There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married."
"Dr. Green";"What?!"
"Rachel";"I’m sorry daddy."
"Dr. Green";"I don’t believe this!!"
"Rachel";"Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please."
"Dr. Green";"Stay calm?!! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptableRachel! And I wanna know why?!! Is it because that punk Ross won’t marry you?!That’s it! Is that it?!"
"Rachel";"Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods."
"Joey";"So you uh, nervous about getting married?"
"Chandler";"What are you doing?"
"Joey";"Look, look let’s pretend it’s a real bachelor party. Okay?Y’know? Before your wedding. Come on, it’ll be fun."
"Chandler";"Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day."
"Joey";"How does it feel knowing you’re never gonna be with another womanagain huh? Knowing you’re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until youfinally have the sweet release of death."
"Chandler";"You’re right, this is more fun."
"Joey";"That’s her! Okay, come on! (They go over and open the door.)"
"Stripper";"Hi!"
"Chandler";"Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.)"
"Stripper";"So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?"
"Joey";"Uh, that-that’s-that’s me!"
"Chandler";"That’s me."
"Joey";"Joey Tribbiani, a big fan."
"Stripper";"So is that a bedroom? (Points to the guestroom.)"
"Chandler";"Yeah, yeah right over there."
"Stripper";"All right, whenever you’re ready. (She goes into the bedroom.)"
"Chandler";"That was weird."
"Joey";"Why-why would she go in the bedroom?"
"Stripper";"I’m waiting."
"Chandler";"So she’s a…"
"Joey";"Yeah, that’s one naked hooker!"
"Mona";"I love your place! Where is this guy from? (A statue from the top of hisapothecary table.)"
"Ross";"Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta."
"Mona";"Oh wow! So, you’re more than just dinosaurs."
"Ross";"So much more."
"Mona";"Oh my God! Oh my God! I’m so sorry!"
"Ross";"Aw forget it, it’s from"
"Dr. Green";"You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?!I’m gonna kill you!!"
"Ross";"Y’know this is actually not a great time for me."
"Dr. Green";"So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachelpregnant!"
"Mona";"You got Rachel pregnant?!"
"Ross";"Who did?!"
"Dr. Green";"You did!"
"Ross";"Yes. Yes, yes I did. (To Mona) But-but it was, it was just a one nightthing. It meant nothing."
"Dr. Green";"Oh? Really? That’s what my daughter means to you? Nothing?"
"Ross";"No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care—I-I loveRachel."
"Mona";"What?!"
"Ross";"(to Mona) Oh but not that way. I mean…I mean I’m not in lovewith her. I love her like a, like a friend."
"Dr. Green";"Oh really? That’s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble andthen refuse to marry her?"
"Ross";"(to Dr. Green) Hey! I offered to marry her!"
"Mona";"Wh…"
"Ross";"(To Mona) But I didn’t want to."
"Dr. Green";"Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!"
"Mona";"Tramp?!"
"Ross";"I’m sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green."
"Chandler";"I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!"
"Joey";"Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker"
"Chandler";"Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missedit. (Walks towards the bedroom.) Ma’am, are you also a stripper?"
"Hooker";"Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but that’s gonna cost extra.Okay, here’s the extras, handcuffs, spanking… (Chandler grunts for her not tocontinue and Joey pulls him back into the kitchen.)"
"Joey";"Maybe Monica’s playing a joke on ya. Y’know? Getting her ownhusband a hooker, that’s pretty funny."
"Chandler";"That is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone."
"Joey";"I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy."
"Hooker";"Do you mind if I smoke in here?"
"Chandler";"Oh actually, I’d rather you…Yeah, go ahead. We’re gonnahave to burn that room down anyway."
"Mona";"How could you have kept all of this from me?"
"Ross";"I was going to tell you, but…"
"Dr. Green";"But what?! You figured you’d get what you wanted and then dumpher like you dumped Rachel!"
"Ross";"Hey! I did not dump Rachel! (To Mona) Nor are we still together. (Thephone rings and Ross goes to answer it, only he’s trapped behind the apothecary tableby Dr. Green.) Can I just… (Dr. Green glares at him.) Why don’t we just let themachine get that?"
"Joey";"(on machine) Hey Ross. It’s Joey. There’s a hooker over here andwe thought maybe you’d know something about it."
"Ross";"No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to, I need to lie down."
"Stu";"So, tonight’s the night of the big bachelor party?"
"Monica";"Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl’s number."
"Stu";"No problem. So who’s the party for?"
"Monica";"My husband."
"Stu";"You hired your husband a hooker?"
"Monica";"She’s a stripper."
"Stu";"No, she’s a hooker."
"Monica";"Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?"
"Stu";"When they’re hookers."
"Monica";"Oh my God Stu! I-I can’t believe you did this! Now are youabsolutely sure she’s a hooker?"
"Stu";"Either that or she’s just the best, most expensive date I ever had."
"Joey";"Maybe she meant to get you a hooker."
"Chandler";"Why would she do that?"
"Joey";"Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anythingyou’re really bad at y’know, sexually?"
"Chandler";"This is the worst bachelor party ever!"
"Hooker";"What’s taking you boys so long?"
"Joey";"In a minute!"
"Chandler";"(To Joey) In a minute? What’s gonna happen in a minute?!"
"Joey";"All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave."
"Chandler";"Why me?!"
"Joey";"Hey! It’s your bachelor party."
"Chandler";"Which is why"
"Joey";"I don’t want to. You do it!"
"Chandler";"You do it!"
"Joey";"You do it!"
"Chandler";"All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!(Joey smirks.) What?"
"Joey";"I miss this."
"Chandler";"I don’t think we’ve actually done this before!"
"Joey";"No, I-I miss hanging out with you."
"Chandler";"Well we…we still hang out."
"Joey";"Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable.Y’know now it’s like…things are different."
"Chandler";"Well y’know, things are different. I’m…I’m marriednow."
"Joey";"Oh sure—And hey, don’t get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys.I just…I miss…hanging out…just-just us, y’know?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we’ll maketime to hang out with each other."
"Joey";"You got it. Come here. (They hug and are observed by the hooker.)"
"Hooker";"Oh God! Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys. (Does the closesign.)"
"Monica";"(entering quickly) She’s a hooker! She’s a hooker! She’sa… (Stops as she sees her.) Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone. (Goes and shakes thehooker’s hand.)"
"Ross";"So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!"
"Rachel";"(quietly) Oh no…"
"Phoebe";"I’d better go. (She goes and sits down in the"
"Rachel";"Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten thisout with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail."
"Ross";"I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and nowshe’s totally freaked out!"
"Rachel";"Oh okay, I’ll fix that to. What’s her e-mail address?"
"Ross";"Rachel!"
"Rachel";"All right, I promise. I’ll fix this. I swear.I’ll-I’ll-I’ll-I’ll talk to her."
"Ross";"Okay!"
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Ross";"Thank you!"
"Phoebe";"That’s it?! You call that a fight? Come on! "We were on abreak!" "No we weren’t!" What happened to you two?!"
"Ross";"Thank you so much for coming back over."
"Mona";"Oh good, you’re here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to beuncomfortable."
"Rachel";"I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I’m so sorry about myfather yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You’re gonna have totell me how you did that."
"Ross";"Focus."
"Rachel";"Okay. Um…But—Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we aregonna have a baby. But we are"
"Mona";"How can I be sure on that?"
"Rachel";"Oh we just—we drove each other crazy!"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let thelittle things go!"
"Ross";"Trying to date this woman."
"Rachel";"Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle andthoughtful he is. (Rubbing his shoulder.)"
"Ross";"Probably shouldn’t touch me."
"Mona";"Y’know, I-I-I just…I don’t want to get in the middle ofsomething so complicated."
"Rachel";"I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I meanwe all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? (Mona looks ather.) I am so gonna leave right now. (Ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)"
"Ross";"Should I leave this open for you too?"
"Mona";"I’m not sure yet. Why didn’t you just tell me about all this?"
"Ross";"Because what’s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feelabout you."
"Mona";"Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me."
"Ross";"I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard itfrom Rachel’s father. Look I…I made a mistake, but it’s only because Ireally, really like you. Really!"
"Mona";"Okay, I guess you can…close the door now. (He does so and they kiss.)"
"Rachel";"(entering) Forgot my purse! (Sees them kissing.) Oh, you guys made up.(To Mona) He’s a good kisser isn’t he? (Ross goes to close the door on her.)I’m going! (Quickly leaves and Ross locks the door.)"
"Monica";"I swear I didn’t know she was a hooker! I mean wh—Did you lether smoke in here?"
"Chandler";"Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you reallywant to talk about smoking?"
"Monica";"Y’know what? I’m gonna make this up to you. I promised you astripper (turns on the radio), and you’re gonna get a stripper. (She starts tostrip.)"
"Chandler";"Monica! Wait!"
"Monica";"What?"
"Chandler";"(puts on his crown) Carry on."
"Monica";"Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I’ll take them off.(Goes to do so.)"
"Chandler";"Could you not narrate?"
"Monica";"Gotcha sailor. (Kicks one of her shoes off and it lands in the kitchenknocking something down, but she continues to strip.)"
"Dr. Green";"(on phone) …just because you’re not in love with the guyyou can’t…"
"Phoebe";"(entering, quietly) Wow, you told your dad the truth."
"Rachel";"About an hour ago."
"Phoebe";"Wanna go see a movie?"
"Rachel";"Yes! (She gets up and sets the phone on the counter without hanging itup.) Bye daddy. (Phoebe and her leave.)"
"Dr. Green";"(on phone, not hearing her) …there’s gonna be a wedding!(Joey enters from his room and goes to get a beer from the fridge.) That’sunacceptable Rachel! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are moreimportant things in a marriage other than love! (Joey hears something and looks around forthe source.) …constantly thinking about things! You have to think about theconsequences of your decision. (Joey finds that the sound is coming from the phone andputs it to his ear.)"
"Joey";"(on phone) Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!(Listens) What gives you the right to… (Listens) Go to hell! (Hangs up the phone andopens the fridge.) Stupid guy on my phone."
"Joey";"Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell upto twice their size and never go back."
"Rachel";"(looking at her fingers) Oh my…God! Let me see that! (Grabs thebook from him.)"
"Joey";"(laughing) You fall for it every time!"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.)"
"Rachel";"Oh Pheebs that’s so sweet—(Grabs a pair of pants)—Ooh,those are so cute!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah! And look, (Grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows?(There’s a stretchy part in front.) And then after the baby’s born, they’re"
"Monica";"(entering) Oh good you’re all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, fouro’clock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert fromhigh school?"
"Rachel";"No."
"Monica";"He was in Ross’s class…marching band…kinda overweight?Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend."
"Rachel";"Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey, are you sure you’re nottalking about your imaginary boyfriend."
"Monica";"No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven’t thought about him in a longtime… (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, ummWill’s, Will’s here on business and he didn’t have a place to go so Iinvited him here."
"Rachel";"Oh that’s nice."
"Monica";"Oh, and by the way, he’s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looksgoo-ood! Okay, I mean"
"Joey";"I just want you to say it once in a while."
"Monica";"All right okay, just so you know, I’m not gonna make a turkey thisyear."
"Joey";"What?!"
"Monica";"Well Phoebe doesn’t eat turkey…"
"Joey";"Phoebe!"
"Phoebe";"Turkey’s are beautiful, intelligent animals!"
"Joey";"No they’re not! They’re ugly and stupid and delicious!"
"Monica";"All right! Okay, it’s just Phoebe. Will’s still on a diet,Chandler doesn’t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel’s having her aversion topoultry."
"Joey";"She is?"
"Rachel";"Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roastchicken?"
"Joey";"Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand andmade it walk across the table."
"Monica";"Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey forjust three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work."
"Joey";"But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with noturkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!"
"Monica";"All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’sgonna be a ton left over."
"Joey";"No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!"
"Monica";"All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in justone sitting?"
"Joey";"That’s right! ‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And thisis what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don’t read alot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!"
"Monica";"Hey, isn’t weird to think about how next year at this timethey’ll be a little baby at the table? (Chandler turns around in horror.) (Seeinghim) Rachel’s! But good to know where you’re at!"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Happy Thanksgiving!"
"Monica";"You too!"
"Phoebe";"Anything I can do to help?"
"Monica";"Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he’sreally into the game so I don’t want to bother him. Could you help me fold thesenapkins? (Hands her a stack of them.)"
"Phoebe";"Sure!"
"Monica";"I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams."
"Phoebe";"Okay. (She starts folding the napkins in half.)"
"Monica";"No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barndance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you atChristmas time, remember?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (ToChandler) So how’s the game?"
"Chandler";"I have no idea."
"Phoebe";"What?"
"Chandler";"Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t haveto help out with stuff."
"Phoebe";"I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has noidea?"
"Chandler";"Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV."
"Monica";"Is your team winning hon?"
"Chandler";"Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) There’s noAnderson."
"Phoebe";"Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can helpyou after all, I didn’t realize"
"Monica";"Oh, I didn’t know you liked football."
"Phoebe";"Well normally I don’t, but y’know…(looks at theTV)…Green Bay is playing."
"Monica";"You like Green Bay?"
"Phoebe";"Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it’s not bad.It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August toJune."
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Will";"Hey!"
"Will";"Happy Thanksgiving!"
"Monica";"Aww thanks! God Will I’m so glad that you came! You look great! Youmust’ve lost like…"
"Will";"150 pounds. Yeah, I’m gonna be in one of those"
"Monica";"A pie! (Will brought a pie.)"
"Will";"Oh right. All right, it’s no fat, it’s no sugar, it’s nodairy…it’s no good. Throw it out."
"Monica";"You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler.Chandler, this is Will."
"Will";"Hey."
"Chandler";"Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into thegame. Plus, I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next toeach other."
"Monica";"This is Phoebe."
"Phoebe";"(nonchalantly glancing) Hey. (Turns back around.) Wow! (Looks up.) Welldone."
"Monica";"(to Will) Wanna give me a hand?"
"Will";"Sure! Monica, I can’t get over how great you look! You look stunning!"
"Monica";"Well you look incredible too! You’re just—you’re so fit!"
"Chandler";"I’m watching the game, but I’m not deaf!"
"Monica";"Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming."
"Will";"Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!"
"Monica";"Good. And Rachel Green too. (Will stops suddenly.)"
"Will";"Oh."
"Monica";"Is there a problem?"
"Will";"Nope. Uh, it’s okay. It’s just uh, God I hated her."
"Monica";"What?"
"Will";"Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it wasa long time ago, I’m in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. Yougot any cakes or cookies or something? (Starts looking.) No Will no!"
"Chandler";"(To Phoebe) Y’know, it’s been a while since we’vescreamed something. Maybe we should."
"Phoebe";"Oh okay."
"Chandler";"Oh come on!"
"Phoebe";"Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!"
"Monica";"Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you’ve got almost anentire turkey to eat."
"Joey";"Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomachfirst. Eatin’ chips is like stretching."
"Monica";"All right."
"Joey";"Don’t worry, Tribbianis never get full."
"Will";"I actually know what you’re talking about. I’m here to tell yousomething my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void."
"Joey";"(To Monica) Who the hell is this guy?"
"Monica";"Will! From high school."
"Joey";"Oh hey!"
"Monica";"(to Will) Joey."
"Will";"Hello."

"Ross";"Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting."
"Will";"Yeah, it’s not. But I’m rich and thin."
"Ross";"Oh! Man I don’t think I’ve seen you since uh, Lance Davis’graduation party."

"Ross";"Yeah. It would’ve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun."
"Will";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Will";"God we were lame back then. Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?"
"Ross";"(laughs) Yeah."
"Will";"So what do you, what do you do now?"
"Ross";"So how long are you in town?"
"Rachel";"(entering, carrying a baking dish) Hi!"
"Monica";"Hey sweetie. Oh good. (Takes the baking dish from her.)"
"Will";"(glaring at Rachel) Rachel Green."
"Ross";"Aw—oh, that’s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?"
"Will";"Oh, I’ll-I’ll be fine. Just God I hate her Ross! I hate her!"
"Ross";"Will, high school was-was a long time ago."

"Rachel";"(sees Will) Oh my God Monica, who is that?"
"Monica";"That’s Will from high school!"
"Rachel";"Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smolderingthing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God, he’s… Lookat the way he’s just staring at me. I think he’s trying to mouth something tome, but I can’t make it out. (Will mouths, "I hate you.")"

"Will";"Right."
"Rachel";"Hi! I’m Rachel Green."
"Will";"Oh I-I remember you."
"Rachel";"Really?! Aren’t you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I amhaving the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around atLance Davis’ graduation party?"
"Will";"You are unbelievable."
"Rachel";"Thank you!"
"Monica";"(breaking it up) Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don’t you sit here? (Nextto Joey) And Will you sit way over there. (The other side of the table.)"
"Joey";"That’s it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. Atleast give me a challenge!"
"Monica";"(laughs) This is Chandler’s chicken. This is the turkey. (Sets downa huge turkey.)"
"Joey";"(quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?"

"Will";"I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel doeswhatever she wants in little Rachel land. (Does a fake hair flip.)"
"Joey";"(To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?"
"Rachel";"Umm, I’m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?"
"Will";"I don’t know? Do I? Do I?"
"Phoebe";"I think you do."
"Monica";"(To Rachel) Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in highschool."
"Will";"A little mean? You made my life miserable!"
"Rachel";"I’m-I’m—I had no idea. I’m sorry. I…"
"Will";"Well you should be. Screw it! Bring on the yams!"
"Monica";"Oh Will. But you-you’ve worked so hard…"
"Monica";"Okay. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will whostarts dishing out a large helping.)"
"Rachel";"Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I’m real sorry for whateverI-I did to you in high school…"
"Will";"Oh, it wasn’t just me. We had a club!"
"Rachel";"You had a club?!"
"Will";"That’s right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!"
"Rachel";"Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Whoelse was in this club?"
"Will";"Me and Ross. (Points at Ross.)"
"Ross";"No need to point, she knows who Ross is."
"Rachel";"(To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?"
"Will";"Yes he was. (Holds up his hand for a high-five.)"
"Ross";"No. No."
"Rachel";"So who else was in this club?"
"Ross";"Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand butI-I don’t think he-he knew what it was."
"Rachel";"So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in anI Hate Rachel club."
"Will";"You went out with her?! We had a pact!"
"Ross";"That was in high school! It’s not like it was binding forever."
"Will";"Then why did it have the word eternity in it?"
"Rachel";"Okay Monica, did you know about this?!"
"Monica";"I swear I didn’t. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys usedto go up to your bedroom and lock the door?"
"Ross and Will";"Yeah."
"Monica";"Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say."
"Ross";"Look Rach I-I’m sorry, okay? I…I was a stupid kid, okay? Theonly reason I joined…"
"Will";"Co-founded!"
"Ross";"…co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in lovewith you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the IHate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club."
"Will";"Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club."
"Rachel";"Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just saymean things about me?"
"Will";"Well, we did a little more than that."
"Ross";"No-no! No-no. No-no."
"Phoebe";"What?! What else did you do?"
"Will";"We started a rumor."
"Rachel";"What rumor?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!"
"Rachel";"Ross!"
"Ross";"It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…thatumm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts."
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Will";"That’s right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raiseyou as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis."
"Rachel";"(shocked) Oh my God!"
"Rachel";"What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)"
"Monica";"Everyone at our school heard it!"
"Chandler";"Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphroditecheerleader from Long Island?!"
"Rachel";"Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! Thisis why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stayin this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)"
"Ross";"Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really ourfault."
"Rachel";"Monica, how come you never told me this?!"
"Monica";"I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry andthen show it to me."
"Rachel";"Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!"
"Joey";"I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof."
"Rachel";"Oh! (Hits him and storms out.)"
"Joey";"You are my Everest."
"Monica";"Joey, you don’t have to finish that."
"Joey";"Oh yes I do. Otherwise what’s next? Today I’m just a guy whocan’t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I’m the guy who eats half a"
"Rachel";"(entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrotein my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, you’re such a good person." Notgirl! Person!"
"Ross";"Rach, I think you’re reading a little too much into it."
"Rachel";"(reading what he wrote again) "Dear Rach, you’re a greatperson. Sorry about your tiney-wienie." (Will laughs.)"
"Ross";"Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in theentire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!"
"Rachel";"Yes!"
"Will";"Could you also tell them I’m skinny now?"
"Monica";"Oh! Me too!"
"Ross";"Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a millionyears ago!"
"Rachel";"I don’t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was halfand half! Y’know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you inhigh school."
"Monica";"That’s not totally true."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Ross";"What?"
"Monica";"Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs.Altman, our 50-year-old librarian."
"Ross";"(shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!"
"Monica";"It’s true?!!"
"Ross";"No."
"Rachel";"Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!"
"Will";"Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he wentback to Thailand."
"Chandler";"I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a50-year-old woman?"
"Ross";"Hey! She didn’t look 50!"
"Chandler";"Did she look 16?"
"Rachel";"Ohh, there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually."
"Phoebe";"Oh! (They all look.) Wow!"
"Ross";"She didn’t photograph well!"
"Chandler";"Well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spentmost of her life sitting for oil paintings!"
"Phoebe";"So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early birddinner?"
"Ross";"I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two ofus. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you mustknow, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace…"
"Monica";"Didn’t she walk with a cane?"
"Ross";"Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I can’t believe you-you toldpeople about this?! Everybody knew?! Y’know what? (To Will) I’m back in theclub!"
"Will";"Yeah! (They high-five.)"
"Phoebe";"I wanna join!"
"Rachel";"Wh—Phoebe!!"
"Phoebe";"I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-Ididn’t go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learnFrench. Bonjour."
"Rachel";"All right, y’know—Fine! You guys have your stupid little club,but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you!You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)"
"Monica";"All right, listen you’re just being silly. Rachel, even with thatrumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you.One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a"
"Rachel";"Wow…"
"Monica";"And Ross, if it weren’t for Rachel’s rumor I mean no one inhigh school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!"
"Ross";"As a romancer of the elderly."
"Monica";"Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to bepretty."
"Ross";"The eyes…did still sparkle."
"Monica";"Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you’ve beenthrough so much since then. And right now you’ve got so much more important stuffgoing on in your life. Can’t you just let this go?"
"Rachel";"She’s right."
"Ross";"Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together."
"Will";"Hold on! You got her pregnant?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Will";"Are ya getting married?"
"Ross";"Nope."
"Will";"So you knocked her up but you’re not gonna marry her. Dude! (Wantsanother high-five and Ross ignores him.) Anybody?"
"Phoebe";"Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) It’s exactly how I’d imaginedit would be."
"Joey";"(entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All rightwhere’s that turkey!"
"Phoebe";"Joey! Those are my maternity pants!"
"Joey";"Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!"
"Joey";"Well that’s it. I’m done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) There comethe meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)"
"Monica";"Well Joey, we’re all…we’re all very proud of you."
"Chandler";"Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now."
"Phoebe";"Is there anything we can do for you?"
"Joey";"No just, nobody press on my stomach."
"Rachel";"You can keep those pants by the way."
"Joey";"Whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?"
"Monica";"Yeah, you want some?"
"Joey";"Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.)A little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves theknife again.) What?! Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!"
"Monica";"Hey! So what do you think?"
"Chandler";"New haircut? (Monica nods ‘No.’) Necklace? (No) Dress? (No)Boots? (Monica nods ‘Yes.’) Boots!"
"Monica";"Yes! Now, they’re a little more than I normally spend onboots…or rent (Shows him the receipt.)"
"Chandler";"Oh my God!"
"Monica";"I know."
"Chandler";"I’m gonna miss being able to afford food."
"Monica";"I’m sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswomanwas looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you.""
"Chandler";"She had a point. (Shows her the receipt.)"
"Rachel";"(entering) Hi!"
"Monica";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! (Notices the boots) Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!"
"Monica";"They’re mine!"
"Chandler";"Yeah well, too bad we’re gonna have to return them."
"Rachel";"Return them?! Shh! They’re gonna hear you!"
"Monica";"Honey, I’m not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost alot, but I’m going to wear them all the time. You’ll see. Besides, I love thecompliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?"
"Chandler";"I have you."
"Monica";"Nice try; I’m keeping the boots."
"Ross";"That’s right, I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you allthe time."
"Phoebe";"How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?"
"Rachel";"(pause) He’s talking to the baby."
"Phoebe";"Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, "I can’t wait tohear your first words," I thought, "There’s a trick.""
"Rachel";"Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I’ll see you later."
"Phoebe";"Okay."
"Ross";"Bye."
"Rachel";"Bye. (She gets up to leave but is stopped by Joey)"
"Joey";"Oh hey Rach, listen—Hi!"
"Rachel";"Hi."
"Joey";"Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin’ to my sister and she knowsyou work at"
"Rachel";"No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore"
"Joey";"No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she’sreally interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y’know, togive her some advice."
"Rachel";"I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…"
"Joey";"Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!"
"Rachel";"Really?! Oh my God! I’m successful!"
"Joey";"Okay, so will you meet with her?"
"Rachel";"Yes! I’d love to! Have her come by the office."

"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Joey";"She took ‘em!"

"Ross";"Yeah. Why?"
"Phoebe";"Sting has a son that goes there too!"
"Ross";"Yeah I know; he’s in Ben’s class."
"Phoebe";"You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaurstuff you tell us?!"
"Ross";"Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? (Joey is about tosit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)"
"Phoebe";"Sting’s son, seven years old and there’s a picture."
"Ross";"What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?"
"Phoebe";"No, it’s"
"Ross";"Uh, I actually haven’t even met him."
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concertFriday night, but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and gettickets?! If you get two I’ll take you."
"Ross";"Well actually, I’m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll bethere."
"Phoebe";"There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Stingtomorrow!"
"Monica";"Hey guys!"
"Chandler";"Hey-hey."
"Rachel";"Hi Monica!"
"Monica";"Hey. (Sits down on the arm of the couch.)"
"Rachel";"Hi boots."
"Monica";"See Chandler? I’m getting a lot of use out of them already!They’re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, withpants…"
"Chandler";"You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money topay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)"
"Phoebe";"Wow! They’re beautiful!"
"Rachel";"Ahh…"
"Monica";"(almost crying) They hurt so much!"
"Phoebe";"What?!"
"Monica";"The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!"
"Rachel";"Well-well you can give them to me! I haven’t felt my feet in years!"
"Monica";"I can’t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler thatI’d wear them all the time, I just can’t give them away!"
"Phoebe";"Well then get your money back and return them!"
"Monica";"I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a littlescuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood."
"Ross";"(entering) Hey!"
"Chandler";"(returning to his seat) Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school…"
"Chandler";"(spinning around looking for him) I don’t think you did a verythorough job!"
"Ross";"I dropped him off at Carol’s. (To Phoebe) Anyway, it turns out thatI’m not going to be able to get those tickets though."
"Phoebe";"Oh no! Why not?"
"Ross";"Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along."
"Phoebe";"How come?!"
"Ross";"Apparently, Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms arelesbinims."
"Phoebe";"Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then"
"Ross";"Phoebe, you can’t force kids to be friends."
"Phoebe";"Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!"
"Ross";"Playpen?! Ben’s seven!"
"Phoebe";"Your kid is seven?! (Ross nods, "Yes.") (To the rest)He’s really small. (To Ross) Please! Please get the tickets!"
"Ross";"Look I’m sorry Pheebs, I can’t do it."
"Phoebe";"Yes you can! Sting says so himself!"
"Ross";"What?"
"Phoebe";"(singing)"
"Ross";"Look Phoebe, I’m sorry it’s just…"
"Phoebe";"(singing)"
"Ross";"Phoebe, I…"
"Phoebe";"(singing)"
"Joey";"(entering, with Dina) Here she is! Future fashion superstar!"
"Rachel";"Oh Joey, I’m hardly a…"
"Joey";"My little sister Dina!"
"Rachel";"Right! Hi Dina!"
"Dina";"Hi."
"Rachel";"Nice to meet you. (They shake hands.)"
"Dina";"Thanks so much for meetin’ with me. Joey’s told me so much aboutyou!"
"Joey";"This is so exciting for her. Well, I’ll let you two fash…istsget down to business. (Exits.)"
"Rachel";"Okay. All right Dina, well let’s talk about the different areas offashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see, there’s design, but you mayneed a whole other degree for that. Uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is greatbecause you get to travel…"
"Dina";"I…I don’t care about fashion! I’m pregnant! And I know youare too, so you gotta help me!"
"Rachel";"(stunned) And there’s marketing…"
"Monica";"(standing up) Ahhhhhhhh!"
"Chandler";"(opening the door) What’s wrong?"
"Monica";"Oh nothing I’m just—just was yawning. (Mimics the groan frombefore and stretches.)"
"Chandler";"Oh don’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (They gointo the apartment.)"
"Monica";"Honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?"
"Chandler";"Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you canwear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining."
"Monica";"I-I don’t-I don’t think that I’m gonna wear the bootstonight."
"Chandler";"Why not?"
"Monica";"Well y’know, I’m just-I’m just worried that bosses willsee them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see themand-and want a raise!"
"Chandler";"Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?"
"Monica";"Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and theboots don’t really go with it."
"Chandler";"You said that you paid all that money because those boots go withskirts, dresses, and pants!"
"Monica";"Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I’ll wear the boots. Infact, I’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Monica";"Okay? (She starts to walk which causes her to start crying) Ooo wee!Christmas party in my boots! (Runs into the bedroom and mixes saying ‘ow’ withlaughing.)"
"Dina";"I-I can’t go in there. I can’t tell him!"
"Rachel";"Honey, it’s going to be okay. He’s been incredibly supportiveof me, and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for. (She givesDina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)"
"Dina";"Thank you."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Joey";"Hey! It’s my fashion girls! (They don’t react.) What’swrong?"
"Rachel";"Honey, why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants totell you."
"Joey";"(concerned) Oh. What’s, what’s going on? Is it mom? Is she sick?Is it dad’s heart? Is that a sandwich?"
"Dina";"Joe, mom and dad are fine…"
"Joey";"Is that a sandwich?!"
"Rachel";"Joey…there’s something that you…should know. Dina?"
"Dina";"I’m pregnant."
"Joey";"(angrily) What?!"
"Rachel";"(To Dina) Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! (Shequickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)"
"Joey";"Well obviously this is a mistake! You can’t be pregnant! Because youhave to have sex to get pregnant!"
"Dina";"Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!"
"Rachel";"What?! Dina…"
"Joey";"(to Rachel) Bub!!! (Points at her and quiets Rachel.) (To Dina) Ican’t believe this! You’re the good one! You went to college! Both years! Whodid this to you?!"
"Dina";"Bobby Corso, but he’s a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He’sreal funny."
"Joey";"You got pregnant for funny?! Dina…if he’s funny…"
"Dina";"Why? Where are you going?"
"Joey";"I can’t look at you right now! (Exits and slams the door behind him.)"
"Dina";"Wow."
"Rachel";"I know."
"Phoebe";"Oh, there you are Ben!"
"Ben";"Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?"
"Phoebe";"Well, I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in yourclass. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a littletalk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy’s name is Sting’s son."
"Ben";"Jack? I hate him! He’s a jerk."
"Phoebe";"Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but theyhave famous fathers."
"Ben";"I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there. (Goes over toDoug.)"
"Phoebe";"Him you’re friends with. (Starts looking at the children trying tofind Jack and a teacher notices her.)"
"The Teacher";"Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?"
"Phoebe";"Yes! Yes you can, I’m looking for Jack’s parents."
"The Teacher";"Are you with one of the students?"
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh, I’m with Ben."
"The Teacher";"Are you one of Ben’s mothers?"
"Phoebe";"I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was, it wasdifficult coming out to my parents."
"The Teacher";"Well hi, I’m Jenny Boone. I’m the new teacher here."
"Phoebe";"Oh."
"The Teacher";"I’ve only met your partner Carol."
"Phoebe";"Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan."
"The Teacher";"Right. Are you looking for Jack’s parents to discuss theproblems he’s having with Ben? (Phoebe nods ‘Yes.’) Yeah. Because I reallydo think the parents should sit down and have a conversation."
"Phoebe";"Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down andtalk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?"
"The Teacher";"Oh, their number is on the contact sheet."
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? ‘Cause Carolthrew it out, she lost ours. She’s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece ofass."
"Chandler";"Y’know, that party wasn’t bad."
"Monica";"Yeah! I didn’t know there would be dancing. That was a"
"Chandler";"I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?"
"Monica";"Oh no, we can’t walk!"
"Chandler";"What honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’sgo."
"Monica";"Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climbdown through the manhole cover?"
"Chandler";"What’s going on?"
"Monica";"I can’t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Monica";"Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them!They’re killing me! One toe at a time!"
"Chandler";"So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause)It’s oddly unsettling."
"Monica";"How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?"
"Chandler";"Hop on."
"Monica";"Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots offfirst. (She starts taking them off.) Ah…Ooh…Oohh…Ohh…OhGod…Ohh…Oh…Ohh…Ohhhh…"
"Chandler";"Honey, I know you’re in pain right now, but I’m a littleturned on."
"Dina";"Do you ever worry that you’ll be walking and your baby will just likeslip out?"
"Rachel";"What college was that Dina?"
"Dina";"Oh my God! Bobby!"
"Bobby";"Hi Dina. Good to see you."
"Rachel";"Joey, what are you doing?"
"Joey";"Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to jointhis man and this woman…"
"Rachel";"Oh Joey this is crazy!"
"Joey";"Don’t interrupt me when I’m talkin’ to God! Now where werewe? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man…"
"Dina";"No!"
"Joey";"Oh you’ll take ‘em!"
"Dina";"No I won’t!"
"Joey";"Hey! You don’t get a say in this!"
"Dina";"Yes I do!"
"Joey";"Ahhh! I heard "I do", we’re halfway there! Okay! (To Bobby)You!"
"Rachel";"All right Joey! That is enough! (Grabs him and pulls him away from Bobbyand Dina) Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it’s not legal. Okay?They-they don’t have a marriage license, they don’t have any witnesses, and thegroom only has on one shoe!"
"Bobby";"Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it."
"Joey";"Well what am I supposed to do?"
"Rachel";"You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they canmake their own decisions."
"Joey";"No they can’t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!"
"Rachel";"Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! (To Bobby and Dina)Right?"
"Bobby";"Yeah…we kinda didn’t use any…"
"Rachel";"Oh, come on kids! A little help here!"
"Phoebe";"Wow! This place is incredible! (Gasps) Sting’s pen…that hegave to Phoebe. (Puts the pen in her purse and goes over to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase)Come on! Secret passageway! (Starts pulling books at random as Trudie enters.)"
"Trudie Styler";"Hi! (By the way, it’s actually her.)"
"Phoebe";"Hi!"
"Trudie Styler";"I’m Trudie."
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh."
"Trudie Styler";"You must be Ben’s mum."
"Phoebe";"Why else would I be here?"
"Trudie Styler";"Do sit down."
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh. (They go and sit down.)"
"Trudie Styler";"I gather Jack and Ben haven’t been getting along lately."
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Trudie Styler";"I’m told there are two sides to this story, but allI’ve heard is that Ben’s a bit of a poo-poo head."
"Phoebe";"Umm, I’m sorry. Won’t-won’t Jack’s father be joiningus?"
"Trudie Styler";"Oh I’m sorry, Jack’s father is not available."
"Phoebe";"Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday nightperhaps at 8 o’clock?"
"Trudie Styler";"Oh no, I know that wouldn’t work. My husband’s inconcert."
"Phoebe";"Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you seeI’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during."
"Trudie Styler";"So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now."
"Phoebe";"Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm,all the while thinking about the children of course."
"Trudie Styler";"Are you here for tickets?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, thank you. Four would be great."
"Trudie Styler";"I’m not giving concert tickets to someone who’d usetheir son like this!"
"Phoebe";"Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!"
"Trudie Styler";"(stands up) Look, I’ve just pressed a button, triggering asilent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!"
"Phoebe";"The Police? Here? A reunion?! (She gets out her camera.)"
"Chandler";"Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go."
"Monica";"(notices something in the window) Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!"
"Chandler";"Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?"
"Monica";"My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see theprice?"
"Chandler";"I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband."
"Monica";"Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now.Just-just give me my boots."
"Chandler";"(pause) I don’t have your boots."
"Monica";"Well I don’t have them either. Where are they?"
"Chandler";"Well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew ona bale of hay!"
"Monica";"Okay. (She gets off him.) God well, we gotta go back and get them!"
"Chandler";"Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?"
"Monica";"Okay, I’m never gonna wear them again. I just didn’t get achance to say goodbye."
"Chandler";"Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones."
"Monica";"Okay. (Climbs back on his back.) All right."
"Chandler";"Okay. (Moves closer to the window.)"
"Monica";"(to the boots) Bye boots—Wait! Half off?! (Chandler runs off.)"
"Rachel";"Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t meanthis is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!"
"Joey";"Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let’s hear their plan! Now, what’s thefuture look like for Dina and Bobby?"
"Bobby";"Well…I really have high hopes for my band."
"Joey";"(to Dina) You were right. He is funny."
"Rachel";"Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that youwanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don’t you tell us alittle bit about your band?"
"Bobby";"Well it’s just me and my pal Rooster, the band’s name is NumbNuts."
"Rachel";"(To Dina) Really? (Nods her head at Bobby.)"
"Joey";"Dina, if you’re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is toBobby! (Bobby gets happy.) Dude, that’s not a compliment!"
"Dina";"No Joey! I knew you wouldn’t be supportive!"
"Joey";"So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You’re gonna have thebaby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! You can’t be a singlemother alone! You’re gonna ruin your life!"
"Rachel";"Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?"
"Joey";"No! No! No! It’s different for you. You’re so strong andtogether. You’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing."
"Dina";"Excuse me?"
"Joey";"One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay."
"Rachel";"So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?"
"Joey";"Maybe! (To Bobby) Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does NumbNuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!"
"Dina";"Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it,I’m just gonna need some help. And Bobby’s gonna be here the whole time."
"Bobby";"You bet I am! (To Joey) And to answer your earlier question, we’restraight-up gangster rap. (Joey shakes his head as if he’s about to lose it.)"
"Dina";"Look, Rachel’s told me how much easier you’ve made all this onher. Why can’t you do that for me?"
"Joey";"Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause you’re my baby sister!"
"Dina";"And you’re my big brother! I mean, you’re my favorite guy in thewhole world. I’m not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you."
"Joey";"Well I’d be scared of them, but all right."
"Dina";"Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad atme. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?"
"Joey";"Of course he’s gonna have his Uncle Joey!"
"Dina";"We’re gonna be all right. I mean, even if we’re not married thisbaby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us."
"Joey";"That’s right! By his uncle too!"
"Bobby";"And by you."
"Rachel";"Okay Bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have alittle moment. (Drags Bobby away from Joey and Dina.)"
"Joey";"Come here! (Hugs Dina and Bobby looks to hug Rachel.)"
"Rachel";"No! Seriously! What’s wrong with you?!"
"Ross";"You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! (Holds up two.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!"
"Ross";"Well…let’s just say… (singing)"
"Phoebe";"Oo, where are the seats?"
"Ross";"Uh, middle balcony."
"Phoebe";"Okay, now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away fromSting, his wife, or a member of his family?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"Then that’s not breaking the law! I’m there!"
"Rachel";"Phoebe?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"Look at that guy by the window, wow!"
"Phoebe";"He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And tobe completely honest, he’s not that good in bed."
"Rachel";"Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy Isee—I mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I meannormally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with theway I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack."
"Phoebe";"Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones startgoing crazy."

"Joey";"(To Ross) Congratulations! You just got married!"
"Ross";"I know. Can you believe that?"
"Phoebe";"Wait, I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holidaycard?"

"Monica";"No leg-chewing for us sir."
"Doug";"Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we’ve got a lotto celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?"
"Monica";"I can’t think of anything we’re doing. (Quietly) Whycan’t I think of anything we’re doing?"
"Doug";"Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keepthrowing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!"
"Monica";"Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know,we’re not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.) I-I cannot spend anotherevening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?"
"Chandler";"No."
"Monica";"That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behavedat our engagement party."
"Chandler";"Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts"
"Mona";"Hi!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Mona";"Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card.What do you think?"
"Ross";"Huh. Wow, this is great."
"Mona";"Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?""
"Ross";"Well, we-we haven’t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okayto say it to other people."
"Mona";"How many did you want? I’m getting a hundred."
"Ross";"A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona, uh…I-I’mnot sure about the whole uh, card thing."
"Mona";"Really? Why not?"
"Ross";"Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don’t know ifwe’re really quite there yet."
"Mona";"Oh y’know, I didn’t think of it that way. You’re right.You’re right. So, can I ask you a question?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Mona";"Where are we?"
"Ross";"Huh."
"Mona";"Y’know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?"
"Ross";"Hmm…"
"Mona";"I mean I love spending time with you, y’know I just—I hopewe’re moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don’t youthink?"
"Ross";"Let’s do the card!"
"Mona";"What?"
"Ross";"The card! I think we’re there!"
"Mona";"Okay. I—But I think we should still have this conversation."
"Ross";"Really?! I mean, even with the card?"
"Nurse";"Hi!"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Nurse";"Just so you know, Dr. Long can’t be here today, she was called tothe hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you."
"Rachel";"Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guywho took my blood sample really cute? Y’know who I’m talking about, baldhaircut, hairy fingers… (Stops when she realizes it was her.)"
"Dr. Schiff";"(entering) Hi Rachel? I’m Dr. Schiff. (By the way, he’s anattractive man.)"
"Rachel";"Yes, you are."
"Dr. Schiff";"So, how’s it going?"
"Rachel";"Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where areyou from? What do you do?"
"Dr. Schiff";"I’m a doctor."
"Rachel";"Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do youski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?"
"Dr. Schiff";"Uh, I don’t have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski."
"Rachel";"Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!"
"Dr. Schiff";"So, are you experiencing any discomfort?"
"Rachel";"No. I’m very comfortable."
"Dr. Schiff";"Any painful gas?"
"Rachel";"No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!"
"Dr. Schiff";"Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?"
"Rachel";"Well would you like me to lie down on the table?"
"Dr. Schiff";"I’m sorry, is there something going on here?"
"Rachel";"Do you feel it too?"
"Rachel";"Hi."
"Phoebe";"Oh hey! So, how did your doctor’s appointment go?"
"Rachel";"Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in themiddle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God."
"Monica";"Why did you do that?"
"Phoebe";"Okay, remember that little problem I was having during myfourth month ofpregnancy?"
"Monica";"Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up youpractically came on to me."
"Phoebe";"You wish."
"Monica";"Hey, I could’ve had you if I wanted you."
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah? Come and get it."
"Rachel";"Okay, even this is turning me on!"
"Ross";"(entering) Hey!"
"Rachel";"Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you andMona? Are you guys still together?"
"Ross";"Oh yeah, yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!"
"Monica";"You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?"
"Ross";"Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants tohave the conversation about where the relationship is going."
"Phoebe";"Ugh! Women!"
"Ross";"I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? Imean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?""
"Rachel";"Uh Ross? You asked me that."
"Ross";"Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, Ihate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of agesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talkabout it."
"Monica";"Like asking her to move in with you?"
"Ross";"Smaller than that."
"Monica";"Making her a mixed tape?"
"Ross";"Uh, bigger than that."
"Phoebe";"Give her a key to your apartment."
"Ross";"Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape."
"Monica";"All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I loveyou."
"Ross";"Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but Icould say I looove spending time with you."
"Phoebe";"No, we hate that."
"Monica";"That is a slap in the face."
"Ross";"Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have theconversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.What do you think Rach?"
"Rachel";"I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipplesthrough that sweater."
"Doug";"Bing! We’re all set for tonight, 8 o’clock."
"Chandler";"Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work."
"Doug";"Oh, my ex-wife didn’t work, unless you call turning into her motherwork. Fine. Tomorrow night then."
"Chandler";"Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either."
"Doug";"Oh? Why not?"
"Chandler";"It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament."
"Doug";"What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me orsomething?"
"Chandler";"Well now-now you’re just talking crazy."
"Doug";"So why can’t the three of us go out together?"
"Chandler";"Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Holdme."
"Doug";"Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised,I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked atme, pure lust."
"Chandler";"Y’know what would really help me through this tough time ischoking something. Can I choke ya?"
"Doug";"Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this. Now here’s the plan,grab your coat, we’re going to a strip club."
"Chandler";"Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell withthat bitch."
"Ross";"Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversationabout-about where things are with us."
"Mona";"Yeah, I-I think I suggested that."
"Ross";"Aw, we-we are so…(Motions that they’re connected.) So umm, wellI-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y’know hanging out with you. And I mean-I’mhaving a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides thereisn’t.)"
"Mona";"Okay."
"Ross";"I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-ifit’s just fun. It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? Sowhere-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-andthe answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’rethinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’renot getting any younger. No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you"
"Mona";"I’m sorry, so umm, so where are we?"
"Ross";"Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young."
"Mona";"Okay…"
"Ross";"But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to myapartment. (Hands her his key.)"
"Mona";"Really?!"
"Ross";"Really."
"Mona";"You don’t think this is too fast."
"Rachel";"You gave her a key to your apartment?!"
"Ross";"Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in avery serious relationship."
"Phoebe";"(entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! How’d the conversation go?"

"Phoebe";"It’s okay, he’s a virgin."
"Monica";"Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he’ll havesex with you."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone."
"Rachel";"No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just doit with some random guy!"
"Phoebe";"Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!(Phoebe exits.)"
"Doug";"Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lapdance with those girls. Huh?"
"Chandler";"Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl."
"Doug";"Bing—What’s this?! (Grabs his hand.)"
"Chandler";"It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a"
"Doug";"No, it’s a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We’re gonna goto the East River right now and throw it in there!"
"Chandler";"Oh no-no-no!"
"Doug";"Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y’know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot betterand if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head."

"Mona";"Ohh! (Hugs him.) And I love spending time with you. (Ross isn’thappy.)"
"Chandler";"Hi honey I’m home."
"Monica";"From the tequila factory?"
"Chandler";"It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him thatyou and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and thenwhen I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!"
"Monica";"Come here. I can breath through my mouth."
"Chandler";"Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life wouldbe like without you. It was like"

"Joey";"Oh, what’s wrong?"
"Rachel";"Oh you really, you really just don’t want to hear about it."
"Joey";"Then why did I ask?"
"Rachel";"Okay, it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—butlately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put thisumm, erotically charged."
"Joey";"Is that college talk for horny?"
"Rachel";"Yeah. So y’know, I have all of these feelings and I don’t knowwhat to do about them, because I can’t date like a normal person, which is finebecause I don’t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night.Just sex, y’know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feelcomfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night, I mean isthat really so…hard…to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?"
"Joey";"Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon."
"Rachel";"Well, I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock."

"Joey";"I know!"
"Joey";"Do you wanna do it?"
"Rachel";"No!"
"Joey";"All right, me neither! I was just testing you!"
"Rachel";"That’s the end of this conversation!"
"Joey";"This conversation never happened!"
"Rachel";"Never happened! Good night!"
"Joey";"Good night!"
"Joey";"Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)"
"Phoebe";"Hi. Listen, I’m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It reallywasn’t right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you somethingthat I think you’ll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying theEvander Holyfield cutout.) Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I’m gonna, I’m gonnawant him back. So… (Looks at him longingly) I’m gonna go now. (Exits.)

"Monica";"Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade!This is like—Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!"
"Phoebe";"Oh really? What was your first?"
"Monica";"Well I-I really don’t remember the name of it."

"Phoebe";"Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning."
"Monica";"Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!"
"Chandler";"Who cares? It’s a stupid game."
"Monica";"You only think it’s stupid because you suck at it."
"Chandler";"I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck."
"Phoebe";"Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you,then maybe I should just keep it."

"Chandler";"Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosenup. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirtywords."
"Monica";"Chandler, why would you do that?"
"Chandler";"Because it’s awesome."
"Monica";"You think this is clever?"
"Chandler";"Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S itis a bit of a challenge."
"Monica";"Hey wait a minute, this one isn’t dirty."
"Chandler";"It is when you put it together with that one."
"Monica";"Ah, well if you don’t clear this off, you won’t be getting oneof those from me. But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, thiscan’t be there."
"Chandler";"Come on, he won’t even know what they mean."
"Monica";"Chandler! He’s seven; he’s not stupid."
"Chandler";"Have you talked to him lately?"
"Monica";"All right, look I’m just gonna unplug it."
"Chandler";"No-no-no, if you unplug it, I’ll have nothing to show for my day!It would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look atthat! Look at that, it’s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM(Read Only Memory, it’s a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!"
"Monica";"Honey you-you got to beat your scores!"
"Chandler";"With the claw?!"
"Monica";"All right fine. Fine, I’ll do it. I’ve just got to get thisoff the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger."
"Chandler";"(smiles) Pull my finger—(Looks at his hand)—My hand ismessed up."
"Rachel";"I am not gonna answer that!"
"Joey";"Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross ifyou had to, if you had to, who would you punch?"
"Rachel";"No one! They are my friends, I wouldn’t punch any of them."
"Joey";"Chandler?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, but I don’t know why. Look at me, I’m having such awonderful time!"
"Joey";"Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!"
"Rachel";"I know!"
"Joey";"I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?"
"Rachel";"Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose."
"Joey";"I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date somuch."
"Rachel";"Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before."
"Joey";"Huh. Huh."
"Rachel";"All right, now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my dateleaves, but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan."
"Joey";"Ah! Okay, well then you don’t judge me. I’m gonna suck on thecellophane from the brownie I had before. (They both do as they planned.)"
"Rachel";"So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?"
"Joey";"Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lipslook irresistible."
"Rachel";"How do you do that?"
"Joey";"Now you can’t tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm."
"Rachel";"Oh my God!"
"Joey";"Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I’m telling ya. Okay all right, so nowyou go."
"Rachel";"No, I don’t want to tell you."
"Joey";"Why not?"
"Rachel";"Because it’s embarrassing."
"Joey";"More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! (Rachel just looks athim.) I didn’t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, justtell me!"
"Rachel";"(laughs) Okay. All right, stand up. (They do so.) Well, when we’reat the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for asecond, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesn’t soundlike anything, but I swear it works."
"Joey";"(stunned and turned on) Yeah. Why—Yeah, that would work for ya…"
"Rachel";"All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time."
"Joey";"Oh. (She kisses him.) Yeah. (She goes into her room.) Me to. (He thenstarts to freak out.)"
"Rachel";"…you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!"
"Ross";"No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding thephrase, "Get the hell out of my way!""
"Rachel";"Well, why didn’t you just take a cab?"
"Ross";"Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streetsit’ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I?Rockefeller?"
"Rachel";"Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this."
"Ross";"Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t, they’ll take the class awayfrom me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter."
"Rachel";"You what?"
"Ross";"You’ve seen it, the Geller Yeller."
"Rachel";"Right. Wow!"
"Ross";"Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I’m sure I canmake it this time. I just…I just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit bycars. (He goes to the bathroom as Joey enters.)"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie"
"Joey";"Oh yeah, I still can’t believe you haven’t seen"
"Rachel";"Relax! It’s not like it’s"
"Joey";"Have you ever tried to sit through"
"Rachel";"Yeah I know it’s really boring, but it’s like a big deal.Anyway, I was thinking about renting"
"Joey";"Oh yeah? All right, let’s do it tonight."
"Rachel";"Well don’t you have that big date tonight?"
"Joey";"Oh right!"
"Rachel";"Hey Joey, can I ask you something?"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?"
"Joey";"Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!"
"Rachel";"I don’t know! (Pause) I’m-I’m kinda thinking it-it wasthe lobster…"
"Joey";"Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster."
"Rachel";"Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night."
"Joey";"Yeah me too, all night."
"Rachel";"Really?! How come we didn’t cross paths?"
"Joey";"Yeah well that’s because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah, youdon’t want to look in my hamper."
"Monica";"Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back overhere. All right, come on"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey, you guys. Listen, I’m sorry that I was hogging thegame before—(Sees the top ten list)—Oh my God! Your friends have someunfortunate initials!"
"Monica";"They’re all Chandler."
"Phoebe";"Chandler sucks! He couldn’t have gotten this good!"
"Chandler";"I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price."
"Monica";"But Ben is coming over tonight and he can’t see this."
"Chandler";"Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They bothlook at him.) Was it just me?!"
"Ross";"Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I’m on time! (Grabs a bottle of water from astudent, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) Okay,why don’t we all uh, (Exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. Where… (Exhalesagain) Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots. Okay, (Closes hisbook.) umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while I—(Passes outand collapses.)"
"Joey's Date";"Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted."
"Joey";"No-no! I’m fine. It’s just… Hey, can I ask you something?Have you ever looked at someone that you’ve known for a while and thensuddenly…suddenly see them a different way?"
"Joey's Date";"You mean like from behind?"
"Joey";"Yeah. Yeah, that…that’s exactly it. You’re right. Yeah."
"Joey's Date";"Ew, y’know what? One time I saw this guy from behind and heseemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!"
"Joey";"(deadpan) Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I’m talkingabout."
"Joey's Date";"Totally! Wow! (Pause) Would you excuse me for a sec?"
"Joey";"Oh yeah, sure. (She gets up, walks towards the bathroom, and Joey watchesher go.) Ehhh."
"Monica";"Oh my God Phoebe, you’re on fire!"
"Phoebe";"I know!"
"Chandler";"One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.)"
"Phoebe";"Don’t touch me!!"
"Monica";"Don’t touch her!!"
"Chandler";"All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!"
"Phoebe";"I can’t!! I can’t!! (She dies.) Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of abitch!!!!!"
"Ross";"Phoebe!!"
"Phoebe";"Oh hi Ben—No!! Don’t look at the machine! (Covers the screen.)"
"Rachel";"Oh God! Thank God you’re home! I’m watching"
"Joey";"(incredulous) Alone?!"
"Rachel";"Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!"
"Joey";"Hey, did you get to the part where they’re trapped in the car andCujo’s throwin’ himself at the windshield?"
"Rachel";"No! No! Seriously, what’s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, whatare you doing home so early? What happened to your date?"
"Joey";"Oh uh, it didn’t work out."
"Rachel";"Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?"
"Joey";"Oh uh, okay. Yeah."
"Rachel";"Y’know, I never thought I’d say this about a movie, but Ireally hope this dog dies. (Joey brings over a stool at sits on it next to Rachelwho’s in the big chair.) What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protectme."
"Joey";"Oh sure, yeah, why not? (Sits on the arm of the chair.)"
"Rachel";"Okay. (Pushes play.) Okay, that’s him! That’s him! That’sCujo! That’s Cujo!"
"Joey";"All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it’ll be okay."
"Rachel";"Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now? I can’t watch! (DragsJoey closer to her and cowers into his chest.) Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this?Aren’t you scared?"
"Joey";"Terrified. (But for a totally different reason.)"
"Ross";"So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now,the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. (He moves to the map and wesee why he made it to class on time, he’s wearing in-line skates and hasn’ttaken them off.) Here. (Points to the map, somewhere in the Middle East, then spins on theskates and points to the map.) Here. (China.) Now as for the hydrosaurs…"
"Joey";"(thinking)"
"Rachel";"(coming from her room) Hi, sweetie."
"Joey";"(thinking)"
"Monica";"(airily) Hi."
"Chandler";"Are you, are you high?"
"Monica";"I just had the most amazing bath."
"Chandler";"Really? I don’t like baths."
"Monica";"Wait, you like them with me."
"Chandler";"Honey, it’s not the bath I enjoy, it’s the wet, naked lady."
"Monica";"Oh, baths are so relaxing!"
"Chandler";"Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth."
"Monica";"How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candlesand some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away."
"Chandler";"Honey, it’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and I’m watching"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you."
"Chandler";"Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?"
"Joey";"Well, neither."
"Chandler";"Oh my God, what’s up?!"
"Joey";"I don’t know. It’s-it’s just…lately, I’ve beenfeeling… Okay, here’s what it is… (Pause) You know what? I feel a lotbetter, thanks! (Starts to leave)"
"Chandler";"Oh no-no, no you don’t, just come back."
"Joey";"All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there arerules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that’s different. I mean, there arerules there, too! You know what I mean?"
"Chandler";"Do you?"
"Joey";"It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the sameplace, right?"
"Chandler";"In London?"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London."
"Joey";"You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me afavor, this conversation was between you and me."
"Chandler";"If that."
"Rachel";"Hi! Oh, Ross, don’t forget, we have that doctor’s appointmenttomorrow!"
"Ross";"Right."
"Phoebe";"Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?"
"Ross";"No-no, we talked about it. We don’t want to know. All we care about isthat it’s happy and healthy."
"Rachel";"Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!"
"Ross";"And smart!"
"Rachel";"Popular."
"Ross";"With an aptitude for science."
"Phoebe";"Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinkingof names yet?"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!"
"Ross";"Really? Me too!"
"Phoebe";"Me too!"
"Rachel";"Really?!"
"Phoebe";"Uh huh! If it’s a girl, Phoebe, and if it’s a boy, Phoebo!"
"Ross";"Maybe. But it wouldn’t hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach,what were you thinking? (Gives her a look)"
"Rachel";"Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl, how about Sandrine? It’sFrench."
"Ross";"Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent."
"Rachel";"Okay fine, what do you have?"
"Ross";"Well, OK, it’s for a boy. Well, I know it’s a little out there,but…Darwin."
"Rachel";"Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, by Sandrine."
"Ross";"You’re just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!"
"Rachel";"I’m really, really not."
"Phoebe";"How-how about you each get five vetoes?"
"Ross";"All right."
"Rachel";"All right."
"Ross";"That sounds fair."
"Rachel";"Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay, checkthis out. If it’s a girl, Rain."
"Ross";"Veto."
"Rachel";"Why?"
"Ross";"Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made outof wheat."
"Phoebe";"I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!"
"Ross";"Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?"
"Rachel";"Ross, why do you hate our child?"
"Ross";"Fine, you go."
"Rachel";"Okay, James."
"Ross";"Huh."
"Rachel";"But only if it’s a girl."
"Ross";"Oh, veto. How about—Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?"
"Rachel";"Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?"
"Ross";"Veto. Stewart?"
"Rachel";"Veto. Sawyer?"
"Ross";"Veto. Helen?"
"Rachel";"Veto."
"Phoebe";"Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?"
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Monica";"Boy, do I have a surprise for you!"
"Chandler";"Sex on the balcony?"
"Monica";"No, but someone’s really not going to get over that idea, are they?"
"Chandler";"What is it?"
"Monica";"I drew you a bath!"
"Chandler";"Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us havingsex on the balcony?"
"Monica";"Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff!I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And gotyou this little plastic Navy ship. So it’s a boy bath!"
"Chandler";"Well, this does butch it up a bit."
"Monica";"I swear, if you try it, you will love it!"
"Chandler";"All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?"
"Monica";"Absolutely."
"Monica";"Bet I know how"
"Chandler";"(thinking)"
"Monica";"(entering) So?"
"Chandler";"Oh my God."
"Monica";"I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give youa facial!"
"Chandler";"I’m going to need a bigger boat."
"Ross";"I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on,little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?"
"Rachel";"Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!"
"Dr. Long";"Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowingthe sex of the baby?"
"Ross";"Uh, no. No, we’re not."
"Rachel";"But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whetherit’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?"
"Dr. Long";"That’s right. But if you don’t want to know…"
"Ross";"No, no, we want to wait, right?"
"Rachel";"Right. Right."
"Dr. Long";"(looks at her beeping pager) Oh, I’ll be right back. And, uh, I knowit’s really not my place, but please don’t name your child Phoebo."
"Rachel";"(looking at the bulletin board with baby pictures) So, which of thesebabies do you think is the ugliest?"
"Ross";"What? Rach! Come on, that’s terrible!They’re…uh…they’re babies. They’re-they’re all beautiful."
"Rachel";"Third one from the left?"
"Ross";"Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I’m talking about it.(Rachel starts to peek at the file) Don’t-don’t you—Wh—Wha—Hey!!"
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Ross";"You’re looking!"
"Rachel";"I didn’t!"
"Ross";"I saw you!"
"Rachel";"Okay fine, I did. But I didn’t see anything, I swear."
"Ross";"Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!"
"Rachel";"Okay, but Ross just listen to me…"
"Ross";"No, no, no, no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!"
"Rachel";"But I couldn’t even if I wanted to, because I don’t know! Iswear; I didn’t see anything, and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentarylapse."
"Ross";"Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?"
"Rachel";"(holding stomach) Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross."
"Monica";"Hello?"
"Chandler";"I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’ssomething wrong."
"Monica";"You know what? I-I think I’ll wait out here."
"Chandler";"I’m in the bathtub."
"Monica";"Oh. (She goes into the bathroom.) What’s wrong?"
"Chandler";"I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The saltdidn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’tcompliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!"
"Monica";"What?"
"Chandler";"The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different.(Pause) It’s interesting."
"Monica";"Okay, let’s talk about something else."
"Chandler";"Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!"
"Monica";"Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talkingabout rules and right and wrong and…"
"Chandler";"I had the exact same conversation."
"Monica";"You did? What was he talking about?"
"Chandler";"I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting outwords since we saw him in"
"Monica";"(groans) That was a long night."
"Chandler";"All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?"
"Monica";"Okay, he was talking about rules."
"Chandler";"Uh-huh."
"Monica";"Umm, and looking at people differently."
"Chandler";"He didn’t say anything about that to me."
"Monica";"What did he tell you?"
"Chandler";"He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, ofcourse the glue that holds this all together, the rules."
"Monica";"Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wantsto do what you and I did in London with someone."
"Chandler";"But what did he mean by rules?"
"Monica";"Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!"
"Chandler";"Because he was looking at her differently."
"Monica";"And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!"
"Chandler";"My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!"
"Phoebe";"(from outside the bathroom) You guys?"
"Monica";"Just a minute! (To Chandler) That’s Mrs. Tribbiani!"
"Chandler";"You don’t say anything."
"Monica";"Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start thegreatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could allstart having babies?"
"Chandler";"I’m not going to let you say anything."
"Monica";"You just stay here! (Dumps a jar of bath salts in the bathtub)"
"Chandler";"Oh, God!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron."
"Monica";"Oh, you had that?"
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh."
"Monica";"I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago."
"Phoebe";"Oh, just as well, I broke this one."
"Phoebe";"What?"
"Monica";"Nothing."
"Phoebe";"Okay."
"Monica";"I mean, I-I, I really shouldn’t say. I mean, I’m really notsupposed to."
"Phoebe";"Fine."
"Monica";"It’s a humdinger!"
"Phoebe";"Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me."
"Monica";"Somebody likes you!"
"Phoebe";"(Groans) Is it Chandler?"
"Monica";"No!"
"Phoebe";"Well, then tell him to stop staring!"
"Monica";"It’s Joey!"
"Phoebe";"Really?! Joey?! You don’t say."
"Monica";"Is it something you’d be interested in?"
"Phoebe";"I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean,on the one hand, Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No, Ican’t. We’re friends. No, oh, no. I don’t want to risk what we have."
"Monica";"I guess that makes sense. So, you think you’re going to talk to him?"
"Phoebe";"Sure, yeah. I mean, it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt.Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!"
"Monica";"Not Chandler, just Joey."
"Phoebe";"Sure."
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Ross";"Hey."
"Rachel";"You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really comingaround on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that."
"Ross";"Rach, I-I can’t tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh… Wait aminute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind?Unless, you know we’re never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. Youknow it’s a boy!"
"Rachel";"I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name."
"Ross";"I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get toname it when it’s a boy, and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heathor Blaine or Sequoia."
"Rachel";"I would—Sequoia?"
"Ross";"Veto."
"Rachel";"Fine."
"Ross";"Unless… (Rachel groans.)"
"Rachel";"But Ross, you want the name Ruth!"
"Ross";"Not like this!"
"Phoebe";"Hey."
"Joey";"Hey. Well, what’s up?"
"Phoebe";"Umm, Joey, I know."
"Joey";"What?"
"Phoebe";"I knooow."
"Joey";"Whaaat?"
"Phoebe";"I know about your feelings."
"Joey";"Oh my God. You do?"
"Phoebe";"Yes, and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler andMonica, but that’s very rare."
"Joey";"I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for thoseguys. I mean, it’s Rachel for God sakes."
"Phoebe";"For God sakes, it’s Rachel!"
"Joey";"I know. I know. And she’s not only my friend; she’s my pregnantfriend! She’s my pregnant friend who’s Ross’ ex!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah that’s Rachel. (To herself) Beat me over the head with it."
"Joey";"What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid ofthese feelings, y’know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything Idon’t like about her. You want to hear it?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Joey";"She made me switch to light Mayo. That’s it! That’s all I got! And,you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!"
"Phoebe";"Joey, I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This isprobably just a crush."
"Joey";"You think?"
"Phoebe";"Absolutely! Y’know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goesaway."
"Joey";"Yeah, just a crush! That’s all this is! It’s a crush! I’mJoey; I don’t get deep feelings."
"Phoebe";"That’s right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I knowI’ve had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I’m sureyou’ve had them for us."
"Joey";"Not really."
"Phoebe";"Mm-hmm. (To herself) Throw me a bone here."
"Ross";"So, I uh… I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Ross";"That’s right. The student has become the master."
"Rachel";"Ross, I swear, I don’t know."
"Ross";"Oh, come on, you know it’s a girl!"
"Rachel";"A what?!"
"Ross";"You really didn’t know?"
"Rachel";"We’re having a girl?"
"Ross";"No."
"Rachel";"That’s what you just said!"
"Ross";"No."
"Rachel";"You said girl!"
"Ross";"Yes. I’m… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry."
"Rachel";"I’m not! We’re having a girl! Sometimes I can’t believeit’s with you—But still! We’re having a girl!"
"Ross";"I know! I know. You know what? I’m putting Ruth back on the table!"
"Rachel";"Oh, yes! We’ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth…"
"Ross";"Permission to veto."
"Rachel";"Yes, please."
"Monica";"Hey."
"Chandler";"Do I smell essential oils?"
"Monica";"Yeah, I’m going to take a bath. I’m just going to get a magazine."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"Monica";"What do you think you’re doing?"
"Chandler";"L-leaving my troubles behind?"
"Monica";"I know that you’re new at this, but this is completely unacceptablebath decorum."
"Chandler";"Oh, it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed."
"Monica";"Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you’rejust a girl in a tub!"
"Chandler";"(upset) Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you knowhow it went with Joey."
"Chandler";"(To Monica) You told her?!"
"Monica";"She pulled it out of me! She’s like a conversational wizard!How’d it go?"
"Phoebe";"Well, you were wrong, he doesn’t like me!"
"Monica";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house andtold you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn’tlike you? How would you feel?"
"Monica";"(Pause)"
"Phoebe";"Really? Lee Majors is hot!"
"Joey";"(from outside the bathroom) Hello?"
"Phoebe";"We’re in the bathroom!"
"Joey";"Why?"
"Chandler";"(sarcastically) Because it’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!"
"Joey";"(entering the bathroom) What are you guys doing in here?"
"Monica";"Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong.It’s Rachel!"
"Chandler";"You like Rachel?!"
"Joey";"It’s no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It’s just acrush! It’s going to go away! (Looks down) Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles!Oh!"
"Phoebe";"(checking for herself) (To Monica) Mazel tov."
"Rachel";"(entering) Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing inhere? (Looks at Chandler) Oh, my! (Covers the spot where Joey wants bubbles to bereplaced.)"
"Monica";"Honey, cover it up with the boat!"
"Ross";"(from outside the bathroom) Hello?"

"Ross";"(entering) Well hey! What’s going on? Ooh, cool boat—(Sees why theboat’s there)—Oh, no. (Averts his eyes by looking around the room) (To Rachel)Hey, did you, did you tell them?"

"Chandler";"Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good."
"Monica";"I’m not touching you."
"Chandler";"You’re not?"
"Monica";"It’s the salts."
"Chandler";"Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!"
"Monica";"(To herself) Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!"
"Monica";"(opens the door wearing a robe, but leaves the chain on) Hey,what’s up?"
"Phoebe";"Well, I left my guitar here again."
"Monica";"Oh, okay. No problem."

"Phoebe";"Oh are you and Chandler…"
"Monica";"Yes! Exactly."
"Phoebe";"Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?"
"Monica";"(laughs) No. (Closes the door as Chandler walks up.)"
"Chandler";"Hey Pheebs, what’s up?"
"Phoebe";"You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! You’re getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!"
"Monica";"Phoebe, I can explain!"

"Chandler";"Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning…"
"Phoebe";"I can’t believe this! How long as this been going on?"
"Monica";"Well umm, Alexandra has been…"

"Rachel";"Oh Joey, I’m so happy things worked out for us that we’rehaving this baby together. I love you so much."
"Joey";"Oh, I love you too."
"Rachel";"And I hope it’s not an inappropriate time to say this but,you’re the best sex I ever had."
"Joey";"That’s always appropriate! (Back to the matter at hand) Oh, okay. Onemore push! One more push!"
"Doctor";"Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations!"
"Ross";"(crying) I hope you’re a better father than you’re a friend!!(Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)"

"Rachel";"Come feel this! Come feel my belly!"
"Joey";"Aaaah…"
"Rachel";"Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feelthis?!"
"Joey";"Really?!"
"Rachel";"Yes!"
"Joey";"Oh, y’know what? Maybe uh, you…you should come to me. I’m anot, I’m not wearing any bottoms."

"Joey";"Oh my, oh my God!"
"Rachel";"Aw, it’s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she’slike umm…oh…who’s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?"
"Joey";"Mia Hamm?"

"Joey";"Oh that’s amazing. (Drops the sheet.)"
"Rachel";"(looking down) Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!"
"Joey";"Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!"
"Chandler";"Hey babe."
"Monica";"Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; theydon’t like us do they? (They gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.)"
"Chandler";"Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks?Maybe we can take it back?"
"Monica";"No, it doesn’t say where it came from. Where would we return it?"
"Chandler";"How about to the street say from the balcony?"
"Monica";"Why don’t we just find a place for it?"
"Chandler";"Okay. How about in that cabinet?"
"Monica";"No! That’s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completelyforgotten everything you learned at orientation?"
"Chandler";"How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by thebathroom.)"
"Monica";"Oh, okay. Here, why don’t you let me do it?"
"Chandler";"Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down andrelax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.)It’s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?"
"Monica";"No reason. I-I keep private things in there."
"Chandler";"Oh y’know, I’ve been living here a while and I’ve neverseen what’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?"
"Monica";"Feminine stuff."
"Chandler";"Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!"
"Monica";"Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love meyou-you’ll let it go."
"Chandler";"Fine."
"Monica";"Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.)"
"Chandler";"(walking casually away) Love you."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!"
"Chandler";"Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for likethree years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said,"If it helps!" (Goes to the bedroom.)"
"Phoebe";"Why won’t you let me massage you?"
"Monica";"Well it’s…I mean I’d just—I’d beself-conscious. You’re my friend; I’d be naked."
"Phoebe";"Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!"
"Monica";"That’s different, we were roommates! And when?!"
"Phoebe";"I’m curious about the human body."
"Monica";"Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me."
"Phoebe";"But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look, ifyou’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?"
"Monica";"Okay, if it means that much to you…"
"Phoebe";"It does! How would you feel if you couldn’t share your cooking?Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn’t teach us about dragons."
"Monica";"Dinosaurs."
"Phoebe";"Potato, potaato."
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey Ross! The baby’s kicking!"
"Ross";"What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs intotrouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabsRachel’s belly.)"
"Rachel";"It’s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do(Mimics him) that again."
"Ross";"Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?"
"Rachel";"Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he wassleeping…"
"Joey";"A dreamless sleep."
"Ross";"My God, the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kindawish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know."
"Joey";"Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel."
"Ross";"Look, I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here.Here’s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it!I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all youwant is ice cream."
"Joey";"Wow! Can I get a copy of that?"
"Phoebe";"(calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?"
"Monica";"Yes."
"Phoebe";"(in a soothing voice) Great, let’s begin. (She starts the massage.)How’s the pressure?"
"Monica";"Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!"
"Phoebe";"Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it’s not weird is it."
"Monica";"No. Ooohh…"
"Phoebe";"That’s right, you just enjoy."
"Monica";"(in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!"
"Phoebe";"(getting uncomfortable) Okay."
"Monica";"Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh that’s it! That’sit! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-ooooh… (Covers bothears and continues the massage with her elbows.)"
"Chandler";"I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I wasn’t trying to openyour closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)"
"Joey";"Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?"
"Chandler";"Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’sin it."
"Joey";"Why not?"
"Chandler";"I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that Ican’t see?!"
"Joey";"I don’t know. Ooh, I bet it’s Richard."
"Chandler";"Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?"
"Joey";"Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she’s having her cake andeating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!"
"Chandler";"And here we go…"
"Joey";"I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what wasbehind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugscame pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y’know it wouldn’t kill ya torespect your wife’s privacy! (He walks away and into his apartment and looks thedoor.) Stupid closet full of bugs!"
"Rachel";"Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. Idon’t—Whoa!! (Winces in pain.)"
"Joey";"Oh hey whoa-whoa, don’t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnantthey got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing."
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Joey";"Absolutely."
"Rachel";"Okay. Oh God—Ow!—Oo!"
"Joey";"Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything’s gonna befine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. (Rachel grabs his hand.) Oww crushingbones!"
"Joey";"Hey! So?"
"Dr. Long";"She’s fine. She’s experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions,mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall."
"Rachel";"Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxtonthingies?"
"Joey";"So but everything is normal."
"Dr. Long";"Absolutely."
"Joey";"And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?"
"Dr. Long";"No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you don’t know what theyare, but she’s fine."
"Rachel";"Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being sonice and calm."
"Joey";"Calm?! I wasn’t calm! I’ve never been more scared in all mylife!"
"Rachel";"But wait you said everything was gonna be okay."
"Joey";"Well what do I know?! I’m not a doctor!"
"Rachel";"But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!"
"Joey";"You sure?!"
"Rachel";"Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterusthough. Mild discomfort, what’s he talking about?"
"Joey";"(seeing Ross) Oh hey-hey!"
"Ross";"(rushes in) Is everything okay?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, everything’s fine!"
"Ross";"Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?"
"Joey";"Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions."
"Ross";"Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don’t even feel them."
"Rachel";"Okay, no uterus, no opinion."
"Joey";"Hey uh, what’s with the candy?"
"Ross";"Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movietheater."
"Rachel";"Oh you went to the movies by yourself?"
"Ross";"No I—Mona!"
"Rachel";"Oh, I gotta go back in there."
"Ross";"What? Why? What’s wrong?"
"Rachel";"No, everything’s fine. I just gotta go back…"
"Ross";"No really, you tell me what’s up."
"Rachel";"I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.)"
"Ross";"(To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital."
"Joey";"Oh hey, don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it, no bigdeal."
"Ross";"Yeah but still, I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad."
"Dr. Long";"(To Joey) Uh, if you have any questions, here’s some informationon Braxton-Hicks. (Hands Joey a pamphlet.) Oh and by the way, you did the right thing bybringing her in. You’re gonna make a wonderful father."
"Joey";"Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) Hebrought"
"Chandler";"There has"
"Joey";"Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?"
"Chandler";"Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, I’m not an nine-year-oldgirl."
"Joey";"Then why do you throw like one?"
"Chandler";"Maybe Monica has a bobby pin."
"Joey";"Sure. "Monica.""
"Chandler";"So, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?"
"Joey";"Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself anyday now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure foundthat quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I just—I wish I didn’t feel this wayabout Rachel anymore, y’know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I loveliving with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think…Ithink Ross feels left out. Y’know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, thedoctor thought I was the father. God… You should’ve seen the look on Ross’sface. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what I’m doing here. For all I know I’mjust locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?"
"Chandler";"That’s a good idea."
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh,Ross is kinda bummed huh?"
"Joey";"Oh, I just…I feel terrible."
"Chandler";"Well, it’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her tothe hospital? Y’know? You’re doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboringan all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind thedoor.) Richard? If-if you’re in there, could you pass me my credit card?"
"Monica";"Hey."
"Phoebe";"Hey."
"Monica";"I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!"
"Phoebe";"No-no, I got that."
"Monica";"So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?"
"Phoebe";"Okay. Okay but you should know though, I’ve raised my rates to $200an hour."
"Monica";"Okay."
"Phoebe";"I mean $500."
"Monica";"What?"
"Phoebe";"600."
"Monica";"What’s going on?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!"
"Monica";"What? (Laughs.)"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried tohurt you and it just spurred you on."
"Monica";"What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises Imake!"
"Phoebe";"Really? There’s nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God!Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?!(Pause) I mean hi."
"Monica";"Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I’m never gonna getmassaged again!"
"Phoebe";"No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, Ihave, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!"
"Monica";"Really?!"
"Phoebe";"Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again.Come back and-and we’ll work through it."
"Monica";"Are you sure?"
"Phoebe";"Yes."
"Monica";"I guess."
"Phoebe";"Great! Okay, if you’ll just excuse me. (To the guy) So, did youhear something you liked?"
"Rachel";"Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!"
"Ross";"Hey uh, I brought you some lunch."
"Rachel";"Ohh! That’s so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of thesandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?"
"Ross";"Well yeah!"
"Rachel";"Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)"
"Ross";"What?! What?! Rach what?!"
"Joey";"What’s going on?"
"Ross";"I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles."
"Joey";"Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad."
"Ross";"(to Rachel) I-I’m sorry Rach, I didn’t know. Are you gonna beokay?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure thatsandwich is gone when I get out there?"
"Joey";"I’m on it! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich.)"
"Ross";"I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throwup!"
"Joey";"Dude relax! It could happen to anyone."
"Ross";"Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of itand I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know."
"Rachel";"(entering) Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna."
"Joey";"Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"What’s up?"
"Joey";"Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation."
"Rachel";"(Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?"
"Joey";"The thing is…’cause I live with Rachel I’m here for a lotof the stuff, okay? (To Rachel) And Ross…Ross is missing everything. So…"
"Rachel";"Yeah?"
"Joey";"Maybe you two should live together."
"Rachel";"Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?"
"Joey";"Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that…ifyou’re gonna have a roommate, y’know it might as well be the father."
"Rachel";"But Joey, I don’t think Ross wants me to move into his apartmentand disrupt his life like that. I mean—(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)—Orhe does."
"Ross";"No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can justtry it like on a temporary basis."
"Rachel";"But Ross, its you and me!"
"Ross";"So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. AndI’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hourago! What is wrong with me?!"
"Joey";"All right now, so? What do you think?"
"Rachel";"I don’t know. Is it crazy?"
"Ross";"No! No it’s not. Joey, this is a smart idea."
"Joey";"Well, I was due."
"Rachel";"Okay, let’s do it. I’ll move in."
"Ross";"Really?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Oh Rach that’s great. That’s great. (They hug and Joey breathesa sigh of relief.)"
"Chandler";"Not to shabby, I got this all off myself…using my wife’stools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what’s behind thegreen door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my God!"
"Monica";"(entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!"
"Chandler";"(laughs) You’re messy."
"Monica";"Oh no! You weren’t supposed to see this!"
"Chandler";"I married Fred Sanford!"
"Monica";"No Chandler, you don’t understand! (Chandler starts singing thetheme for"
"Chandler";"No, honey you’re not sick! Look, I don’t love you becauseyou’re organized, I love you in spite of that."
"Monica";"Really? You promise you won’t tell anyone?"
"Chandler";"Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying aroundcan we, can we share the closet."
"Monica";"Well…it’s just umm…I’m afraid you might mess it up."
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Joey";"Hey."
"Chandler";"So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?"
"Joey";"Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those becauseRachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juicewith calcium though. And uh, it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date, soit’s got a bit of a kick."
"Chandler";"Are you okay?"
"Joey";"Are you kidding me? I’m great! Yeah, I’m uh; I’m betterthan great. I am good. And now that she’s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuffaround here that I couldn’t do before. Y’know? Like umm, I can walk around nakedagain. Y’know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, thisis good for me. Y’know? I like being on my own, I’m uh, better off this way.I’m uh, a lone wolf. Y’know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What’s awolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)"
"Monica";"Ohhh."
"Phoebe";"That’s it. Just relax."
"Monica";"Ohh. Oh! Ohh!"
"Phoebe";"Come on more!"
"Monica";"Oh God!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, you like that don’t you?"
"Monica";"Oh yeah right there!"
"Phoebe";"You want it there? You take it there baby!"
"Monica";"Uh Phoebe?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, say my name. Say it! (She stops when she realizes what she’sdoing.) And now I’m going to cover you back up, and umm we’re never doing thisagain."

"Phoebe";"(sighs) Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this.Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?"
"Joey";"Thanks. But maybe later."
"Phoebe";"Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?"
"Gunther";"(to Joey) You want anything?"
"Joey";"You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman Ilove on Valentine’s Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one momentof relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that’s never going to happen!"
"Gunther";"We have red bagels."
"Joey";"Oh, okay."
"Phoebe";"So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?"
"Ross";"Oh, I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she’s beenaway all week visiting her parents, but she’ll be cool. I mean, she’s been sosupportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, ‘Fossils are myfriends.’"
"Phoebe";"Ugh. Come on, Mona, don’t kiss ass."
"Ross";"Uh, I’m going to take off."
"Phoebe";"All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!"
"Ross";"What is it?"
"Phoebe";"It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it backto your apartment?"
"Ross";"All right. (reading the label) ‘Candy and Cookie?’"
"Phoebe";"Yeah. Candy’s the mother, Cookie’s the daughter. Thefather’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?"
"Monica";"(entering with something behind her back) Phoebe, c’mere. I want toshow you something in the bathroom."
"Phoebe";"Oh, Monica, grow up!"
"Ross";"Hey, what’s behind your back?"
"Monica";"Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe’s opinion on forValentine’s Day."
"Ross";"You don’t want my opinion?"
"Monica";"Not really."
"Ross";"Come on, I’m your older brother, ask me!"
"Monica";"All right, big brother. (holds up two erm…revealing articles ofclothing) Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so yourbest friend would want to do her?"
"Ross";"(quietly) The red one."
"Phoebe";"(knocking and entering) Hey. Look, I know you’ve been really depressedlately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real,live, furry playmate."
"Joey";"No, I’m not sleeping with your friend Jane again."
"Phoebe";"He-hee!"
"Joey";"Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane."
"Phoebe";"This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!"
"Joey";"Thanks so much, Pheebs! (to the dog) We are going to have so much fun, yes weare! (the dog sticks his head between Joey’s legs) Oh! Not that kind of fun."
"Chandler";"Happy Valentine’s!"
"Monica";"(from her bedroom) Okay! I’ll be right out. I’m slipping intosomething a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty."
"Chandler";"(picking up a video from the table) ‘Candy and Cookie’.‘Candy and Cookie?’ Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really mustlove me!! (Chandler runs over to the TV, puts the tape in, and sits down to enjoy some"porn")"
"Man on TV";"Yeah, just relax."
"Chandler";"I love you, St. Valentine."
"Chandler";"Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!"
"Man on TV";"Now, push!"
"Woman on TV";"Ow! Ow! Ooh! That hurts!"
"Chandler";"Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! (Chandler starts to press buttons onthe remote control, frantically.)"
"Woman on TV";"Ohhh! Make it stop!"
"Chandler";"I am trying!"
"Joey";"Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! (Joey pretends to throw it,but really doesn’t, and the dog goes running off.) Well, you’re cute, butyou’re not too smart!"
"Joey";"(looking at the ball the dog brought back) Did I just throw this?"
"Rachel";"(entering) Hi."
"Joey";"Hi."
"Rachel";"I accidentally packed these with my stuff. (looks at the dog and gasps) Whois this?"
"Joey";"Oh, that’s, uh, that’s Phoebe’s friend’s dog. Idon’t know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella."
"Rachel";"(talking with a higher voice, and puckered lips…kind of like you do toa baby or...well…a puppy…it’s hard to explain. Just use your imagination!)Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I’ve got to go towork! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do.(still talking like that) Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can’t stop it. (exits)"
"Joey";"(to the dog) C’mere. Hey. C’mere. That’s Rachel. She’sthe one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you—we love her. But wecan’t have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You’re aguy. (thinks about it and picks up the dog and looks) Well, you used to be."
"Monica";"(entering from her bedroom) So what do you think? (referring to her outfit)"
"Monica";"(to herself) I’ve still got it!"
"Chandler";"(pointing at the video) Why did you get me this?"
"Monica";"What is it?"
"Chandler";"It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh, the dilating…"
"Monica";"Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe’s.Why were you even watching it?"
"Chandler";"I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day."
"Monica";"Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine’sDay… (pulls a video out of a basket) you were right! Apparently, it’s about ayoung girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up havingsex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! (looks closer) Oh, wait a minute. Thosearen’t stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?"
"Chandler";"Well, I’m not really in a sexy mood right now."
"Monica";"Honey, what’s going on?"
"Chandler";"Well, remember the first time we saw"
"Monica";"Mm-hmm."
"Chandler";"How long it took to go back in the water?"
"Monica";"Chandler, we can’t let this tape wreck Valentine’s Day!"
"Chandler";"You don’t know. You didn’t see it."
"Monica";"Child-birth, it’s a natural thing! It’s beautiful."
"Chandler";"Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? (picks upthe remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks likehe’s going to throw up!)"
"Monica";"Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!"
"Chandler";"See, honey, there’s—(puts his hand on her leg)"
"Monica";"Don’t touch me!"
"Mona";"Hi!"
"Ross";"Hey! (they hug) So, how was Atlantic City?"
"Mona";"Good."
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Mona";"I brought you back a present."
"Ross";"Wha—? Oh, come on. You didn’t have to—saltwater taffy?! (Monalaughs) Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with seawater, but it’s actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That’s notinteresting."
"Mona";"I think it’s interesting."
"Ross";"I do too! I missed you!"
"Mona";"I missed you, too! So, how was your week?"
"Ross";"Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!"
"Mona";"How exciting!"
"Ross";"Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t aroundwhen it happened for the first time."
"Mona";"Oh no."
"Ross";"Yeah, I’m missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggestedRachel move in with me."
"Mona";"(laughing) Yeah right!"
"Ross";"What?"
"Mona";"Joey cracks me up! It’s like, ‘Yeah, why don’t you have yourex-wife move in with you? That wouldn’t be awkward at all!’ (she laughs again)"
"Ross";"(not amused) Huh…uh-huh."
"Mona";"Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and myboyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant! (Mona laughs…yes…again!)"
"Mona";"So, what’d you tell him?"
"Ross";"(with his mouth full) Just a second! (he fake laughs, but turns his head andstarts to break down)"
"Phoebe";"How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?"
"Ross";"I don’t know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus,she, uh, she got me taffy!"
"Phoebe";"Taffy, really? I’ve never had any."
"Ross";"Ever?!"
"Phoebe";"Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to providesaltwater treats. (Ross hands her one) Thank you! So what, you’re just never going totell her?"
"Ross";"Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know,I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romanticstuff, and then, just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world, thenI’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me."
"Phoebe";"If I haven’t said it before: she’s a lucky, lucky lady! So, whereare you going to—what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? (Referring to thetaffy, which she’s been chewing this whole time.) Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food?What’s the deal? (she swallows it, finally) Oh, it’s nice! May I try a pink one?"
"Joey";"So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it justisn’t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey."
"Phoebe";"Hey, buddy. How’s my favorite dog, huh? How’s my favorite dog?(the dog doesn’t move) You’re subdued. (to Joey) Did you give him a beer?"
"Joey";"No."
"Phoebe";"Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment."
"Joey";"Yeah, sure. Go ahead. (pause) Oh, me, right!"
"Phoebe";"He’s miserable! What happened to him?"
"Joey";"Nothing. We just talked about stuff."
"Phoebe";"What stuff?"
"Joey";"Rachel stuff."
"Phoebe";"Oh…Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world,and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!"
"Joey";"He’s breathing!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s."
"Joey";"No, no, no, no! He’s fine! Look, look, look! (picks up the ball)Here’s your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! (he throws the ball and it bouncesright next to the dog) Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke thedog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!"
"Ross";"Well, I’m, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?"
"Rachel";"Oh, I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese foodon the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!"
"Ross";"Y’know, it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made withseawater, when in fact—"
"Rachel";"Ross, we actually watched the documentary together."
"Rachel";"Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get hermoney)"
"Ross";"(opening the door to see Mona standing there) Mona? What are—hi! Whatare you doing here? I’m, um, supposed to pick you up!"
"Mona";"Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine’s dinner! Surprise!"
"Ross";"(he makes some really weird noise hear that sounds kind oflike…)Ayyyayyyy!"
"Rachel";"(entering) Oh, hey, Mona!"
"Mona";"Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel! (to Ross) What’s she doing here?"
"Ross";"I have no idea!"
"Rachel";"I’ll be watching TV if anybody needs me. (exits to her room)"
"Mona";"Seriously, what is she doing?"
"Ross";"Uh…lately, she just likes hanging out here."
"Mona";"Why?"
"Ross";"I think she’s lonely."
"Mona";"Okay, but it’s Valentine’s Day!"
"Ross";"I know."
"Mona";"Can’t we just ask her to go?"
"Ross";"No, no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy."
"Rachel";"I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!"
"Mona";"Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?"
"Ross";"Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional, but, but ballsy."
"Rachel";"You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats, andeat this in bed! (exits)"
"Ross";"And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don’t you, uh,open the champagne, and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you."
"Mona";"You got another ex-wife back there?"
"Ross";"(fakes a laugh) Please start drinking! (exits)"
"Rachel";"(entering) I’m just going to grab the phone."
"Mona";"Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but,but, um… what are you doing?"
"Rachel";"Oh, I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?"
"Mona";"No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment,and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why don’t you go back to your place andgive us some privacy?"
"Rachel";"(as Ross enters with a present) But, but, Mona, I live here."
"Ross";"(handing Mona the present) Happy Valentine’s Day! …Or something toremember me by."
"Monica";"How long has it been this time?"
"Chandler";"90 seconds."
"Monica";"That’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think aboutit…except all I did was think about it."
"Chandler";"You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, wasmy father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make thatmy screensaver!"
"Monica";"Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don’t we get rid of the tapeand pretend it never existed?"
"Chandler";"I can do that."
"Monica";"Okay."
"Chandler";"Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair."
"Monica";"Oh, thank God!"
"Chandler";"Oh, I know!"
"Monica";"Come in!"
"Rachel";"(entering) Hi! I’m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine’s, butI had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross."
"Monica";"Oh, my God."
"Chandler";"Poor Ross."
"Chandler";"Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this hecloses the drapes!"
"Monica";"Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here."
"Chandler";"Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it."
"Rachel";"Why? You saw it? Is it scary?"
"Chandler";"Well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone beingborn can make you want to kill yourself."
"Rachel";"Well, now, wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watchit with me."
"Monica";"No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!"
"Rachel";"C’mon, seriously, you guys, you’re not going to make me watchthis alone!"
"Monica";"She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape."
"Chandler";"(with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) Thisreminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in, and they allsit down) Okay, here we go."
"Rachel";"Okay. (watching the tape) Ooh, my! (Rachel jumps when the woman startsscreaming) Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!"
"Chandler";"Why have I seen this thing three times?!"
"Monica";"It’s…still beautiful."
"Rachel";"Uh! It’s horrible!"
"Monica";"I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!"
"Rachel";"Oh, my God!"
"Chandler";"Wait, you guys, look!"
"Rachel";"What? Did her ass explode?!"
"Chandler";"No, the baby’s out! Look, look!"
"Monica";"Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!"
"Chandler";"And look how happy the mom is now!"
"Monica";"Oh…Rach!"
"Rachel";"Oh, screw you guys, you don’t have to do it!"
"Ross";"Hey, hey, man!"
"Joey";"Hey, what’s up?"
"Ross";"Uh…Mona just dumped me."
"Joey";"Oh, man, I’m sorry. Why?"
"Ross";"Well, with everything that’s been going on lately, I haven’texactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn’t tell her I got Rachelpregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then Ilied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for notbreaking up with me sooner, you know?"
"Joey";"Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine’s Day."
"Ross";"Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a dateon Valentine’s Day? What’s going on, huh? Girl trouble?"
"Joey";"Sort of."
"Ross";"Really?!"
"Joey";"You don’t have to seem so happy about it."
"Ross";"Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it."
"Joey";"Oh, I…I d—"
"Ross";"Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y’know, actuallyonce—once I got dumped during sex."
"Ross";"Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?"
"Joey";"Forget about it. It’s no big deal."
"Ross";"C’mon! Joey! What is it?"
"Joey";"It’s nothing."
"Ross";"Hey, hey, it’s me. Why can’t you tell me?"
"Joey";"Okay, uh…sit down. (they do) Um… there’s this woman that Ilike. A lot. But, uh…it can’t happen."
"Ross";"She’s not a Tribbiani?"
"Joey";"No!"
"Ross";"I knew it. So, is she someone from work?"
"Joey";"Yes."
"Ross";"Well, uh, does she like you?"
"Joey";"Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn’t matter, because Ican’t do anything about it."
"Ross";"Why not?"
"Joey";"Well, it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time.Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we’re reallygood friends."
"Ross";"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he still in lovewith her?"
"Joey";"No. I don’t think so."
"Ross";"Okay. Um… is he a good guy?"
"Joey";"Yeah, he’s the best."
"Ross";"Then talk to him! He might be fine with it."
"Joey";"Oh, I don’t know."
"Ross";"Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her."
"Joey";"I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep,I—"
"Ross";"Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happento you, huh? You owe it to yourself."
"Gunther";"(placing a cup in front of Ross) Here’s your warm milk."
"Ross";"I’m going to…uh…I’m going to, um, put the bourbon in itat home."
"Joey";"Oh, yeah."
"Ross";"Anyway… seriously, uh…just…just talk to the guy, okay? Andtell me how it goes. (walks towards the door until…)"
"Joey";"It’s Rachel."
"Rachel";"(thinking)"
"Woman on TV";"I came to the big city to become a star! I’ll do…anything tomake that happen!"
"Man on TV";"Anything?"
"Rachel";"(thinking)"
"Joey";"There’s this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, it’scomplicated.  She’s with this other guy.  For a long time.  And Icould never do that to the guy, y’know?  ’Ccause we’re really goodfriends."
"Ross";"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he a good guy?"
"Joey";"Yeah, he’s the best."
"Ross";"Then talk to him! He might be fine with it."
"Joey";"Oh, I don’t know."
"Ross";"Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her."
"Joey";"I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep,I—"
"Ross";"Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happento you, huh? You owe it to yourself. (Walks towards the door until…)"
"Joey";"It’s Rachel."
"Ross";"(closes the door) Did you um—I’m sorry, did you just sayit’s Rachel?"
"Joey";"Yes."
"Ross";"Um, you…you like Rachel?"
"Joey";"Yes. I like Rachel."
"Ross";"Rachel?!"
"Joey";"(startled) Yeah, okay but look, buy uh—Hey-hey, y’know,y’know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn’t get said enough. I like you Ross."
"Ross";"But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!"
"Joey";"Yeah, but it’s not a big deal."
"Ross";"It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…whatabout all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’tstop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?"
"Joey";"I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be overdramatic."
"Ross";"Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?"
"Joey";"Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-butit’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are justfeelings, they’re gonna go away."
"Ross";"Y’know what? I-I gotta go. (Starts to leave.)"
"Joey";"Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…"
"Ross";"(stops) I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?!"
"Rachel";"Oh-oh! Okay, she’s kicking!"
"Chandler";"Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) She’s growing inside you."
"Rachel";"Whoa!!"
"Chandler";"Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)"
"Rachel";"Wow that was a big one."
"Chandler";"I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Oh hey you guys!"
"Chandler";"Oh hey!"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?"
"Rachel";"Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out therefor everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s whyI stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me."
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?"
"Chandler";"No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for eachother and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist."
"Phoebe";"Okay, good."
"Chandler";"Why?"
"Phoebe";"Well last night, I met Monica’s."
"Chandler";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her otherhalf."
"Chandler";"Come on, don’t be crazy. (To Rachel) You don’t thinkthere’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks athim.)"
"Rachel";"(To Phoebe) Well, what’s he like?!"
"Phoebe";"Well he’s tall."
"Rachel";"Uh-huh."
"Phoebe";"He has brown hair."
"Rachel";"Of course, of course."
"Chandler";"A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!"
"Phoebe";"He works with food!"
"Rachel";"Oh sure. Older?"
"Phoebe";"Obviously, and he’s British."
"Rachel";"Oh, I was just gonna ask!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah? And, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident."
"Rachel";"Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet."
"Chandler";"Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’retalking about."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I’m so sorry. Um, and maybe I’m wrong! Ibut—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more."
"Chandler";"You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’restill gonna date him?"
"Phoebe";"Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat."
"Monica";"Hey."
"Ross";"Hey."
"Monica";"I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were."
"Ross";"Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel Imean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!"
"Monica";"All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive,but don’t say that again."
"Ross";"Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be thestepfather of my child."
"Monica";"Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about!First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even ifhe did you have no idea how she’d react."
"Ross";"Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s avirgin."
"Monica";"Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!"
"Ross";"He’s not?"
"Monica";"No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean,listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont."
"Ross";"Why?"
"Monica";"He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him."
"Ross";"Hate him? I… No, I don’t hate him. (Pause) It’s justit’s Rachel, y’know?"
"Monica";"Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, Idon’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know thatyou’re still his friend."
"Ross";"Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him."
"Monica";"All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollarsinto Vermont money."
"Phoebe";"Oh! Hi!"
"Monica";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don."
"Don";"Oh, hello. (Shakes Chandler’s hand.) Hello. (Shakes Monica’shand.)"
"Phoebe";"(mouths to Chandler) Soul mate."
"Chandler";"(mouths to Phoebe) What?"
"Phoebe";"(cough talks) Soul mate."
"Monica";"So, what have you guys been doing?"
"Don";"Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all thesun-dried tomatoes at that place?"
"Monica";"I know! What is this, 1985?!"
"Don";"That’s exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn’t that strange."
"Monica";"Not really."
"Chandler";"What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.)On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still there’s staring.) No?"
"Monica";"So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?"
"Don";"Well, Octavio, 27&7—Oh! And there’s this great little place,Alessandro’s."
"Monica";"Oh my God! That’s my restaurant, I’m the chef there."
"Don";"You’re kidding me!"
"Monica";"No!"
"Don";"Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu,once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?"
"Monica";"Oh, I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonnatalk about me, I’m gonna go with you."
"Chandler";"What are you doing?!"
"Phoebe";"Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! Andthe good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…"
"Chandler";"I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!"
"Phoebe";"They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I thinkthey’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen."
"Monica";"(returning) Phoebe, good work."
"Phoebe";"Yeah?"
"Monica";"Yeah! Oh he’s great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares atPhoebe.)"
"Phoebe";"Don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else."
"Joey";"Hey."
"Ross";"Hey."
"Joey";"Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it."
"Ross";"No, I don’t want to hit you."
"Joey";"Oh what then? Kick me?"
"Ross";"No."
"Joey";"(getting worried) Bite me?"
"Ross";"No, no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want totell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. Ijust, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)"
"Joey";"Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer orsomething?"
"Ross";"Uh…yeah sure. (Enters.)"
"Joey";"Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachelleft. I don’t…"
"Ross";"Okay."
"Joey";"(pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand somethingokay? I uh…I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never doanything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)"
"Ross";"Thank you."
"Joey";"Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get overher, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never beenin love before so…"
"Ross";"What?! You’re in love with her."
"Joey";"Yeah, I thought you knew that."
"Ross";"Umm, no."
"Joey";"Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. Ijust keep thinking, "Ah, I’ll get over this." Y’know? I just—Itjust keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t, I don’t know what to do. Y’know?What do I do?"
"Ross";"I think you need to tell her how you feel."
"Joey";"Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’."
"Ross";"No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because ifshe’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this."
"Joey";"But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…"
"Ross";"If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about itshouldn’t stand in the way."
"Joey";"Are you sure?"
"Ross";"Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth isshe couldn’t find a better guy. So…"
"Joey";"Hey thanks."
"Ross";"So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?"
"Joey";"Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what Iwill say. What should I say?"
"Ross";"I’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away."
"Joey";"I’m sorry, you’re right. What am I gonna say? (He takes anothersip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!"
"Ross";"Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoysanother sip.)"
"Don";"…so I’ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusingmore on the cheese side of things."
"Chandler";"Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?"
"Don";"Excuse me?"
"Chandler";"Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too."
"Don";"Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I’m one of the people whothinks the smellier the better."
"Monica";"Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow meto have blue cheese in the house."
"Don";"And you’re still married to him? (They both laugh, and Chandler triesto but fails.)"
"Monica";"You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eatnothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah.Ah, and pastries… (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, I’m really not high, it’sjust I used to be fat."
"Don";"Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I’ve got agreat little villa you can stay at."
"Chandler";"Is it made of cheese?"
"Don";"No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!"
"Monica";"I’d move in tomorrow!"
"Chandler";"(disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?"
"Phoebe";"I’m so sorry."
"Chandler";"What do we do?"
"Phoebe";"I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! Idon’t know how you fight that."
"Joey";"Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just standup straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so asRachel opens the door and startles him.)"
"Rachel";"Joey? What’s up?"
"Joey";"I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something."
"Rachel";"Okay what’s up?"
"Joey";"Here? In the hall? What are we animals?"
"Rachel";"Well honey, I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?"
"Joey";"Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner withyou tonight. That’s all."
"Rachel";"Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where tomeet you. Okay? (Walks away.)"
"Joey";"Okay. That’s good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare whatyou’re gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startlesJoey again.) Don’t you people ever knock?!"
"Monica";"I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?"
"Chandler";"Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here,browsing through the personals."
"Monica";"Are you okay? You’ve been acting weird all afternoon."
"Chandler";"Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough."
"Monica";"Jeez! What is with you?"
"Chandler";"I’m sorry, did you say cheese?"
"Monica";"All right, what’s going on?"
"Chandler";"Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe inthat kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand inyour way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese."
"Monica";"Chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?"
"Chandler";"No. But I’m sure (mimics Don) ‘tomatoes’ does."
"Monica";"I don’t believe in soul mates either."
"Chandler";"You don’t?"
"Monica";"No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together.I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work reallyhard."
"Chandler";"So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?"
"Monica";"No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hardthat would be to clean?"
"Chandler";"I love you."
"Monica";"I know."
"Chandler";"Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. Ifound this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monicadoesn’t look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good."
"Rachel";"…and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time hetouches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him.(Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?"
"Joey";"What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason…(Exhalesslowly)—Is it hot in here?"
"Rachel";"No. Not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?"
"Joey";"I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvindoing Hobbs."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?"
"Joey";"Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweaterout, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)"
"Rachel";"Huh. Wow, I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much."
"Joey";"Uh… How long have we known each other?"
"Rachel";"Um, seven…e-e-eight,"
"Joey";"Uh-huh, long time."

"Rachel";"Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here."
"Joey";"Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don’t have to say anything.You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (Long pause as Rachel says nothing.) Okay,you gotta say something!"
"Rachel";"Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I…"
"Joey";"But. (Hangs his head down.)"
"Rachel";"Joey."
"Joey";"Yeah-yeah right. That’s okay. That’s fine. That’s uh,pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it’s no big deal. All right? I thinkI’m gonna go. (Stands up.)"
"Rachel";"No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this!Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)"
"Joey";"Don’t start doing that. You can’t do that Rach, ‘cause thenyou’re gonna make me do that. (Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next toher.)"
"Rachel";"Can I? (Hug him.)"

"Joey";"Oh no-no Rach, please, don’t be sorry. Okay? Don’t be sorry.(They hug again.) Y’know I was only kidding you."
"Rachel";"Yeah, that was a real good one."
"Waiter No. 2";"Is this your table?"
"Waiter";"Yeah."
"Waiter No. 2";"God, you’re gonna be here all night!"
"Waiter";"I know! I haven’t even read them the specials yet!"
"Waiter No. 2";"What’s the matter with them?"
"Waiter";"I don’t know. I think maybe one of them is dying. (Pause) I kindahope it’s the girl. (The other waiter is shocked.) The guy is really cute!"
"Rachel";"Joey? Are you in there?"
"Joey";"(hearing Rachel and jumping up with his plate) Oh God! That’s Rachel!"
"Monica";"Joey, you"
"Joey";"No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’sjust it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here! (Turns to run tothe bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Don’t eat that! (Runsto the bathroom as Rachel enters.)"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey Rachel!"
"Rachel";"Is Joey here?"
"Chandler";"I don’t see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?"
"Monica";"I don’t see him. Hey! Maybe he’s in the sugar bowl! (Opens thesugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)"
"Rachel";"Well, at least you make each other laugh."
"Monica";"What’s up?"
"Rachel";"Well, I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how hey’know… I don’t know, I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel onthe floor?"
"Monica";"We were playing a game."
"Rachel";"Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind ofsituation?"
"Monica";"Sure."
"Chandler";"What?! No! No!"
"Rachel";"All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell himuh…tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)"
"Monica";"(To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?"
"Joey";"Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler)Dude, I don’t know. That’s a pretty small hole."
"Monica";"Honey, you gotta talk to her."
"Joey";"I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like toput yourself out there like that and just get shot down."
"Chandler";"(incredulous) I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!""
"Monica";"Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are meanwhen they’re hungry."
"Joey";"All right so, so what do I do?"
"Monica";"This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk toher again? I mean I know it’s weird, it’s awkward, but you gotta at least try."
"Joey";"Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.)Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your…"
"Chandler";"(interrupting him) We didn’t play it!!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at yourleaves and tell you your fortune."
"Chandler";"I didn’t know you read tea leaves."
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I wasso accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life isit’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give methe trots."
"Monica";"Okay, I’m done. Read mine."
"Phoebe";"Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book)Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death."
"Monica";"(stunned) I-I’m the head chef. I-I can’t get promoted."
"Phoebe";"Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who’s next?"
"Rachel";"Okay, I’m done. Do mine."
"Phoebe";"Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle."
"Rachel";"Ah."
"Phoebe";"Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean you’re having a babyor you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!"
"Rachel";"Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab."
"Chandler";"What does yours say Pheebs?"
"Phoebe";"Umm… Wow, all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, I’mgonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he’s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probablynot the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)"
"Ross";"(entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down, like a,like a faded salmon?"
"Monica";"You mean your pink shirt?"
"Ross";"Faded salmon color."
"Monica";"No, I-I haven’t seen your pink shirt."
"Ross";"Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!"
"Chandler";"Well, I’m sure you get another one at"
"Ross";"That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!"
"Rachel";"Well just ask Mona to give it back!"
"Ross";"I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that wedidn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoringthe one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (Walksaway.)"
"Phoebe";"(noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait asecond you guys…for the last couple weeks I’ve been that guy everywhere I go. Wetake the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he’s thetea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)"
"Chandler";"Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!(Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Joey";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Hi."
"Joey";"Hi."
"Monica";"Tea gives Phoebe the trots."
"Rachel";"So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it’snot even like we know how to be with each other anymore."
"Chandler";"I know it’s tough now, but things will get better."
"Rachel";"How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, tothe point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!"
"Chandler";"I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcasticcomment? Some cheese?"
"Monica";"Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?"
"Chandler";"Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just putit in the nearest one."
"Monica";"Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?"
"Chandler";"In the James Taylor case."
"Monica";"Where is the James Taylor CD?"
"Chandler";"Honey, I’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them inthe right case."
"Monica";"Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we’rejust gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases."
"Chandler";"Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind oforder. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?"
"Monica";"Hmm, I don’t know. We really have to talk this through."
"Rachel";"Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!"
"Monica";"Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on thisuncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see himtry to get him talking about something else."
"Rachel";"Oh yeah. That makes sense."
"Monica";"Yeah, like I don’t know, maybe you have a work problem that youneed his advice on."
"Rachel";"Ooh, I can do that."
"Monica";"Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the"
"Chandler";"They were just giving those away at the store (off Monica’s look)in exchange for money."
"Joey";"(entering) Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hi."
"Monica";"Uh I really don’t know what to tell you Rach, I really don’t.I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Monica";"Yeah Joey she’s…Rachel’s got this really big workproblem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! (To Chandler) Y’know what, if we’regonna make dinner we’re gonna have to leave. Yeah. (She and Chandler exit.)"
"Joey";"So you uh, have a…big work problem?"
"Rachel";"Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’sy’know—It’s nothing."
"Joey";"Huh. Okay. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think I’m gonna take off."
"Rachel";"Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something.It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss."
"Joey";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, and umm my baby."
"Joey";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"My boss wants to buy my baby!"
"Joey";"What?! Oh my-oh my God!"
"Rachel";"I know I told you, it’s a really big problem."
"Joey";"What he wants to buy your baby?!"
"Rachel";"Can you believe that?!"
"Joey";"That’s crazy!"
"Rachel";"That’s what I told him!"
"Joey";"Okay, how did this even happen?"
"Rachel";"Well I’ll tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and hiswife—They-they can’t have children. So umm, and that—we were at theChristmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy yourbaby.""
"Joey";"Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figuredit was something about maternity leave."
"Rachel";"Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that would’ve been a much simplerproblem."
"Phoebe";"Oh hello."
"Guy";"Oh, it’s you. I see you everywhere. I’m Jim, Jim Nelson."
"Phoebe";"Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly havebeen seeing a lot of each other lately."
"Jim";"We have. Maybe we’ll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night,say around 8 o’clock?"
"Phoebe";"Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around andthe exchange information.)"
"Ross";"Mona? (There’s no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers whereher extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. Helooks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to hisbrain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth tosqueal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses thekey to open the door and enter Mona’s apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,where would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)"
"Mona";"(entering, with her date) I am so sorry I spilled wine all over yourshirt."
"Mona's Date";"Oh, it’s okay."
"Mona";"No, it’s still wet. Y’know what? Let me get it out before itsets. Ooh, I have something you can wear. Here. (Hands him Ross’s shirt.)"
"Mona's Date";"Oh umm, I-I don’t know if I want to wear a woman’s shirt."
"Mona";"No-no that’s a man’s shirt."
"Mona's Date";"It’s awfully pink. (Ross mouths, "It’ssalmon!")"
"Chandler";"Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copiesof the"
"Monica";"Honey, both yours."
"Rachel";"(entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!"
"Monica";"Yeah? The work problem?"
"Rachel";"Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again."
"Chandler";"What problem did you tell him you had?"
"Rachel";"Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I thinkeverything’s gonna be okay."
"Mr. Zelner";"May I help you?"
"Joey";"Do you think you can just"
"Phoebe";"Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as ifsomeone really wants us to be together."
"Jim";"Someone does. Me."
"Phoebe";"Oh, witty banter. Well done."
"Jim";"So, tell me a little bit about yourself."
"Phoebe";"Oh okay, well I’m a masseuse, and I used to work at thisplace…"
"Jim";"Do you like to party?"
"Phoebe";"I-I-I like, I like parties."
"Jim";"You’re wild, aren’t ya?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah I guess, a little."
"Jim";"It ain’t no thing, I’m wild too."
"Phoebe";"(a little freaked out) So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someonewildly I guess, for umm—Well since I was fourteen."
"Jim";"I’m sorry. I’m staring. It’s just that you have the mostbeautiful eyes."
"Phoebe";"Oh stop it."
"Jim";"And your breasts! Hmm!!!"
"Phoebe";"Okay. Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong. But I’mgoing to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants tobe together. So, why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me aboutyourself."
"Jim";"All right."
"Phoebe";"Okay."
"Jim";"I write erotic novels, for children."
"Phoebe";"What?!"
"Jim";"They’re wildly unpopular."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God!"
"Jim";"Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D."
"Phoebe";"Wow! You do?"
"Jim";"Yeah, (looks at his crotch) a Pretty Huge…"
"Phoebe";"All right. (Gets up and walks out.)"
"Chandler";"(singing)"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday aboutthat thing with my boss. That really meant a lot."
"Joey";"Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy’s not going to bebothering you about that baby thing anymore."
"Rachel";"(worried) What?"
"Joey";"Let’s just say I took care of it."
"Rachel";"Whoa-whoa-whoa, let’s say more!"
"Joey";"Don’t worry! Don’t worry. I just told him, very nicely,"You don’t go buying people’s babies, so back off!!""
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Chandler and Monica";"What?!"
"Rachel";"No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn’t want to buy my baby! I made thatup!"
"Joey";"What?! Why?!"
"Rachel";"So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t beawkward!"
"Joey";"And you couldn’t think of anything else?!"
"Monica";"You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!"
"Rachel";"(To Joey) I can’t believe that you yelled at my boss!I’m-I’m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!"
"Chandler";"You can always sell your baby."
"Rachel";"Oh Joey, I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’mgonna get fired!"
"Joey";"You lied to me!"
"Rachel";"Well, she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)"
"Monica";"Chandler has two copies of"
"Mona";"(seeing Ross) Oh my God! Ross!!!"
"Ross";"Hello!!"
"Mona";"Ross, what are you doing?!"
"Ross";"Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable."
"Rachel";"Morning. You wanted to see me?"
"Mr. Zelner";"Please, come in. Have a seat. (She does so.)"
"Rachel";"Okay look Mr. Zelner…"
"Mr. Zelner";"Oh I think it’s best that I speak first."
"Rachel";"Yeah. (Motions for him to continue.)"
"Mr. Zelner";"I’ve asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness toour conversation."
"Rachel";"Oh God."
"Mr. Zelner";"If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby…I amsorry. Okay? Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did notmean that I felt that"
"Rachel";"Well, as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh there it is."
"Monica";"That’s not your regular dry cleaners."
"Phoebe";"I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so Ihave to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adultbookstore, a new grocery store…"
"Monica";"What?!"
"Phoebe";"A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guyand that’s what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there I’m going to kicksome ass."
"Monica";"Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet agreat guy, so can you."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, we both can. And we both will."
"Phoebe";"Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me."
"Monica";"Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like"
"Phoebe";"Okay."

"Phoebe";"What?"
"Guy";"I’m sorry, it’s just that you’re so incredibly beautiful."
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going todo?"
"Guy";"I hope you don’t think I’m crazy but I feel like I was meant topick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?"
"Phoebe";"A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) Nowyou’re talking."
"Guy";"Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?"
"Phoebe";"I-I-I’d love to. Let me just tell my friend."
"Monica";"(to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?"
"Phoebe";"(looking around) She must’ve left."
"Rachel";"Hi."
"Joey";"So? What-what-what happened?"
"Rachel";"It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’mnot suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as Iunderstand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any otherchild I should bear."
"Chandler";"Wow,"
"Rachel";"Chandler, can you give us a minute?"
"Chandler";"Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"I’ll be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)"
"Rachel";"Joey, I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying tomake things…"
"Joey";"I know. I know."
"Rachel";"It kinda worked. I mean y’know, I don’t know about you buy Ihaven’t thought about our thing since all this."
"Joey";"Hey you’re right. Yeah, it’s kinda been like us again a littlebit."
"Rachel";"Yeah I know! I miss that."
"Joey";"Me too. I mean I…haven’t thought at all about how I put myselfout there and said all that stuff and how you didn’t feel the same way about meand-and how it was really awkward."
"Rachel";"My gynecologist tried to kill me."
"Ross";"(on phone) Item J437-A, color: winterberry. (There’s a knock on thedoor as he hangs up the phone. He answers it to Mona.) Hi umm, listen come here, come in.(She does so.) I’m so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I’m really sorry. It’sjust that I… (He picks up the pink shirt.)"
"Mona";"(interrupting him) Listen Ross, you don’t have to apologize. Iunderstand why you were there."
"Ross";"You do?"
"Mona";"Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still havefeelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can’t. It’stoo complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meantto be."
"Ross";"(faking starting to cry) Oh God you’re right."
"Mona";"Ross, we…we have to be strong. Okay, I-I’m gonna go. (She picksup the shirt Ross has just set down.) Can I? To remember you?"
"Ross";"(laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’sanniversary party?"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Sure. Yeah."
"Joey";"So, who’s the guy?"
"Phoebe";"Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners."
"Chandler";"Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who saidthat?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest forlife, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughtygirl I am."
"Monica";"(To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to momand dad this year?"
"Ross";"Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20"
"Monica";"Yeah, I’d really like to."
"Ross";"Okay, hopefully this time mom won’t boo you."
"Monica";"Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it’s always reallymoving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I’m going to make them cry."
"Chandler";"And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?"
"Monica";"No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him,and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, yourbrother." Know what they’ll say this year? "God, you""
"Joey";"Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points tohimself) I’m an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)"
"Monica";"Really you can do that?"
"Joey";"Are you kidding me? Watch! (Makes funny faces trying to cry) Well Ican’t do it with you guys watching me!"
"Chandler";"What are you doing?"
"Monica";"Oh I’m working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it.Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)"

"Ross";"(picking up Chi-Chi’s picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog!Y’know Monica couldn’t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery."
"Monica";"What?!"
"Ross";"You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is…"
"Parker";"No, no, no wait! Don’t tell me. Let me guess. (Points as he saystheir names) Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, I’m sorry Phoebe didn’t mentionyou. (Chandler makes a face) Chandler, I’m kidding all ready you’re my favorite!"
"Chandler";"Ha!"
"Parker";"Why don’t all of you tell me a little about your self?"
"Ross";"Ah, actually, I’m sorry we-we probably should get going."
"Parker";"(laughs) Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I? (Putshand on her stomach)"
"Rachel";"I, uh, think you already are."
"Parker";"Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in thisworld more miraculous than—Oh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?"
"Monica";"That’s my old dog. He passed away years ago."
"Parker";"Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend,bow-wow. So where’s the party?"
"Monica";"It’s out on the island. It’s in Massapequa."
"Parker";"Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, isit steep in Native American history? {Transcriber’s Note: Interestingly Alec Baldwinwas born in Massapequa.}"
"Ross";"Well, there is an"

"Mr. Geller";"Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this."
"Ross";"Can you believe that?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, if you’re going to do the ears, you might as well take a passat the nosal area."
"Ross";"No, us having to lie about being married."
"Rachel";"No, I know I don’t either, but ya know what, it’s their party,and it’s just one night. And we don’t even have to lie; we just won’t sayanything. If it comes up again, we’ll just…smile. We’ll nod along."
"Woman";"Ross!"
"Man";"Rachel!"
"Ross";"Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan"
"Aunt Lisa";"Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding"
"Uncle Dan";"Here’s a little something to get you started. (Hands them acheck)"
"Rachel";"Oh…"
"Aunt Lisa";"So, how’s married life treating you?"
"Rachel";"(looking at the check) Unbelievable!"
"Ross";"We love marriage!"
"Aunt Lisa";"Great!"
"Ross";"Hey"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Parker";"What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, beinghere with all of you in Event Room C…I feel so lucky. I think of all the good timesthat have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but noneof them will compare with tonight! My God, I don’t want to forget this moment!It’s like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click! (He takes a mentalpicture of them all.)"
"Chandler";"I don’t think the flash went off."
"Parker";"Dahaaa! (Punches Chandler in the arm and he makes a face of pain.)I’m going to find the men’s room, be right back."
"Phoebe";"I’ll go with you"
"Parker";"Come on!"
"Chandler";"Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a hugebutterfly net looking for that man."
"Joey";"I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don’t want him complimentingmy thing."
"Ross";"I’m so we weren’t in the car! Did he ever let up?"
"Monica";"He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle."
"Ross";"(imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I musttake a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry…(He looks behind him thennotices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)"
"Phoebe";"Were you guys making fun of Parker?"
"Ross";"That depends, how much did you hear?"
"Phoebe";"So, he a little enthusiastic, what’s wrong with that?"
"Monica";"It’s just that, it’s so much."
"Phoebe";"Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you’ve dated?Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don’t do that. But, do you want my opinion? Doyou want it? ‘Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like thewho’s who of human crap. (Walks off)"
"Monica";"I feel terrible."
"Joey";"I know"
"Ross";"What was wrong with Mona?"
"Rachel";"Open it! Open it! Open it!"
"Ross";"Yeah baby!"
"Man";"So we never got to hear about your wedding!"
"Woman";"We were surprise that we weren’t invited."
"Ross";"No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a smallwedding."
"Rachel";"But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular."
"Man";"Where did you have it?"
"Rachel";"On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang"
"Woman";"Really?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, Stevie’s an old family friend. (Hits Ross’s chest)"
"Woman";"Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures."
"Rachel";"So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget toput film in the camera."
"Ross";"Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side)Umm…. what are you doing?"
"Rachel";"What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I wantit to be amazing."
"Ross";"Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a"
"Rachel";"Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic."
"Parker";"Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet."
"Phoebe";"No, I’m fine. I’m great. I’m with you."
"Parker";"And I’m with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at thisplate-bouncy thing. (Bounces the plates) What an inspired solution to man’s platedispensing problems."
"Phoebe";"Hm huh, yeah."
"Parker";"Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one."
"Phoebe";"No, that’s not necessary."
"Parker";"Please."
"Phoebe";"No, actually I don’t eat…"
"Parker";"I won’t quit until you try."
"Phoebe";"Okay, fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it whiledropping it on the floor) Mmm…hmmmmm…."
"Parker";"What are they like? I’ve never had one."
"Phoebe";"Why don’t you just try one?"
"Parker";"No, they look too weird."
"Chandler";"What are you doin’?"
"Monica";"Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit ‘em. Ican’t wait. They’re going to be crying so hard. They’re going to befighting for breath."
"Chandler";"Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could(Punches the air)."
"Rachel";"And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns."
"Woman";"Blind?"
"Rachel";"Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said eventhough they lost their sight, it was all worth it."
"Aunt Lisa";"I’ll bet you looked beautiful…"
"Rachel";"Well, I don’t know about that, but some said that I looked like afloating angel."
"Woman";"(To Ross) So, how did you propose?"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah. That’s a great story."
"Ross";"Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium.That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the roomfilled with lilies, her favorite flower…"
"Aunt Lisa";"Oh that is so sweet!"
"Rachel";"Shhh! I want to hear the rest!"
"Ross";"Then, Fred Astaire singing"
"Rachel";"And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!"
"Joey";"Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We werebeing jerks. Parker’s a nice guy and I’d like to get to know him."
"Phoebe";"Then you better do it now."
"Joey";"Why?"
"Phoebe";"Because I’m going to kill him"
"Joey";"What-what?"
"Phoebe";"You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. Imean I’m all for living life, but this is the Geller’s 35"
"Joey";"I know I’m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for thebuffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!"
"Phoebe";"Are you sure it wasn’t an oyster?"
"Joey";"I guess it could’ve been, I didn’t really look at it.Y’know, I just wiped it on Chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there."
"Phoebe";"He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him."
"Joey";"Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There’s nothing wrong withhim he’s a good guy."
"Phoebe";"You think?"
"Joey";"Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative."
"Phoebe";"You’re right. You’re right, he’s just embracing life. Wecould all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m asunny, positive person."
"Joey";"Actually, you have a little bit of an edge."
"Phoebe";"What’s that now?"
"Joey";"Nothing…"
"Phoebe";"Oh look it’s Parker!"
"Parker";"Look! It’s the bunny hop!"
"Phoebe";"Oooh I love it!"
"Parker";"You do?!"
"Phoebe";"Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!"
"Monica";"Okay it’s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usuallygives the toast, but this year I’m going to do it."
"Monica";"No, no it’s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I gotmarried, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the twoof you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know Iprobably don’t say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parentswill join her.) When I look around this room, I’m-I’m saddened by the thought ofthose who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to behere, but she can’t because she’s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look howcute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by thestage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she’s dead. Okay, her andNana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to herchildren in"
"Mrs. Geller";"Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasn’t itinteresting, Jack?"
"Mr. Geller";"(looking at the picture) Why don’t I remember this dog?"
"Mrs. Geller";"Ross, why don’t you give us your toast now?"
"Ross";"Oh, no, Mom, it’s just Monica this year."
"Mrs. Geller";"You’re not going to say anything? On our 35"
"Ross";"No, of course, Um… Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say…onbehalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, thatif…if in 35 years, we’re half as happy as you guys are, we’ll countourselves the luckiest people in the world."
"Mrs. Geller";"(crying) Oh Ross…"
"Mr. Geller";"I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross’s toast."
"Parker";"My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!"
"Phoebe";"Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?"
"Parker";"I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words…"
"Phoebe";"Oh thank God."
"Parker";"It’s a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in themidst…"
"Phoebe";"Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um, sit andrelax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!"
"Parker";"That sounds great. (Sits down) My God this is the most comfortable couchI’ve ever sat on in my entire life. (Bounces on couch)"
"Phoebe";"Let’s try something else, let’s play a game."
"Parker";"I love games!"
"Phoebe";"Shocking! Let’s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.(Giggles)"
"Parker";"Or…"
"Phoebe";"But, let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks firstloses!"
"Parker";"I lose, now"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! Oh my God!"
"Parker";"Is something wrong?"
"Phoebe";"Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect?Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a millionfairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!"
"Parker";"Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!"
"Phoebe";"You don’t have to put a good spin on everything."
"Parker";"I’m sorry that’s who I am. I’m a positive person."
"Phoebe";"No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at"
"Parker";"So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, lesshappy?"
"Phoebe";"Much less happy!"
"Parker";"Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "I’d better be going.""
"Phoebe";"So long! Don’t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass onyour way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)"
"Parker";"Isn’t this the most incredible fight you’ve ever had in yourentire life?"
"Phoebe";"Uh huh. (Closes door)"
"Ross";"…and then, we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the receptionwith you in the sidecar!"
"Rachel";"Ross, it just wouldn’t have been feasible."
"Ross";"But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been noproblem?"
"Rachel";"It was really fun being married to you tonight."
"Ross";"Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made."
"Rachel";"Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"That proposal, at the planetarium…"
"Ross";"I know, I know it was stupid."
"Rachel";"Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and thestars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up?"
"Ross";"No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It’show I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me."
"Rachel";"Well, that would’ve been very hard to say no too."
"Ross";"It’s a good thing I didn’t do it, because it sounds like itwould’ve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay, good night"
"Rachel";"Goodnight"
"Ross";"Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messedup?"
"Rachel";"I will think about it."
"Ross";"That’s all I’m askin’"
"Monica";"Okay that’s it. I give up. At mom and dad’s 40"
"Ross";"Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was abeautiful speech."
"Monica";"Oh, come on."
"Ross";"Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, wedid learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. Andyou know what? I think she was."
"Monica";"(starts to cry) Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"So, I’m in my apartment doing the"
"Joey";"(reading) Three down,"
"Monica";"How cool is this?! We know three down! I’m touching three down!(She has her hand on his shoulder.)"
"Joey";"Yeah you are baby."
"Monica";"Three down knows I’m married, what’s three down doin’?"
"Rachel";"So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?"
"Joey";"No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me,but I said no."
"Ross";"Why’d you say no?"
"Joey";"Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said Iwrite a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall downthe elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time."
"Chandler";"If"
"Rachel";"Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plusy’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! Andif you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?"
"Chandler";"Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?"
"Rachel";"Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?"
"Joey";"Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the nexttable so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid."
"Ross";"Just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know."
"Rachel";"Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal palRachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I’m gonna be in"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"The Interviewer";"I really appreciate you taking the time to do this."
"Joey";"Oh, not at all. Happy to do it."
"Monica";"(To Chandler) You think we’re being obvious?"
"Chandler";"No, we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk likethis. (Out of the sides of their mouths.)"
"The Interviewer";"(To Joey) Y’know I think its great you wanted to meethere. Y’know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to abig fancy restaurant."
"Joey";"(laughs) Actually, I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it.Wouldn’t have mattered, I’m doing this for the fans, not for the free food."
"The Interviewer";"Umm, I’ll have a cup of coffee."
"Joey";"And I’ll have all the muffins."
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey!"
"Ross";"Shhh! We’re not talking."
"Phoebe";"Oh. Finally! Oh. (Sits back in relief.)"
"The Interviewer";"So, according to your bio, you’ve done quite a bit of workbefore"
"Joey";"(He goes into a song and dance number)"
"Host";"Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get anice glass of milk, (Joey is in the background struggling to open a cartoon of milk) andthese darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open."
"Joey";"Oh, you said it Mike. (Rips open the carton and spills milk on thecounter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!"
"Mike";"And there is Kevin."
"Mike";"This is the first time he’s ever used this product, he's never used thisproduct before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. (To Kevin) Go ahead. ('Kevin'starts using the product, it is a spout that you jab into a paper milk carton so that youdon't have to rip it open.) This works with any milk carton."
"Joey";"(finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (Startsto poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday."
"Lauren";"So this is it? Victor?"
"Joey";"Yeah, I guess it is. And so… I’m gonna get on thisspaceship, (Smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, withflashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in searchof alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone. ButI won’t have aged at all. (Gets on the ladder) So you tell yourgreat-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne… baby…I’m gonnawant to meet her."
"Joey";"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, Ican't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do…so I just watch 'emhave sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, (Joey from TV)"
"Chandler";"Nice work my friend."
"Joey";"Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy'sbutt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am…"
"Joey";"Well, there are so many things, it’s hard to pick just one."
"Phoebe";"I’m gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah, I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea."
"Ross";"Uh, double latte, extra foam."
"Chandler";"And a bagel with only…"
"Phoebe";"(interrupting him) I was just being polite!"
"The Interviewer";"Okay, how about when you’re not working. What do you do inyour spare time?"
"Joey";"(drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he’s got abigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the wayjackass! (To Rachel) Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?"
"Rachel";"That"
"Joey";"What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there.(Points to the coast.)"
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding hisbreath for almost four minutes!"
"Joey";"(To Chandler) Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!"
"Chandler";"Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think thecowboy hat is a little much?"
"Ross";"(popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it'sfun!"
"Chandler";"All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on abonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?"
"Joey";"Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!"
"Chandler";"Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn."
"Joey";"I think you’re right."
"Chandler";"All right, ready?"
"Joey";"One."
"Chandler";"Two."
"Both";"Three."
"Joey";"That’s kinda nice."
"Chandler";"Yeah, that’s kinda a relief."
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"You wanna see if we still have it?"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"FREE PORN!!!"
"Joey";"Yeah!!"
"Chandler";"We have free porn here!!!"
"Joey";"In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I’m also a mento forthe kids.(The gang shake their heads.) Y’know a mento, a role model. (Chandler biteshis fist to keep from talking.)"
"The Interviewer";"A mento…"
"Joey";"Right."
"The Interviewer";"Like the candy?"
"Joey";"Matter of fact, I do."
"The Interviewer";"Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is howour soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?"
"Joey";"Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise."
"Joey";"Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without droppingit, for like an hour?"
"Ross";"Are you serious?!"
"Joey";"Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to sayanything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it."
"Ross";"Wow! We are pretty good at this!"
"Joey";"Yeah!"
"Ross";"Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!"
"Joey";"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checkshis pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!"
"Chandler";"What’s wrong with you?"
"Joey";"Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I waslifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand upsince. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious."
"Chandler";"This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you—Go to thedoctor!"
"Joey";"No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anythingit’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and showsChandler.) Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was using.)Damn you 15s!"
"Rachel";"It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. Firstthere’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made fromscratch. [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, thenbeef saut�ed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] thena little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!"
"Ross";"It tastes like feet!"
"Joey";"I like it."
"Ross";"Are you kidding?"
"Joey";"What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood."
"Joey";"The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream,limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?"
"Chandler";"That’s still in there?!"
"Joey";"Not anymore."
"Rachel";"Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor onit!"
"Chandler";"Stick to your side!"
"Rachel";"Hey, come on now!"
"Joey";"(pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin’? (Starts diggingin.)"
"Joey";"Uhh, I don’t believe in these crazy diets y’know, justeverything in moderation."
"Joey";"I’ll take those to go. (To the interviewer) For the kids."
"The Interviewer";"Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show yearsago and then they killed you off. What happened there?"
"Joey";"It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’thave said. But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today."
"The Interviewer";"Understood. So, what’d you say back then?"
"Joey";"Well, I said that I… (The gang jumps up and interrupts him.)"
"Joey";"You guys, this is Shelley, she’s interviewing me for"
"Rachel";"(interrupting him) Hi! I’m gal pal Rachel Green, and if you wantthe dirt, I’m the one you come too. This might be Joey’s baby (rubbing herstomach), who knows? I’m just kidding—Seriously, (leans into the cassetterecorder Shelley is using) gal pal Rachel Green."
"Ross";"(leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of herunborn child."
"The Interviewer";"Umm, I’m gonna just go get this warmed up. (She takes hercoffee mug up to the counter.)"
"Joey";"Okay."
"Monica";"Joey! You’re doing great!"
"Ross";"Yeah, so far nothing stupid."
"Chandler";"Mento?"
"Joey";"No thanks."
"The Interviewer";"(returning) So, as Joey’s friends, is there anything thatyou guys think our readers ought to know?"
"Ross";"Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy."
"Rachel";"(scoffs at him) Yeah, that’s gonna get you into"
"Phoebe";"Umm, I…I just think you don’t expect someone so hot to be sosweet."
"The Interviewer";"Oh! I like that. What’s your name?"
"Phoebe";"Umm, Phoebe Buffay."
"The Interviewer";"How do you spell that? So we can get it right."

"The Interviewer";"So it seems like you have a lot of friends, who would you sayis your best friend?"
"Joey";"How come you have two?"
"Rachel";"Oh, Joey! Sorry!"
"Joey";"No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it."
"Rachel";"Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!"
"Joey";"Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!"
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Joey";"Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)"
"Rachel";"I’ve never lived like this before."
"Joey";"I know."
"Joey";"All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up andeats it.)"
"Ross";"All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wannabe a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes(kisses Joey)."
"Joey";"Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and Ididn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl."
"Joey";"All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.(He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over thechicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it frommoving.)"
"Phoebe";"Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!"
"Joey";"Judge rules, no violation."
"Phoebe";"Ohhh."
"Joey";"And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!"
"Phoebe";"(turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that'sjust an old Wonton!"
"Joey";"Judge rules, Nutter-Butter."
"Phoebe";"Ohh, tough call."
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Joey";"I’d seen this thing on"
"Ross";"Wait a minute! I saw that! On"
"Phoebe and Rachel";"Ewwww!!"
"Monica";"You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thoughtI was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend thatway. So... (Looks at Joey.)"
"Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel";"(turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!"
"Joey";"That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she neededhelp! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you!"
"Joey";"Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends."
"The Interviewer";"So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a hugegay fan base?"
"Joey";"Really? Me? Wow! I don’t even know any huge gay people!"
"Chandler";"It hurts me. It physically hurts me."
"The Interviewer";"Now, off the record, you’re not…"
"Joey";"What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it justlooked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all yourstuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!"
"Ross";"Your make-up!"
"Ross";"Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face toface or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face."
"Joey";"I think face to face."
"Ross";"I would say that."
"Joey";"Face to face, yeah!"
"Ross";"Okay, here I go."
"Joey";"All right."
"Joey";"(grunting) Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!"
"Ross";"I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a littleholiday weight."
"Joey";"Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think wethought it all the way through."
"Joey";"Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebethat he’s got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!"

"Joey";"I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping.(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then thesame guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapsesit. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)"
"Woman";"Hi, is Rachel here? I’m her sister."

"Joey";"Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on."
"Janine";"I don't think so."
"Joey";"Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?"
"Janine";"I'm okay."

"Monica";"You slept with her didn’t you?"
"Joey";"Little bit, yeah."
"Ross";"Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy."
"Joey";"Oh yeah, that’s just a little something for my huge gay fan base.(Winks at him.)"

"Rachel";"What?! You mean they’re not coming to a social event wherethere’s no men and there’s no booze?! That’s shocking! I don’t care,as long as my mom’s here."
"Monica";"Oh my God, your mother!"
"Rachel";"What?! My mom’s not gonna be here?!"
"Monica";"Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully bigcoincidence if she was."
"Rachel";"My God!"
"Monica";"Well it wasn’t my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!"
"Phoebe";"Well I don’t, I don’t have a mother so often I forget thatother people…"
"Monica";"(interrupting her) Oh give it a rest!"

"Phoebe";"I know. I know, what’s her number?"
"Rachel";"I don’t know."
"Monica";"Go! I have it in my book. Go! (Rachel leaves and Monica calls Mrs.Green.) (To Phoebe) Wait a minute! If you’re in charge of the invitations why am Ithe one who has to call her—Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it’s Monica Geller."

"Joey";"Yeah, isn’t that a cool name?"
"Ross";"(simultaneously with Chandler) Yeah!"
"Chandler";"(simultaneously with Ross) No!"
"Joey";"All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don’tyou tell us a little something about you Ross?"
"Ross";"Well uh, I-I’m a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have ason Ben. Uh, hi Ben! (Waves.) And uh…"
"Joey";"I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?"
"Chandler";"Well Joey, I’m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Sovietscientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! (Waves.)"
"Joey";"Excellent! Let’s play Bamboozled! Chandler, you’ll go first.What is the capital of Columbia?"

"Joey";"This is embarrassing. (Looks it up.)"
"Chandler";"(To Ross) Can you believe how lame this is?"
"Ross";"I’m sorry, I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk toeach other."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?"
"Monica";"You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!"
"Phoebe";"What? He’s gonna be dressed as a baby! (Mrs. Green enters.) Oh hiMrs. Green!"
"Monica";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"I’m so glad you could make it."
"Monica";"Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could notfeel worse about it."
"Mrs. Green";"Try. There’s my little girl. (Goes over to Rachel.)"
"Monica";"She’s still mad."
"Phoebe";"Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make smalltalk with."
"Monica";"Phoebe, Sandra’s mad at you too. It-it doesn’t bother you?"
"Phoebe";"No look, we’ve apologized twice! I can’t do anymore than that.I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it."
"Monica";"Okay. I can do that. (Pause) I gotta go powder my ass."
"Mrs. Green";"Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If Ididn’t know better I’d say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on,let’s get some tea."
"Rachel";"Okay. (Mrs. Green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)"
"Mrs. Green";"Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked yournanny yet? Now I don’t want you to use your housekeeper ‘cause it would justsplit her focus."
"Rachel";"Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don’t even have ahousekeeper."
"Mrs. Green";"It’s like you’re a cave person. Rachel, you must get ananny. You don’t know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were ababy I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay."
"Rachel";"Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actuallythink I remember some of it, tu madre es loca. (I think that’s your mother’scrazy.)"
"Mrs. Green";"Such a sweet woman."
"Rachel";"Well, however great she was I just can’t afford that."
"Mrs. Green";"Oh Rachel!"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Mrs. Green";"I just had the greatest idea! I’m gonna come live with you!"
"Rachel";"Wh-wh-what? What?"
"Mrs. Green";"Oh, I’m so happy I’m gonna do this for my little girl. Aw,look at you. You have tears in your eyes."
"Rachel";"Yes. Yes I do."
"Joey";"All right Ross you’re in the lead, would you like to take anotherquestion or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?"
"Ross";"The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I’ll take anotherquestion."
"Joey";"Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath."
"Ross";"It’s okay, I’m ready."
"Joey";"No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you’re ready to answer thequestion."
"Chandler";"This is ridiculous, he’s not gonna hold his breath… (Rosscuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)"
"Joey";"Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia,Tris…Holy cow, that’s a big word. Trisc… Seriously look at this thing.Chandler, how do you say that?"
"Chandler";"Let me see that."
"Joey";"This one right here. (Ross whines.)"
"Chandler";"Triscadecaphobia."
"Ross";"(exhaling) The fear of"
"Joey";"No! No, fear of the number 13."
"Chandler";"Fear of"
"Ross";"It’s possible, they have really sharp edges."
"Joey";"All right Chandler, you’re up."
"Ross";"Wait a minute, I-I believe I’m entitled to use my Angel Pass for afree turn?"
"Chandler";"This game makes no sense!"
"Ross";"Y’know what? You’re just upset because you’re losing."
"Chandler";"Oh come on Ross, I think we’re all losers here."
"Joey";"All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card."
"Chandler";"Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care."
"Joey";"You-you must choose Mr. Bing."
"Chandler";"Either, it makes no difference."
"Joey";"Choose, you jackass!"
"Chandler";"I’ll take a card."
"Joey";"Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!"
"Ross";"What?!"
"Chandler";"This game is kinda fun."
"Ross";"(To Chandler) You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you getall my points just ‘cause you…"
"Chandler";"I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to eachother."
"Rachel";"Why did you invite my mother?!"
"Monica";"What?"
"Rachel";"She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby."
"Phoebe";"For how long?"
"Rachel";"Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with heris taxing."
"Monica";"I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me."
"Phoebe";"She can’t hear you."
"Rachel";"What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?"
"Phoebe";"Well, if you don’t want your mother to move in with you, just tellher."
"Rachel";"You’re right. You’re right. I mean I’m about to have ababy, I can tell my mother that I don’t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Ohmy God! She’s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!"
"Monica";"That’s right. That is right, you go over there and tell her youdon’t want her to live with you. Do"
"Rachel";"Okay. (She goes over to tell her mother.)"
"Monica";"(To Phoebe) This is great! Now she’s gonna be mad at Rachel!Y’know what? And I’m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter shenever had."
"Phoebe";"I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It’s time toopen the presents!"
"Monica";"Yes! Yes! And"
"Mrs. Green";"Well uh, I don’t have a gift because I wasn’t inviteduntil the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone’sattention."
"Phoebe";"How about you less important people, let’s open your presents!"
"Rachel";"Mom that’s okay that you didn’t get you a gift!"
"Mrs. Green";"Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me."
"Rachel";"Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own."
"Mrs. Green";"Sweetheart I know you’re gonna be terrific mom, I just thinkyou need a little help, especially at the beginning."
"Rachel";"But mom, I really know what I’m doing. I can handle this."
"Mrs. Green";"Really? Remember Twinkles?"
"Rachel";"He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, come on Rach it’s present time! Y’know you’re theglue that’s holding this whole party together. It’s kinda falling apart here."
"Mrs. Green";"Oh look."
"Rachel";"Wow!"
"Phoebe";"Okay, this is from your friend at work."
"Rachel";"Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! (She’s holding an itemwith a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box, with a long narrow tube andbottle connected the yellow part.) Wait a minute. That can’t be right. Is that a beerbong for a baby?"
"Mrs. Green";"Darling, that’s a breast pump!"
"Rachel";"Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow!What’s this?"
"Woman";"It’s a diaper genie."
"Rachel";"Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!"
"Woman";"No! It’s where you put the dirty ones!"
"Rachel";"Well that’s gross, why don’t you just take it outside andthrow it in a dumpster?"
"Mrs. Green";"Oh you’re gonna do that ten times a day?"
"Rachel";"What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indianfood?!"
"Mrs. Green";"No dear, that’s what babies do."
"Monica";"Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart."
"Mrs. Green";"Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you’retrotting out to the garbage ten times a day?"
"Rachel";"I don’t know, I’d leave it on the changing table? (Everyonegasps.) What?! What’d I do? What’d I do?!"
"Mrs. Green";"You can’t leave a baby alone!"
"Rachel";"Oh come—(Stutters)—Of course I know that. I mean of course younever leave a baby alone! I mean who would—she wouldn’t be safe as she would bewith me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y’know what? I think opening the presentsright now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I’m just gonna maybeopen them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts,and this basket is beautiful."
"Woman";"It’s actually a bassinet."
"Rachel";"Okay mommy, don’t ever leave me. (Hugs her.)"
"Joey";"(To Chandler) In what John Houston film would you hear this line,"Badges? We don’t need no stinkin’ badges!""
"Joey";"Correct! There’s a possible backwards bonus!"
"Chandler";"Madre Sierra the of Treasure!"
"Joey";"Yes!"

"Rachel";"So umm, you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?"
"Mrs. Green";"Of course I am!"
"Rachel";"Oh mom, I swear I’m not an idiot. I’ve read all kinds of bookson pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about whatto do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby’s coming and Idon’t know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?"
"Mrs. Green";"No. Sweetie, you’re gonna be fine. (Starts to get up.)"
"Rachel";"Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?"
"Mrs. Green";"I’m going to the bathroom."
"Rachel";"Okay."

"Ross";"(entering, out of breath) Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?"
"Ross";"I just Bamboozled Chandler! (Flexes in victory while everyone stares athim.) Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower."
"Phoebe";"Not if you were here."
"Ross";"Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff."
"Rachel";"Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all."
"Ross";"(excited) A"
"Rachel";"No. She’s going to live with us for eight weeks."
"Ross";"Uh, what?"
"Rachel";"Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. (Sees thatRoss isn’t happy.)"
"Ross";"What—You’re not serious. I mean she’s a very nice woman,but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She’ll drive us totally crazy."
"Mrs. Green";"(entering from bathroom) Hi Ross!"
"Ross";"Hi roomie! (Hugs her and looks at Rachel.)"
"Man";"Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show."
"Joey";"(announcer voice) It’s a pleasure to meet you Ray."
"Ray";"And this is Duncan (points to the cameraman) and Erin, they’re gonnahelp us out with the audition. So uh, let’s get the camera rolling."
"Joey";"(announcer voice) Rightie-O Ray!"
"Ray";"Whenever you’re ready."
"Joey";"(to the camera) Hello, I’m Joey Tribbiani! Let’s playBamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?"
"Erin";"Wayne Gretzky."
"Joey";"Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheelof Mayhem?"
"Ray";"Uh Joey, didn’t your agents give you the revised rules? We’veeliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards."
"Joey";"What—Why?!"
"Ray";"Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed peopledidn’t follow it."
"Joey";"Well what’s complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up theLadder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the GoldenMonkey; you yank his tail and boom! You’re in Paradise Pond!"
"Ray";"Yeah all that’s gone. It’s basically just a simple question andanswer game now."
"Joey";"Well what’s fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boringgame that’s just people standing around answering questions?"
"Ray";"Well, there’ll be women in bikinis holding up the scores."
"Joey";"(announcer voice to the camera) Let’s play Bamboozled!"
"Mrs. Green";"…and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thoughtthey might be more at home in the garage."
"Ross";"Well we…we don’t have a garage."
"Mrs. Green";"Did I say garage? I meant garbage."
"Ross";"Y’know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it’s not absolutely vital thatyou live with us."
"Mrs. Green";"Well Rachel needs help with the baby."
"Rachel";"I do. I really do. I don’t know anything."
"Ross";"I’m-I’m sure that’s not true."
"Rachel";"Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?"
"Phoebe";"No, not a thing."
"Monica";"It’s frightening."
"Ross";"Well uh, y’know what? Even if she doesn’t know anything, I do! Ihave a son. And his mother and I didn’t live together, and whenever he was with me Itook care of him all the time, by myself."
"Mrs. Green";"That’s true. You do have another child."
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Mrs. Green";"With another woman. Have you no control Ross?"
"Ross";"That’s a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes Iwill be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I wantto do all those things."
"Mrs. Green";"Well then you really don’t need me to live with you."
"Ross";"Yes! Yes, you’re gonna be so missed."
"Mrs. Green";"You’re gonna be a great father."
"Ross";"Well you’re gonna be a wonderful grandma. (They hug.)"
"Rachel";"Hello?! I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing!"
"Ross";"Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way.You’ll—you’re gonna pick it up. (Rachel doesn’t believe that.) Hey!You will! Uh look, y’know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiledhelpless little girl who-who still used daddy’s credit card. Do you remember?"
"Rachel";"I hope you’re going somewhere with this."
"Ross";"Look at you! What—You’re-you’re this big executive! You aremuch more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you’re gonnabe an incredible mother."
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Ross";"I’m telling you."
"Rachel";"Thank you. (Hugs him.)"
"Mrs. Green";"All right you two, I’m gonna get going."
"Ross";"Oh. (Rachel and he start to stand up.)"
"Mrs. Green";"Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I’ll let myself out.It’s like I’m not here, which I almost wasn’t."
"Monica";"(laughs) You’re still so funny. You’re so funny. (To Phoebe)What do I do?"
"Phoebe";"Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she’sbeen"
"Monica";"Y’know what? You’re-you’re right."
"Phoebe";"Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I’d tell her off."
"Monica";"Really?"
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh!"
"Monica";"Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! (She ignores Monica and Monicafollows her out into the hall with Phoebe in tow.) It is rude to leave a party withoutsaying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decentthing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn’t on purpose! But whatyou’re during to me now is just plain spiteful!"
"Mrs. Green";"Spiteful?!"
"Monica";"That’s right! Maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at amirror young lady…old lady…lady!"
"Phoebe";"(To Monica) Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up…"
"Monica";"So whenever you’re ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you.Good day! (Monica and Phoebe reenter the apartment and Monica closes the door on a stunnedMrs. Green.) I can’t feel my legs!"
"Phoebe";"You were fantastic! I’m so proud of you!"
"Monica";"Yeah? I’m proud of me too."
"Phoebe";"You should be!"
"Monica";"Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?"
"Phoebe";"You got it!"
"Monica";"Okay. (When Phoebe turns around Monica runs out into the hall after Mrs.Green.) Mrs. Green! Okay I’m really sorry!! I’m apologizing for the—(Shetrips and falls down the stairs.) (Pause) Okay, I bit my tongue, but I’m"
"Rachel";"(closing a book) Okay! I’m ready."
"Ross";"You sure?"
"Rachel";"Yes, I’ve done my studying and I really know my stuff."
"Ross";"All right then. (Gets up, in an announcer’s voice) Rachel Green!Let’s play Bamboozled! (Reading from a note card.) How do you test the temperature ofthe baby’s bath water?"
"Rachel";"Uh, put your elbow in it."
"Ross";"Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?"
"Rachel";"Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers."
"Ross";"That’s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when thebaby makes this sound? (Makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)"
"Rachel";"Check if it’s wet, check if it’s hungry, burp it!"
"Ross";"Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a WickedWango card?"
"Rachel";"A card! A card! I pick a card!"
"Ross";"Oh, I’m sorry you’ve been Bamboozled! You’re gonna be aterrible mother! (Rachel stares at him agape.) I’ve lost sight of why we’redoing this! (Rachel gets up and walks away.)"
"Ross";"Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on thetable.)"
"Phoebe";"Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try,"Extra! Extra! Read all about it!""
"Ross";"No, Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They allgasp.) I didn’t want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought allthe copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)"
"Joey";"Man, this is bad! And I’ve had my share of bad reviews. I stillremember my first good one though. (Quoting) "Everything else in this production of"
"Monica";"(entering) Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Monica";"(seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers!It must be a good review! Is it great?!"
"Ross";"Umm…"
"Monica";"(reading) Oh dear God!"
"Ross";"But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know."
"Monica";"What about the rest of Manhattan?!"
"Ross";"Yeah, they all know."
"Monica";"Oh my God, this is horrible!"
"Chandler";"I’m so sorry."
"Monica";"I’m so humiliated!"
"Rachel";"Yeah but y’know what they say Mon, "There’s no such thingas bad press.""
"Monica";"You don’t think that umm, (reading) "The chef’s Mahi Mahiwas awful awful," is bad press?"
"Rachel";"I didn’t write it."
"Monica";"Is he right? Am I really—Am I awful?"
"All";"No!"
"Joey";"Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I’m not just sayingthis because I’m your friend, I’m sayin’ it ‘cause it’s thetruth. You’re food is abysmal!"
"Rachel";"Ross!"
"Ross";"(startling him) What?! What?"
"Rachel";"I am freaking out!"
"Ross";"Are ya?"
"Rachel";"My due date is in one week!"
"Ross";"What are you doing up?"
"Rachel";"That is seven days!"
"Ross";"Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do thisafter…"
"Rachel";"(interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not haveany of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do nothave a diaper service!"
"Ross";"It’s funny you should mention diapers."
"Rachel";"I’m serious."
"Ross";"Okay look, there’s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time.There’s a great baby furniture store on west 10"
"Rachel";"Okay. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west10"
"Ross";"(interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh, if you’re gonna do this, thenI’m gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So… (Starts for the bathroom.)"
"Rachel";"(stopping him) Oh, wait Ross! I’m sorry, one more thing!"
"Ross";"(annoyed) Yeah!"
"Rachel";"Umm, our situation. Y’know umm, what we mean to each other. And Imean we-we’re having this baby together, and we live together. Isn’t that,isn’t that weird?"
"Ross";"(stunned) (thinks) Well uh…"
"Rachel";"I’m just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.)"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey uh Monica, I can’t remember. Did we say we were gonnameet here or at the movies?"
"Monica";"We said at the movies, but…"
"Joey";"Okay, I’ll see you there. (Starts to leave)"
"Monica";"Joey! (He returns) Now that you’re here…"
"Joey";"Sure, I can hang out ‘til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) Whatuh—How come you’re not going?"
"Chandler";"I have a job interview I have to get ready for."
"Joey";"I thought you already have a job."
"Chandler";"And people say you don’t pay attention. No, this is a much betterjob. It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statisticalfactoring for other companies."
"Joey";"Wow! How do you know how to do that?!"
"Chandler";"That’s what I do now."
"Monica";"Hey Joey, come taste this."
"Joey";"What is it?"
"Monica";"Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well… (Feeds him aspoonful of what she’s cooking.) I’m getting my revenge!"
"Joey";"You cooked him?"
"Monica";"No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so beforewe go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, Icannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! "Restaurant reviewer admits:I was wrong about Monica.""
"Chandler";"The front page? You really do live in your own little world,don’t ya?"
"Cashier";"Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?"
"Rachel";"Oh."
"Ross";"Oh."
"Rachel";"No-no-no! No, no, no, we’re not married."
"Ross";"We are having a baby together, but we’re not involved. (The cashier,a very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a whileago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks athim angrily) Or, yes stranger, we’d like this delivered please."
"Cashier";"Why don’t you fill out this address card. (Hands him one.)"
"Ross";"Oh, okay."
"Cashier";"I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items."
"Rachel";"Oh yeah! Actually, that’s one of the reasons why we’re not acouple."
"Ross";"I chose those, I’m a paleontologist."
"Cashier";"Really?! That is so cool!"
"Rachel";"Oh. Oh yeah, don’t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it soundslike he’s a doctor, but he’s not."
"Cashier";"Oh no-no, I’m fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the newWalter Alvarez book?"
"Ross";"Yeah! I-I teach it in my class."
"Rachel";"Oh my God! I’m standing at a cash register, holding a credit card,and I’m bored."
"Cashier";"(looking at the completed address card) Oh, I love your neighborhood.There’s a great gym right around the corner from your building."
"Ross";"That’s my gym."
"Cashier";"I can tell you work out. (Ross is please and Rachel looks at himconfused.) A paleontologist who works out, you’re like Indiana Jones. (Rachel has adisbelieving look on her face.)"
"Ross";"I"
"Rachel";"Hi Pheebs!"
"Phoebe";"Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?"
"Rachel";"Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almostgot something that wasn’t on the list. A whore."
"Phoebe";"What?!"
"Rachel";"Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just startedflirting with him."
"Phoebe";"Well did she know you two weren’t married?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man,we-we must alert the church elders!"
"Rachel";"You don’t understand! You didn’t see how brazen she was."
"Phoebe";"Sounds like you’re a little jealous."
"Rachel";"No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’sthat I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl atSluts ‘R’ Us!"
"Phoebe";"Is that a real place? (Rachel’s stunned) Are they hiring?"
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!"
"Phoebe";"Hey Chandler, why so fancy?"
"Chandler";"Well, I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lotmore money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring."
"Phoebe";"Wait, I think I know someone who does that."
"Chandler";"Me! I do that. So… Seriously, do I look okay? I’m littlenervous."
"Rachel";"Oh yeah! You really—You look great."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, just don’t get your hopes up."
"Chandler";"Why not?"
"Phoebe";"Well, the interview…"
"Chandler";"What about it?"
"Phoebe";"Y’know! You don’t make a very good first impression."
"Chandler";"(shocked) What?!"
"Phoebe";"Oh you don’t know."
"Chandler";"Are you serious?!"
"Phoebe";"Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah."I was like, shhh!"
"Chandler";"What is it that I do?"
"Phoebe";"Well it’s just like you’re trying too hard. Always makingjokes, y’know, you just—You come off a little needy."
"Chandler";"(To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?"
"Rachel";"Chandler, I’m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away fromyou. (Gets up and hurries out.)"
"Monica";"Hi! Umm, I’m Monica Geller, I’m the chef at Alessandro’s."
"The Food Critic";"Still?"
"Monica";"I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I wouldlike for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance."
"The Food Critic";"I don’t see any reason why I would do that to myselfagain."
"Joey";"Either eat it, or be in it."
"Monica";"Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?"
"The Food Critic";"I’m torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid abeating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal. (Throws down the spoon and walksout.)"
"Joey";"Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there’s a new classcomin’ in."
"The Cooking Teacher";"Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start,can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce? (Noone can.)"
"Monica";"I can."
"The Cooking Teacher";"Okay, go ahead."
"Monica";"Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise hasshallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon."
"The Cooking Teacher";"That’s very good, what’s your name?"
"Monica";"Monica."
"The Cooking Teacher";"Monica, you go to the head of the class."
"Monica";"Okay. (Does so.)"
"Rachel";"All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are youabout keeping Ben in your life?"
"Ross";"My son? Pretty serious. (There’s a knock on the door and Ross answersit.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?"
"Katie";"Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. (Ablanket.)"
"Ross";"Ah, must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left inyour store."
"Katie";"Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my jobdescription."
"Ross";"Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the livingroom and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)"
"Katie";"Oh uh…I actually came here to ask you out."
"Ross";"Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I’m just gonna put this (Themoney) back in my pocket, pretend"
"Katie";"Sure!"
"Rachel";"Horny bitch. (They both look at her, pretending that the dinosaursshe’s holding are arguing.) No! You’re a horny bitch! Noooo! You’re thehorny bitch! No! You’re a horny bitch!"
"Rachel";"So you guys go, have a really good time."
"Ross";"(To Katie) Yeah, I’m just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip.(Katie looks worried.) Y’know because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-notbecause I’m-I’m into S&M. (Katie’s worried again.) I’mnot-I’m not into anything weird. Y’know? Just-just normal sex. (Katie isuncomfortable.) So, I’m gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachelalone.)"
"Rachel";"So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy."
"Katie";"Are you okay with this?"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun."
"Katie";"Okay. It was nice to see you."
"Rachel";"Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although youmissed a button."
"Katie";"Oh umm, actually I umm…"
"Rachel";"Oh okay, I see what you’re doing there."
"Chandler";"I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?"
"Phoebe";"Oh! It’s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can seehow really sweet and wonderful you really are."
"Chandler";"Oh good. Good, because I’m sure this interview is gonna last acouple of weeks."
"Phoebe";"All right, don’t"
"Chandler";"An hour."
"Phoebe";"I can’t help you."
"Chandler";"Phoebe!"
"Phoebe";"All right, all right, we’ll just do our best. Okay? So let’ssay I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi!Come on in, I’m uh, Regina Philange.""
"Chandler";"Chandler Bing."
"Phoebe";"Bing, what an unusual name."
"Chandler";"Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) I’ll let myself out."
"Joey";"Hi."
"The Cooking Teacher";"Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use allyour cheese?"
"Joey";"When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?"
"The Cooking Teacher";"And the cream?"
"Joey";"Cheese makes me thirsty."
"The Cooking Teacher";"Okay. Let’s move on."
"Joey";"All right."
"The Cooking Teacher";"(To Monica) Oh! Something smells good over at Monica’sstation! (She tries Monica’s fettuccini.) Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing!You’ve never made this before?"
"Monica";"Oh no! I don’t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someonewhat it’s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles."
"The Cooking Teacher";"Well, hats off to the chef."
"Monica";"I-I-I’m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn’t hear whatyou said. Umm, hats off to who now?"
"The Cooking Teacher";"The chef!"
"Monica";"That’s right."
"Chandler";"…I think you’ll find if I come to work here, I don’tmicro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating."
"Phoebe";"Um-hmm, that’s good to know. But let’s stop focusing on whatyou don’t do, and start focusing on what you do do."
"Chandler";"(suppressing a smile) What I do do…is manage to uh, create anatmosphere of support for the people working with me."
"Phoebe";"I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way."
"Chandler";"Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life."
"Phoebe";"You gotta go!"
"Chandler";"Oh! (Stands up.)"
"Phoebe";"Okay, don’t worry. You’re ready."
"Chandler";"Really?"
"Phoebe";"Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll begreat."
"Chandler";"Okay."
"The Cooking Teacher";"Ah Monica, my star student."
"Monica";"Y’know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty offashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give methe star. (Hands it to her.)"
"The Cooking Teacher";"(tasting the cookie and with her mouthful) Oh, yum-yum-yum.(Hands the star back.)"
"Monica";"Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-andI’m sorry, but I don’t care."
"The Cooking Teacher";"Okay Joey, you’re up next. (Tries one of his cookies.)This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!"
"Joey";"I can an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, I’m a dork."
"Monica";"Joey! I’m so proud of you!"
"The Cooking Teacher";"I think you should give him your star."
"Monica";"Excuse me? He doesn’t even know what he’s doing!"
"The Cooking Teacher";"We’re all beginners here. Nobody knows whatthey’re doing."
"Monica";"I do! I’m a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax!It’s not a courtroom drama!"
"The Cooking Teacher";"If you’re a professional chef, what are you doingtaking Introduction to Cooking?"
"Joey";"Yeah!"
"Monica";"I’m-I’m sorry, it’s just that umm… Well I-I cook atthis restaurant, Alessandro’s, and umm I just got a really bad review…"
"The Cooking Teacher";"Oh Alessandro’s! I"
"Monica";"You do?"
"The Cooking Teacher";"Oh yes! You’re an excellent chef! As a personyou’re a little…"
"Monica";"Oh, I’m totally crazy, but you-you like the food?"
"The Cooking Teacher";"Very much."
"Monica";"Okay then, I don’t stink. I’m a good chef. Okay. (Starts toleave.)"
"Joey";"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t want to go. I’m having fun."
"The Cooking Teacher";"Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?"
"Joey";"Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it’s time to go, it’s time to go.(Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)"
"Chandler";"…also I was the point person on my company’s transition fromthe KL-5 to GR-6 system."
"The Interviewer";"You must’ve had your hands full."
"Chandler";"That I did. That I did."
"The Interviewer";"So let’s talk a little bit about your duties."
"Chandler";"(nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right."
"The Interviewer";"Now you’ll be heading a whole division, so you’llhave a lot of duties."
"Chandler";"(trying not to laugh) I see."
"The Interviewer";"But there’ll be perhaps 30 people under you so you candump a certain amount on them."
"Chandler";"(really try not to laugh) Good to know."
"The Interviewer";"We can go into detail…"
"Chandler";"No don’t I beg of you!"
"The Interviewer";"All right then, we’ll have a definite answer for you onMonday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you’ll fit in well here."
"Chandler";"(relieved) Really?!"
"The Interviewer";"Absolutely. (They walk to the door.) You can relax; you didgreat."
"Chandler";"Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y’knowI’ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hardto sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn’t understand) Duties. (Stilldoesn’t.) Duties! (Still doesn’t.) Poo. (Still doesn’t.)"
"The Interviewer";"Poo?"
"Chandler";"Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over, thatwas the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Callsecurity! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!"
"The Interviewer";"Poo?!"
"Chandler";"I’ll look forward to your call. (Walks away.)"
"Ross";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Hi! You’re back from your date!"
"Ross";"How are you?"
"Rachel";"I’m fine, but that’s not important. What’s important ishow was she?"
"Ross";"Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee."
"Rachel";"Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table."
"Ross";"What’s uh, what’s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?"
"Rachel";"No! No, she’s—She was nice. I mean, she’s a littleslutty, but who isn’t?"
"Ross";"I liked her."
"Rachel";"Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called youIndiana Jones!"
"Ross";"Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!"
"Rachel";"No! It’s just that, Kate bothered me."
"Ross";"Why? What was wrong with her?"
"Rachel";"There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!"
"Ross";"Okay, so what’s the matter?"
"Rachel";"I don’t want you to date her!"
"Ross";"(laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous?"
"Rachel";"Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because Idon’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it’s a terrible thing toeven think this, and it’s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at myconstant beck and call 24 hours a day! I’m very sorry, but that is just the way thatI feel."
"Ross";"Okay."
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Ross";"I won’t date. I’ll uh, I’ll be here, with you, all thetime."
"Rachel";"Really? But I’m being so unreasonable."
"Ross";"True, but you’re allowed to be unreasonable. You’re having ourbaby."
"Rachel";"(starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)"
"Ross";"Do you feel better?"
"Rachel";"No, not really. You’re pressing the baby into my bladder and now Ihave to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)"
"Ross";"Uh Rach?"
"Rachel";"Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)"
"Ross";"Just one thing umm…"
"Rachel";"Uh-huh."
"Ross";"We live together. You’re having our baby. I’m not gonna seeanybody else. Are you-are you sure you don’t want something more?"
"Rachel";"(pause) Wow! I don’t know, maybe. I’m…"
"Ross";"Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin’ around! (She’s stunned) Like youdid last night when I had to pee?"
"Rachel";"(laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin’ with you too!"
"Ross";"(pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you…"
"Rachel";"Oh no-no-no-no, no!"
"Ross";"…that you actually…"
"Rachel";"No that’s just—(Laughs)—That’s just ‘causeI’m such a good messer!"
"Ross";"Rach?"
"Rachel";"Yeah?"
"Ross";"The bathroom?"
"Rachel";"Right! (Heads for the bathroom.)"
"Joey";"Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that’sthe first A I’ve gotten since seventh grade,"
"Monica";"Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?"
"Joey";"What the hell!"
"Monica";"Okay."
"The Acting Teacher";"All right, let’s start with some basics. Can anybodytell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?"
"Joey";"Yeah, this was a stupid idea. (Exits.)"
"Ross";"Hey! What are you guys looking at?"
"Joey";"Oh, it’s a poster for that World War I movie that I’m in, checkit out."
"Ross";"Yeah? Wow! It looks"

"Joey";"I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week andyou’re all invited! (They all gasp.)"
"Monica";"Are we gonna take a limo?"
"Joey";"Sure! Why not?!"
"Monica";"Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!"
"Rachel";"Well obviously I won’t be able to come, for those of you whohaven’t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y’know, I just wantto take a moment and thank you guys for how great you’ve been during this time. Ireally couldn’t have done it without you. And I have"
"Rachel";"That’s right, still no baby! (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on thecouch) Come on people! Please make some room!"
"Ross";"Uh sweetie, maybe you’d be more comfortable here? (Gets up from thegreen armchair.)"
"Rachel";"You. Like you haven’t done enough."
"Ross";"Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it’s themale, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea. (He sitsback down.)"
"Rachel";"God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!"
"Phoebe";"Oh I know, I’ve been there. I remember toward the end…"
"Rachel";"(interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, that’s a great story. Can you tell itto me when you’re getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (Tothe baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!"
"Chandler";"Let’s. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)"
"Chandler";"Hey! Did you have the baby yet?"
"Rachel";"Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’lldo it."
"Monica";"What are you doing here so early?"
"Rachel";"They sent me home from work. They were like, "Start your maternityleave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby." Well y’know what? Screw ‘em!If they don’t want me there, I’ll just hang out with you guys."
"Phoebe";"Or you can do"
"Joey";"Hello?"
"Estelle";"Joey! It’s Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and oneguest tickets to your premiere."
"Joey";"One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!"
"Estelle";"Well, I sold four of them on"
"Joey";"Oh my God. So that’s it?! I only get to bring one guest?"
"Estelle";"Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? (Joey hangs up on her.) Hello?"
"Joey";"(to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extraticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross."
"Rachel";"(overhearing that) What-what about me?"
"Joey";"You said you didn’t want to go."
"Rachel";"I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Justbecause I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible."
"Joey";"Definitely not invisible."
"Monica";"Well, well Ross didn’t care enough to be here, so I think he’sout. You snooze you lose."
"Chandler";"He’s not snoozing, he’s teaching a class."
"Monica";"Well then somebody’s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affectyou at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cutdown to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)"
"Chandler";"I haven’t seen this dress."
"Monica";"Star in a movie."
"Phoebe";"Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart.What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe."
"Joey";"Well uh…I think I want to take Chandler."
"Phoebe";"(still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster)Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe—Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor goingoff.)"
"Chandler";"You really want to take me?"
"Joey";"Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, buty’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes andhead shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back."
"Chandler";"So you’re never actually going to pay me back?"
"Monica";"Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’regonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty thisdress is!"
"Joey";"It’s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it’s-it’severything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I wasreally nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I reallywanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn’t believe in myself."
"Chandler";"I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you."
"Joey";"Thanks. That means a lot to me."
"Phoebe";"Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress."
"Joey";"(in a manly voice) I’m gonna go shave. (Gets up.)"
"Chandler";"(in a manly voice) Yeah well, I’m gonna go spit. (He goes intothe bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)"
"Rachel";"Oh, I have to pee. If I don’t come out in five minutes it’sbecause I’ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)"
"Phoebe";"When she comes out, you hold her nose, I’ll blow in her mouth, andthe kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her."
"Monica";"She’s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?"
"Phoebe";"I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while."
"Monica";"Hmm, care to make it interesting? I’ll bet you that she’llhave it by this time tomorrow."
"Phoebe";"You’re on!"
"Monica";"Okay, how much?"
"Phoebe";"One"
"Monica";"How about fifty bucks?"
"Phoebe";"Fine! I’ll call Zurich and move some money around."
"Rachel";"(calling from the bathroom) All right, who’s turn is it to help meget up!"
"Phoebe";"No one’s here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!"
"Chandler";"This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking ourpicture. How do I look?"
"Joey";"A little tall."
"Chandler";"What?"
"Joey";"Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandlerdoes so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)"
"Chandler";"It’s just so glamorous."
"Phoebe";"Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you’re still pregnant. Oh, I’msorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah, likefifty bucks."
"Rachel";"Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is asqueeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)"
"Monica";"Damnit! Damnit!! Here’s your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.)"
"Phoebe";"It’s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?"
"Monica";"Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!"
"Phoebe";"Fine! You’re on!"
"Monica";"Okay."
"Phoebe";"Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp (She puts thebill in her bra) right there."
"Ross";"(entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment."
"Monica";"She’s in the bathroom."
"Ross";"Rach, we gotta go."
"Rachel";"In a minute!!!"
"Ross";"People ask me why we’re not together, I just don’t know what totell them."
"Rachel";"(entering) All right, all right. Let’s go!"
"Ross";"Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the officeopen late for us, but if you hurry…"
"Rachel";"No, I’m fine."
"Ross";"Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate.(She’s wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)"
"Phoebe";"Good God man don’t anger it."
"Rachel";"Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I amsomewhat comfortable."
"Ross";"Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re themommy."
"Rachel";"Oh uh-uh pal! Don’t call me mommy! It’s bad enough you callyour own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)"
"Monica";"I’m actually with her on this one."
"Joey";"(onscreen) "I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you allalong.""
"Joey";"(To Chandler) Okay, this is it. It’s my big fight scene coming up.(He looks over and Chandler and notices that he’s asleep.)"
"Rachel";"Ross."
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"Can I ask you something?"
"Ross";"Uh-huh."
"Rachel";"When Carol was pregnant with Ben…"
"Ross";"Mmm?"
"Rachel";"…were you this irritating?"
"Ross";"Wow!"
"Rachel";"Excuse me?!"
"Ross";"Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you’ve been a little short with melately. I’m not trying to irritate you."
"Rachel";"Well then you just must have a natural talent for it."
"Ross";"Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speakuntil then."
"Rachel";"(silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That’sgreat!"
"Ross";"Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how todeliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!"
"Rachel";"Hi Dr. Long, how are you?"
"Ross";"(to Rachel) Oh, you’re nice to her."
"Rachel";"She has the drugs!"
"Dr. Long";"We’ll do a quick check."
"Rachel";"Okay. (Rachel lies back.)"
"Dr. Long";"So, eight days late huh?"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Dr. Long";"You must be a little uncomfortable."
"Rachel";"Eh, just a tad."
"Dr. Long";"You’re about 80 percent effaced, so you’re on your way. Itstill could last a little while longer. If you’re anxious there are a few ways tohelp things along."
"Ross";"Do them!!"
"Dr. Long";"Actually, they’re things you can do. Just some home remedies, butin my experience I’ve found that some of them are quite effective."
"Rachel";"Well, we are ready to try anything."
"Dr. Long";"Okay, there’s an herbal tea you can drink."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Dr. Long";"You can take some caster oil, there’s eating spicy foods…"
"Rachel";"Great! We will do all of those."
"Dr. Long";"…taking a long walk, and then there’s the one that’sproved most effective: sex."
"Ross";"You’ve got to be kidding me!"
"Chandler";"Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!"
"Joey";"You liked it? You really liked it?"
"Chandler";"Oh-ho-ho, yeah!"
"Joey";"Which part exactly?"
"Chandler";"The whole thing! Can we go?"
"Joey";"Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics."
"Chandler";"I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!"
"Joey";"Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?"
"Chandler";"I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic."
"Joey";"You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn’t take any of mysuggestions! That’s for coming buddy. I’ll see you later. (Starts to walk out.)"
"Chandler";"Don’t go! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry! (Sees another guywho is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!(Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance."
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Monica";"What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?"
"Rachel";"No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor."
"Ross";"Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea,caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked."
"Rachel";"Well, there is one thing that we haven’t tried, but someone thinksthat, (mimicking Ross) "That will open up a can of worms.""
"Monica";"Well what is it? What is it? If it’s gonna help bring the babyhere, like today. I mean, I think you should do it."
"Ross";"It’s sex."
"Monica";"Do it!"
"Ross";"Monica!"
"Monica";"I’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you. I mean,women have needs. Do it, get yours!"
"Phoebe";"Oh I-I don’t know about that. No, I think that if the two of youhad sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic."
"Monica";"All right, let’s be practical, if Ross isn’t willing to do it,he’s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrowChandler—Chandler is good!"
"Ross";"Monica, what is the matter with you?"
"Monica";"Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today."
"Rachel";"Why? Why today?"
"Monica";"Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the babyand I don’t want to lose again!"
"Ross";"What?! While she’s been going through this hell, you’ve beenmaking money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowersher head and shakes it yes.)"
"Rachel";"I’ll take that bet."
"Ross";"What?!"
"Rachel";"Well, I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!"
"Ross";"Can I get some of that action?"
"Monica";"Wait a minute! Now I’m betting against all three of you?"
"Rachel";"Oh honey, don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s theday."
"Monica";"Oh, okay!"
"Joey";"Hey! Sleeping beauty!"
"Chandler";"Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! Istill feel so bad!"
"Joey";"(in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?"
"Chandler";"I’m so sorry."
"Joey";"Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things betweenus! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I tookyou to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?"
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Joey";"Give me a number, I don’t want to owe you anything!"
"Chandler";"You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…"
"Joey";"Ah-ah-ah! We’re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of headshots. Right, how much were those?"
"Chandler";"I don’t know, five hundred dollars?"
"Joey";"Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?"
"Chandler";"Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots."
"Joey";"Okay, so that’s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred,that’s… (Pauses to figure it out.)"
"Chandler";"Do you want a calculator?"
"Joey";"Please!"
"Chandler";"Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he wasright.)"
"Joey";"All right, what else?"
"Chandler";"Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tapclasses…"
"Joey";"Which we’re still keeping under our hats!"
"Chandler";"Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that playwhere you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came outJamaican."
"Joey";"What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) "Thesouth will rise again man.""
"Chandler";"Yes, money well spent!"
"Joey";"Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!"
"Chandler";"Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…"
"Joey";"Okay. Okay, so I’m writing you a check for…So you fell asleepduring my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?"
"Ross";"Come on, finish your enchilada."
"Rachel";"Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working."
"Ross";"Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha… Oh God! So…so hot!(Rubs his eyes.) Oh my—(Laughs.) By the way, you don’t want to touch the pepperand then touch your eye."
"Rachel";"I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makesme want to have sex with you."
"Ross";"Stop it."
"Rachel";"Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! Weknow what’s gonna work! It’s doctor recommended!"
"Ross";"I’m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I’mdying."
"Rachel";"Oh come on Ross, we’ve done it before we’ll do it again,it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy."
"Ross";"This is insane, I’m not gonna make love to you just so thatyou’ll go into labor."
"Rachel";"Make love? What are you a girl?"
"Ross";"Always a great way to get in a man’s pants."
"Rachel";"But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think ofme as a ketchup bottle, y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it justto get something to come out."
"Ross";"I love when you talk dirty to me."
"Rachel";"Oh, I know it. You’re right. That’s not sexy. Oh…Oh!(Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bedover and get it. (Tries too, but can’t quite seem to make it.) Oh God!"
"Ross";"Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen."
"Rachel";"Come on Ross! I’m miserable here! Come on! You started this, nowyou finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me."
"Ross";"Y’know what?"
"Rachel";"What?!"
"Ross";"Forget it."
"Rachel";"Oh wow! What now Ross you’re not gonna talk? How on earth will youever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you’d thinkthe damn jalepeno would’ve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That’s notenough… (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!"
"Ross";"I’m getting that baby out of you!"
"Rachel";"(breaking the kiss) Oh God!"
"Ross";"Oh, I know."
"Rachel";"Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke."
"Ross";"I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got thekeys?"
"Rachel";"Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Ross";"We’re having a baby."
"Rachel";"I didn’t uh, really have time to read this part of the books, butdo you think we have time to…"
"Ross";"Not so much."
"Rachel";"Okay."

"Phoebe";"Thank you!"
"Monica";"That’s it. I’m done. I don’t care when the baby comes, nomore betting."
"Phoebe";"Okay."
"Monica";"Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) Iguess we can bet one more time."

"Monica";"How did you know that?! (Runs to yell at Joey’s apartment.) Joey!Chandler!! It’s time!"
"Phoebe";"They’re at the coffeehouse."
"Monica";"You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby isover seven pounds. (Phoebe isn’t interested.) I bet you it has hair. (She’sstill not interested.) I bet you it’s a girl."
"Phoebe";"We know it’s a girl! (Exits.)"
"Monica";"(following her) I’ll give you really good odds."
"Ross";"All right! (Checking his watch) Yes!! From home to the hospital in underseven minutes! We did it!!"
"Rachel";"(deadpan) Yes, the hard part is"
"Ross";"No, but come on, we’re off to a great start aren’t we? I knewI’d get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!"
"Phoebe";"Oh you made it!"
"Rachel";"Hi! (Ross is stunned.)"
"Monica";"How are you doing?"
"Ross";"Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?"
"Monica";"We took a cab. Did you guys walk?"
"Ross";"N… No! We took a cab too, but I did"
"Chandler";"Hi!"

"Ross";"Okay is there…some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!"
"Rachel";"Ross, you stay here and talk, I’m gonna go have a baby."

"Rachel";"(interrupting her) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I’m sorry, semi-private? We(Laughs), we asked for a private room."
"Nurse";"Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we can’t guarantee a privateroom and currently they’re all unavailable."
"Chandler";"Man, if only you’d gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares athim.)"
"Nurse";"I’m sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have."
"Rachel";"Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! (They walk away from the desk.)"
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"Give her some money."
"Ross";"I really think they’re out of rooms."
"Rachel";"They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the importantpeople!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!"
"Ross";"Well then we’d be in a lot of trouble, you don’t know where anycountries are. (Rachel glares at him.) Okay. (He goes over to the desk followed byRachel.) Uh, say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm,private rooms may have (Handing her some money) opened up?"
"Nurse";"This is a hospital."
"Rachel";"(standing up) Okay. Y’know what? I’d have to say I reallydon’t care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we haveno problem to—Whoa! (She starts a contraction) Oh gosh! Whoa!"
"Ross";"What-what?"
"Rachel";"Ow! Ow! Contraction. (Sits back down.) Ow-ow! Ow-ow! (Starts breathingheavily.)"
"Nurse";"Would you like to see a semi-private room?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, it couldn’t hurt to look."

"Rachel";"Thank you. (Dr. Long exits.) Well, I guess we have some time to kill."
"Ross";"Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! (He’s looking at the stirrupson the other bed in the room and Rachel groans. Ross then hops into the bed and puts hislegs into the stirrups.) Never done this before."

"Monica";"That’s it! Right there! Is all I wanted!"
"Marc";"I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam."
"Rachel";"Oh, that’s very—Really very-very okay."
"Marc";"Julie’s cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that’s about fourfingers. The doctor let me feel it myself."
"Julie";"Have you felt Rachel’s cervix Ross?"
"Rachel";"(simultaneously as Ross) No, I don’t think we’ll be doingthat."

"Mrs. Geller";"Just hear me out!"
"Ross";"N-no! Okay? We’ve been through this! We’re not gonna get marriedjust because she’s pregnant, okay?"
"Mrs. Geller";"Honestly! Ross, this isn’t just some girl you picked up in abar and humped. A child should have a family."

"Monica";"Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!"
"Monica";"What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?"
"Chandler";"I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us."
"Monica";"What?"
"Chandler";"Look, we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’mnot saying it has to be right now, but I’m starting to think that we can handle it.We’re good. We’re really good."
"Monica";"We are pretty good."
"Chandler";"But nothing has to happen until your ready."
"Monica";"Well maybe I’m ready now. I mean, it’s a little scary, butmaybe it’s right."
"Chandler";"What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!"
"Monica";"What?!!"
"Chandler";"I’m kidding. This is going to be fun."
"Monica";"So we’re gonna try? I mean, are we trying?"
"Chandler";"We’re trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandlerstops it.) Y’know I’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies.So, when do you want to start trying?"
"Monica";"Okay, hold on a sec."
"Chandler";"Period math?"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"Yeah."
"Monica";"Well, we could start trying. Now."
"Chandler";"Right here?"
"Monica";"No, not here. Maybe here."
"Chandler";"Wait a minute, it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill andwe’re in a building that’s full of beds!"
"Monica";"And it’s so clean!!"
"Joey";"Come on you stupid machine! Come on!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, it ate your money?"
"Joey";"(looking at her) No."
"Phoebe";"All right, I’ll see you downstairs then."
"Joey";"All right."
"Phoebe";"All right."
"Joey";"Hey I got one! I got one!"
"Man";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"Hi."
"Man";"Oh uh, up or down?"
"Phoebe";"Oh down please. (The guy tries to reach the button, but can’t.) I-Ihate to be a ball buster can I just do it? (She pushes the button.)"
"Man";"Could you press up too please?"
"Phoebe";"Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too."
"Man";"Oh yeah? How’d yours happen?"
"Phoebe";"Well, it’s a long story. It’s kind of embarrassing. Let’sjust say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. (The guy laughs.) How aboutyou?"
"Man";"Car accident."
"Phoebe";"Oh."
"Man";"Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn’t paying attention?"
"Man";"Yeah. Me. (The elevator door opens.) Oh hey, that’s me. (Rolls ontothe elevator.) Hey uh, I take it you’re just visiting someone."
"Phoebe";"Uh-huh, yeah."
"Man";"Well umm, if you have sometime y’know and maybe you might want tovisit someone else…"
"Phoebe";"Oh yeah! I-I would like that."
"Man";"I’m in the middle… (The elevator door closes, cutting him off.)"
"Phoebe";"Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!"
"Joey";"(standing behind her) Uh, you gotta press the button. (Does so.)"
"Ross";"The nurse said they’re bringing in another woman."
"Rachel";"Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn’t need to be; she’ll stillhave the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction! (Leans back on Ross for somesupport.)"
"Ross";"That’s it. That’s it."
"Woman";"Oooh, that sounded like a bad one."
"Rachel";"Yeah it was."
"Woman";"Mine haven’t been so bad. Oh! Here comes one now. (Hums then squealsa little bit.) Oh, that was a big one!"
"Phoebe";"(to the nurse) Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patientI’m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he’s likeearly to mid-thirties, very attractive."
"Nurse";"I think I know who you’re talking about."
"Phoebe";"Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?"
"Nurse";"I’m sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff…"
"Joey";"(walks up) Uh, she’s with me. (Introduces himself) Dr. Drake Remoray."
"Nurse";"Dr. Drake who?"
"Joey";"Remoray. It’s Portuguese. We need that information; I’m adoctor."
"Nurse";"A doctor at this hospital?"
"Joey";"Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want thisman’s blood on your head?"
"Phoebe";"Hands."
"Joey";"Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man myassistant described is staying in. He’s a patient of mine, I’ve been treatinghim for years!"
"Nurse";"He’s in room 816."
"Joey";"816, thank you!"
"Phoebe";"Thank you. (Starts to exit.)"
"Joey";"And what is his name?"
"Phoebe";"(coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.)"
"Monica";"I think we found a place."
"Chandler";"Okay. (They start kissing.)"
"Monica";"Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?"
"Chandler";"Okay. Uh, we’ll dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to thelight switch and finds it’s not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Orturn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays anaerosol air freshener above her.)"
"Monica";"Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay."
"Monica";"Okay. Let’s hurry—Oh wait! Do we have a condom? (He looks ather.) Oh right! (Laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.)"
"Chandler";"Yes, 98.6. You’re gonna be fine."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, this is it! (Looks in the window.) Oh, that’s him! That’shim!"
"Joey";"Great! Go get him."
"Phoebe";"Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first."
"Joey";"(looks in the window) He’s not really my type."
"Phoebe";"No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and seewhat’s he like. People tell doctors everything."
"Joey";"But you said he was this great guy!"
"Phoebe";"But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turnout to be the biggest jerks."
"Joey";"You do attract some stinkers."

"Cliff";"I’m 33."
"Joey";"Okay. And uh, are you married."
"Cliff";"No."
"Joey";"Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitmentissues?"

"Nurse";"I don’t think the next patient is very far along."
"Rachel";"Okay, well then bring her in."
"Woman";"OH….MY….GAWD!!! (Uh-huh, it’s Janice.)"
"Janice";"I….can’t….believe this!"
"Ross";"And yet somehow it’s true!"
"Janice";"I mean this is so great! We’re gonna be baby buddies! (Does thelaugh.)"
"Ross";"(To Rachel) Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!"
"Man";"(entering, carrying a pillow) Hi sweetie!"
"Janice";"Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don’t thinkyou’ve met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at thedermatologist’s office. Thank God for adult acne huh? (Does the laugh.)"
"Sid";"I still can’t believe it! I’m the luckiest guy in the world!"
"Ross";"(softly) Really?"
"Sid";"(To Janice) What’d he say?"
"Janice";"Oh y’know what? You have to speak very loudly when you’retalking to Sid, because he’s almost completely deaf."
"Rachel";"Oh!"
"Ross";"Oh there you go!"
"Rachel";"I get it!"
"Janice";"So? Congratulations you two, I didn’t even know you got married."
"Rachel";"Oh we-we didn’t."
"Ross";"No-no. We…"
"Janice";"What?!"
"Ross";"Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uhthat’s all."
"Janice";"Why?!!"
"Ross";"Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? Butwe’re very excited about this."
"Janice";"Oh. Well then shut me up. (Does the laugh.)"
"Rachel";"Just tell me how."
"Janice";"Uh-oh, I feel another one coming. (She makes a sound like a goose duringthe contraction.)"
"Ross";"Sid you lucky deaf bastard."
"Phoebe";"What else? What else?"
"Joey";"Uh, well he’s 33."
"Phoebe";"Oh. Ah-uh."
"Joey";"A widower."
"Phoebe";"Oh."
"Joey";"He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he’s not into anything weirdsexually."
"Phoebe";"Enter Pheebs."
"Chandler";"Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right nextdoor to hers?"
"Monica";"We could, or we can have sex in it."
"Chandler";"Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!"
"Monica";"(lying down on the bed) Okay mister! Fertilize me!"
"Monica";"Does that sound like Janice?"
"Chandler";"If it’s not, then there’s two of them. And that would meanit’s the end of the world!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hi."
"Rachel";"Oh hi."
"Monica";"I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?"
"Rachel";"Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow aSaint Bernard out your ass?"
"Chandler";"Weirdest thing. Did I hear—(A nurse opens the privacy screen andChandler sees Janice)—Mother of God it’s true!"
"Janice";"Chandler Bing!"
"Chandler";"Jan-Janice!"
"Ross";"Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything."
"Janice";"Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You rememberChandler."
"Chandler";"Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s theunwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?"
"Janice";"It’s you. This is yours."
"Chandler";"What?!"
"Janice";"(laughs) Look how nervous he gets! We haven’t slept together inyears! (Laughs again.)"
"Chandler";"That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?"
"Phoebe";"Okay I’ve got one for you, if you had too which one would yourather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?"
"Cliff";"I’d have to say…the talking gorilla, because at least I canexplain to him that you’re making me eat him."
"Phoebe";"Somebody went to college. Wow. (Cliff gets uncomfortable) What is it?I’m sorry. (She moves her arm, which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)"
"Cliff";"No, I’m sorry. It’s just my foot itches like crazy."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I’ll get it. (She gets up and grabs a spoon.)"
"Cliff";"Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoonme."
"Phoebe";"Relax, it’s not like we’re forking."
"Rachel";"Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I havehad no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?"
"Ross";"Y’know what I think it is? I think you’ve made such a nice homefor her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave."
"Rachel";"Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! (Starts anothercontraction as Dr. Long enters.)"
"Dr. Long";"Twenty-one hours, you’re a hero."
"Rachel";"Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or yougotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out."
"Dr. Long";"Actually, I think you’re ready to go to the delivery room."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Dr. Long";"Ten centimeters, you’re about to become a mom."
"Rachel";"My God. Okay. (Another woman enters.) Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!"
"Cliff";"Is this the same spoon that was in my cast? (Smells it.)"
"Phoebe";"Y’know what? This one is. (Eats another spoonful of pudding asCliff sees something on TV.)"
"Cliff";"Oh my God! That’s the doctor who was in my room before!"
"Phoebe";"Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet."
"Cliff";"I’m telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, askingme all these weird questions!"
"Phoebe";"Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here inyour room?"
"Joey";"(entering) Rachel’s having her baby!! (Phoebe turns and looks athim.) Which is of no interest to me, I’m a neurologist."
"Cliff";"That-that’s him! You know him?"
"Phoebe";"Okay. Okay. I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey inhere to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know, if it helps you came off great. A"
"Cliff";"I don’t believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fakedoctor?"
"Joey";"Fake? Excuse me? Hello? (Taps the TV screen.)"
"Cliff";"And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy."
"Phoebe";"You’re right, that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?"
"Cliff";"I don’t think so."
"Joey";"Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuffabout you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personalstuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to herbrother’s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!"
"Phoebe";"Uh Joey, we’re trying to dial down the crazy."
"Joey";"Right!"
"Phoebe";"Umm, look we don’t, we don’t really know each other so itwould be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something betweenus. And I don’t know about you but that doesn’t happen to me a lot."
"Cliff";"It doesn’t happen to me either."
"Joey";"Me neither."
"Dr. Long";"Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 5…4…"
"Rachel";"3-2-1 oh!!"
"Dr. Long";"Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds."
"Rachel";"I can’t. I can’t push anymore, I can’t."
"Ross";"Sweetie you’re doing great."
"Rachel";"Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!"
"Dr. Long";"Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something."
"Ross";"What? You do? You do? (Looks) Oh my God!"
"Rachel";"Don’t say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what?"
"Ross";"What is that?"
"Dr. Long";"It’s the baby’s buttock, she’s breech."
"Ross";"Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads."
"Rachel";"Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?"
"Dr. Long";"She’s gonna be fine. Okay, she’s in a more difficultposition so you’re gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!"
"Ross";"Go!"
"Dr. Long";"Rachel you’re gonna have to push even harder, nothing’shappening!"
"Rachel";"I’m sorry, I can’t!"
"Ross";"Yes you can!"
"Rachel";"I can’t!"
"Ross";"Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let’s go!"
"Rachel";"I can’t. Please, you do it for me."
"Ross";"No! Come on let’s—One more time! One final push! Ready?1…2…3! (Rachel pushes so hard her head snaps up head-butting Ross and knockinghim down.)"
"Dr. Long";"Good!"
"Ross";"(from the floor) Keep pushing!"
"Rachel";"Are you okay?"
"Ross";"You have no idea how much this hurts. (All of the women in the room turnand glare at him.) Keep going! Keep going!"
"Dr. Long";"Here we go!"
"Ross";"Oh! Oh! She’s upside down but she’s coming! She’s coming!"
"Rachel";"Oh God!"
"Ross";"Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she’s here."
"Ross";"Oh she’s…she’s perfect."
"Rachel";"Oh, she’s so tiny. (Starts crying) Where’d she go?"
"Ross";"Oh it’s okay. They’re just-they’re just wrapping her up."
"Rachel";"Okay. Well be careful with her, she’s really tiny."
"Dr. Long";"Here she is!"
"Rachel";"Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. (The baby cries.) I know. Oh.Yeah. Oh, she’s looking at me. Hi! I know you."
"Dr. Long";"Do we have a name yet?"
"Rachel";"No, not yet."
"Dr. Long";"That’s fine, for now we’ll just call her Baby Girl Green."
"Rachel";"Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green."
"Rachel";"Hello baby girl."
"Phoebe";"Can we come in?"
"Ross";"Oh, come in."
"Phoebe";"Hi!"
"Joey";"There she is!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, she’s so beautiful."

"Monica";"Oh my God! She’s amazing. Oh, oh I’m so glad you guys gotdrunk and had sex!"
"Chandler";"It’s incredible, I mean one minute she’s inside you and then47 hours later here she is."
"Joey";"(taking the baby) She looks so real! (The gang looks at him.) Y’knowwhat I mean! She’s this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and kneesand…uh-oh."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Joey";"Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was fromthe other hand so we’re good."
"Phoebe";"Okay, my turn. My turn. (Joey hands her to Phoebe.) Oh! You’re socute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! (Pause) I won’t."
"Monica";"What’s the matter?"
"Rachel";"Oh nothing I… Sorry, I just can’t stop crying."
"Ross";"The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus,you-you’re sleep deprived."
"Rachel";"So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don’t see you weepingbecause you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. (Starts to cry harder.)"
"Joey";"What’s the matter now?"
"Rachel";"I was reliving it."
"Phoebe";"Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)"
"Chandler";"So, do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that wasso original!"
"Ross";"Uh actually, we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names."
"Rachel";"Yeah, and y’know what? I love them both, so why don’t you justpick one and that’ll be it."
"Ross";"Wow! Umm, okay uh…everyone…this…is Isabella. (Rachel startscrying.) What?"
"Rachel";"That’s not her name! I’m sorry, she just doesn’t feellike an Isabella."
"Chandler";"So then I guess Ferdinad is out."
"Joey";"What was the other one Ross?"
"Ross";"Umm, Delilah."
"Rachel";"Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore."
"Ross";"So I guess we’re back to uh, Baby Girl."
"Phoebe";"Yay!"
"Rachel";"Well what are we going to do?"
"Monica";"It’s okay honey, you’ll find a name."
"Ross";"Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are goingto be."

"Monica";"Yeah, I’ve had them picked out since I was fourteen."
"Chandler";"Oh no, it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked goodisn’t it?"
"Rachel";"Well tell us! What are they?"

"Monica";"I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our ownbaby."
"Chandler";"And if not, we got to do it on a bucket."
"Janice";"(entering) Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to hisfuture bride."
"Rachel";"Ohhh! (Looks at Aaron and recoils in horror.) Wow! He kinda takes yourbreath away doesn’t he?"
"Janice";"He’s a keeper. How are you feeling?"
"Rachel";"Oh, I’m fine. (Gasps in pain as she sits down.)"
"Janice";"Can I just say, I really admire what you’re doing. Just raising herall alone."
"Rachel";"Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross."

"Rachel";"Really?"
"Janice";"I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two (Her and Emma) are onyour own."
"Rachel";"Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’vebeen alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay.

"Ross";"Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we…we gotta be careful. We…wecan’t let that happen again, y’know?"
"Rachel";"(pause) Right."
"Ross";"I mean we don’t want to go down that road do we?"
"Rachel";"No! No, of course not. No. That’s why I brought it up. (Pause) Theydidn’t have any sodas?"
"Ross";"Oh my God! I’m sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot."

"Ross";"Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel."
"Phoebe";"I’m sorry, for the last time, why aren’t you two togetheragain? (Silence from Ross.) No, I know. I know, because you’re not in that place.Which would be fine, except you totally are."
"Ross";"It’s…it’s complicated okay?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah that’s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have achild together. There is no right answer."
"Ross";"Look, we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together,and then apart, and now we have a baby.

"Chandler";"Sure."
"Joey";"Dude I just did something terrible."
"Chandler";"That was you?! I thought it was Jack!"
"Joey";"No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!"
"Chandler";"What?! Why does she think that?"
"Joey";"Because it kinda looked like I did."
"Chandler";"Again, what?!"
"Joey";"Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…"
"Chandler";"As we all are at some point during the day."
"Joey";"It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when Iknelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!"

"Chandler";"Does Ross know?"
"Joey";"Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?"
"Chandler";"Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything."
"Joey";"Oh, I like that. Yeah…"
"Chandler";"If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out,but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!"
"Joey";"(laughs) Now let’s not get carried away. (He walks away as Monicacomes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)"
"Monica";"I want a baby."
"Chandler";"Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way."
"Monica";"Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances ofgetting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?"
"Chandler";"I’m so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but noforeplay."
"Monica";"Deal!"
"Ross";"Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!"
"Mr. Geller";"Noted."
"Ross";"I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for abit?"
"Mr. Geller";"Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever."
"Ross";"(noticing something) Actually umm… (He turns Mr. Geller’s headto look at Emma.)"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hi."
"Phoebe";"Are you all right?"
"Rachel";"Uhh… I think I just got engaged."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! He did it?"
"Rachel";"Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?"
"Phoebe";"Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like tothink of myself as the puppet master of the group."
"Rachel";"And you really think this is a good idea?"
"Phoebe";"I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. Thepuppet master gets tired people."
"Rachel";"I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right."
"Phoebe";"Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so."
"Rachel";"Really?! Even Ross?"
"Phoebe";"Especially Ross!"
"Joey";"(entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’llcome back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross who’s entering.)"
"Ross";"Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guessjust…I’ll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)"
"Phoebe";"There he goes, your fianc�e."
"Rachel";"I guess so."
"Phoebe";"Although he does play with himself in his sleep."
"Rachel";"I can’t say that I’m surprised."
"Ross";"Dad, what are you doing?"
"Mr. Geller";"I think there are people in there having sex."
"Joey";"It can’t be me, I’m standing right here."
"Mr. Geller";"Wanna peek?"
"Ross";"No!"
"Mr. Geller";"Come on!"
"Ross";"Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on.(Walks away.)"
"Joey";"(To Ross) We’re not peeking? (Follows him.)"
"Mr. Geller";"Well I’m peeking. (He peeks.) Oh my God!"
"Chandler";"Hello sir, you know Monica."
"Joey";"Hey uh, is it okay to come in?"
"Rachel";"Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!"
"Joey";"Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya."
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Nurse";"Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?"
"Rachel";"Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my breast?"
"Nurse";"It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, butdon’t worry. It’ll happen."
"Joey";"(watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)"
"Rachel";"Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth."
"Joey";"Dear Lord."
"Rachel";"I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?"
"Joey";"Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…"
"Rachel";"Oh look, she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are toobig for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesn’t she lookscared?"
"Joey";"Y’know, I don’t really know her."
"Nurse";"Why don’t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. (Doesso.)"
"Joey";"(To God) Are you kidding me?!"
"Rachel";"It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!"
"Joey";"I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy! (Storms out.)"
"Phoebe";"Oh hey! Wait up!"
"Ross";"Hi!"
"Phoebe";"Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet."
"Ross";"What, that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit,although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier."
"Phoebe";"No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!"
"Ross";"What?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secretthing in a long time."
"Ross";"Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose."
"Phoebe";"Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that youwere a doctor?"
"Ross";"(pause) I"
"Phoebe";"All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that she’ssleeping.) Should we wake her up?"
"Ross";"No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted."
"Phoebe";"And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)"
"Ross";"What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-shethinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!"
"Phoebe";"Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Rossdoctors are supposed to be smart."
"Ross";"I didn’t give her that ring!"
"Phoebe";"Really?"
"Ross";"No!"
"Phoebe";"So whose ring is it?"
"Ross";"It’s mine."
"Phoebe";"Is it an engagement ring?"
"Ross";"Yes!"
"Phoebe";"But you didn’t give it to her?"
"Ross";"No!"
"Phoebe";"But you were going to propose?"
"Ross";"No!!"
"Phoebe";"Huh, I might be losing interest in this."
"Ross";"Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose toRachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wantedah…start…things up again."
"Phoebe";"Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment."
"Ross";"Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like shedidn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of thishappened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose,throw it on, and-and just start telling people?"
"Phoebe";"No! No, she said you actually proposed to her."
"Ross";"Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose! (Pause) Unless uh… (Pause)Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I woulddo."
"Chandler";"Look, we can’t stay in here forever."
"Monica";"Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn’tmake it to"
"Chandler";"This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to beashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (Theydo so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)"
"Monica";"Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?"
"Mr. Geller";"Of course. I’ll always be your dad."
"Chandler";"I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, thatwasn’t for fun."
"Monica";"It wasn’t fun?!"
"Chandler";"(To Monica) Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why… (To Mr. Geller)Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever wewant."
"Mr. Geller";"Oh, I don’t think that. Before today I never thought of you twohaving sex at all. It was a simpler time."
"Monica";"The truth is, Dad, we’re-we’re trying."
"Mr. Geller";"What?"
"Monica";"Yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant."
"Mr. Geller";"Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! (Points tothe closet) I’ll guard the door!"
"Monica";"Well, that’s okay dad, we-we can wait until later."
"Mr. Geller";"Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t think so! Aren’t you ovulating?"
"Monica";"Daddy?!"
"Mr. Geller";"Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I weretrying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That’s how I gotmy bad hip."
"Chandler";"That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet holein my head."
"Mr. Geller";"This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, shewas…"
"Monica";"Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positionsyou and mom had sex."
"Mr. Geller";"You’re right, you’re right. This is about your positions.Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, althoughit might feel good."
"Monica";"I don’t feel good right now."
"Mr. Geller";"But pleasure is important, (To Chandler) and it helps if the womanhas an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?"
"Chandler";"Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall."
"Monica";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Hey. I need to tell you something."
"Monica";"Well, now’s a good time. I’m on my way to have my ears cutoff."
"Rachel";"Joey asked me marry him."
"Monica";"What?"
"Rachel";"Joey proposed to me."
"Monica";"Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!"
"Rachel";"Well, I-I said yes."
"Monica";"What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross’s baby! It’s-it’sso inappropriate. No, it’s worse than that. It’s wrong. It’s… It isbigger than mine! (Rachel’s engagement ring.)"
"Rachel";"I know."
"Monica";"You can’t marry him!"
"Rachel";"Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweetguy and he loves me so much."
"Monica";"Well do you love him?"
"Rachel";"Sure."
"Monica";"Sure?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I mean whatever."
"Monica";"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?"
"Rachel";"No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?"
"Chandler";"You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?"
"Joey";"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took herbreast out."
"Chandler";"Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it looklike?!"
"Joey";"I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it."
"Chandler";"Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out."
"Joey";"Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. Idon’t want to hurt her."
"Chandler";"Okay, look, just do it gently."
"Joey";"You’re right. You’re right. I-I’ll go tell her now beforeRoss finds out and I’ll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by theway. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) ifyou want to check that out."
"Ross";"Hey."
"Rachel";"Hey."
"Ross";"Listen, I um… I heard about the engagement."
"Rachel";"Surprised?"
"Ross";"And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um…I didn’t propose to you."
"Rachel";"I know."
"Ross";"I don’t think you do."
"Rachel";"You didn’t propose to me. Joey did."
"Ross";"Poor baby, you’re so tired. Rach, I didn’t propose to you, Joeydidn’t propose to you, and Chandler didn’t propose to you."
"Rachel";"Uh… You didn’t propose to me, Chandler didn’t propose tome, but Joey did."
"Ross";"Joey proposed to you?"
"Joey";"I can come back."
"Ross";"Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?"
"Joey";"No."
"Rachel";"Yes you did!"
"Joey";"Actually, technically, I didn’t."
"Rachel";"Well then why did you give me a ring?"
"Ross";"Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?"
"Joey";"No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!"
"Rachel";"Yes, you did!"
"Joey";"No, I didn’t!"
"Rachel";"Yes, you did!"
"Joey";"No, I didn’t!"
"Rachel";"Yes, you did! And don’t you say, "No, I didn’t!""
"Joey";"Ahhh!"
"Rachel";"He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed."
"Ross";"Whoa! You were down on one knee?"
"Joey";"Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn’t…I didn’t propose!"
"Ross";"Then what did happen?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, what did happen?"
"Joey";"Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and youthought I was proposing."
"Rachel";"Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?""
"Joey";"No, I didn’t!"
"Rachel";"Yes, you did!"
"Joey";"No, I didn’t!"
"Rachel";"Yes, you did—Oh my God you didn’t! (Screams) Well then whydidn’t you tell me that before?!"
"Joey";"Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!"
"Ross";"Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!"
"Joey";"(To Ross) I’ll tell you about it later. Be cool."
"Rachel";"Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!"
"Joey";"It wasn’t my ring! It’s Ross’s ring! That’s why I feltso bad Rach, because he was going to propose."
"Ross";"What?!"
"Rachel";"You were gonna propose to me?"
"Ross";"Uhh… No."
"Joey";"Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}"
"Ross";"But I-I was going to see if y’know, maybe you uh, start dating againbut that—I mean that-that was all, Rach."
"Joey";"Dude, step up! I proposed."
"Ross";"No, you didn’t!"
"Joey";"Oh that’s right. There’s a lot going on here and I think I atesome bad fruit earlier."
"Nurse";"Hey, she just woke up! She’s hungry. Why don’t we give thisanother try?"
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Ross";"(To Joey) I can’t believe you told her I was going to propose!"
"Joey";"I can’t believe you’re not going to propose!"
"Ross";"Hey, I’m not going to rush into anything!"
"Joey";"Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with awoman I like to slow things down!"
"Rachel";"Oh my God!"
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";"She’s doing it Look, she’s breast-feeding look!"
"Joey";"(looking at the ceiling) Ah, it’s beautiful."
"Nurse";"I’ll come back for her later."
"Rachel";"Okay."
"Ross";"Thank you. (The nurse exits.)"
"Rachel";"Oh wow, this feels weird."
"Ross";"Good weird?"
"Rachel";"Wonderful weird."
"Joey";"Y’know what you guys? I’m uh, I’m gonna go too. And uh,I’m sorry about everything."
"Rachel";"Honey don’t worry, it was my mistake."
"Joey";"No, Rach, I should’ve told you sooner. It’s just that…Man!That kid is going to town! (Joey makes his awkward exit.)"
"Rachel";"She’s perfect."
"Ross";"We’re so lucky."
"Rachel";"We really are."
"Ross";"Look, I-I know it’s not a proposal and I don’t know where youare, but with everything that’s been going on and with Emma and…I’ve beenfeeling…"
"Rachel";"I know. I know. I’ve feeling…"
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Rachel";"Yeah. (Laughs nervously)"
"Ross";"Okay, well, that… Wow, okay, well, umm…then maybe, at least wecan, we can talk about us again."
"Rachel";"Yeah, maybe."
"Ross";"Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y’know if we…if…You’re wearing the ring."
"Rachel";"Wh-what’s that?"
"Ross";"And you told Phoebe you were engaged."
"Rachel";"I’m sorry, what?"
"Ross";"When you thought Joey proposed did…did you say yes?"
"Mr. Geller";"Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to getpregnant. (He slides them under the door.)"
"Monica";"(walking by with Chandler.) Hey dad!"
"Chandler";"Hey."
"Mr. Geller";"(pause) Sorry to bother you again, but could you pass my pamphletsback? (They do so.) Thank you."
"Ross";"You said you’d marry Joey?"
"Rachel";"Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would havesaid yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! (Pause) I’m not helping."
"Ross";"So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?"
"Rachel";"That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummya present but I am prepared to let that go."
"Ross";"So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things upagain, you were"
"Rachel";"Well—Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend."
"Ross";"Well, Chandler’s my oldest friend, but Joey’s my—No! Ah!(points at Rachel)"
"Rachel";"Ooooo!"

"Ross";"Rachel said she’d marry you?!"
"Joey";"(He looks around the room) This isn’t the right room, sorry folks.(leaves)"
"Monica";"Ok, I don’t wanna be negative so I’ll say that most of thesigns you bought are good."
"Phoebe";"No they ran out of "It’s a girl" but I can fix this one,(She writes "not" in between it’s and a) See?"
"Monica";"(looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy.(Waking him up.) Honey."

"Monica";"Honey why don’t you go lie down."
"Chandler";"No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to theoffice (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?"
"Joey";"Why’re you so tired?"
"Chandler";"Couldn’t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying aboutthis big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the moreI couldn’t sleep.  Y’know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I’ll getsix hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter whatI did I couldn’t fall asleep."
"Joey";"You know what you should’ve done, you should have told yourself thatlittle story."
"Rachel";"(enters with Emma) Hi!"

"Rachel";"Oh you guys thanks for doing this."

"Joey";"That’s not fair! I can’t do that."
"Rachel";"Yeah, I’m not so sure you should be here when he comes up."
"Joey";"See this is what I was afraid of, I didn’t think I should be hereeither but somebody (Looks at Chandler) said he’d be over it by now."
"Chandler";"Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla."
"Ms. McKenna";"The numbers we are seeing New York, Chicago, and London areconsistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields."
"Ms. McKenna";"Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on andon but instead of boring you I’ll go straight to my forty two point plan."
"Chandler";"Walter (nods)."
"Phoebe";"She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and asucking candy."
"Monica";"Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pitapocket."

"Ross";"Sure what kind?"
"Rachel";"Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t..."

"Rachel";"Blueberry."
"Ross";"Blueberry it is."
"Rachel";"Thanks."
"Monica";"Wow, he’s really not letting this go, is he?"
"Rachel";"God how long do you think that’s gonna last?"
"Phoebe";"I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thingreally quickly."
"Rachel";"Y’know I can’t even worry about that right now, cause I gotthe cutie little baby, oh I can’t believe how much I love her, I can’t getenough of her, like right now I miss her.  I actually miss her."
"Phoebe";"You know that’s… that’s her."

"Chandler";"Yep."
"Ms. McKenna";"Are you on board?"
"Chandler";"(not knowing what he’s saying yes to) Yes."
"Ms. McKenna";"Then, problem solved. Chandler will be running our office in Tulsa.You’re gonna love Oklahoma."
"Phoebe";"Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her,oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!"
"Monica";"Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby close toyour body and then swing her rapidly from side to side."
"Rachel";"Ok. (Starts swinging Emma rapidly and she stops crying)"
"Monica";"It worked!"
"Rachel";"Oh (happy) oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. (Emma startscrying again.) Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won’t stopcrying."
"Monica";"Umm, she Rach, not it, she."
"Rachel";"Yeah, I’m not so sure."
"Monica";"Oh my god, I am losing my mind."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex withRoss!"
"Ross";"Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? (He puts a bagwith diapers in it on the counter.)"
"Gunther";"Diapers huh?"
"Ross";"Yep."
"Gunther";"So I guess Rachel had you baby?"
"Ross";"Yep, can you believe it?"
"Gunther";"Nope!  I still can’t believe she slept with you in the firstplace."
"Ross";"Huh? Ooh (laughs) you mean like a… Huh?"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey. (Ross turns to see who it is, and seeing it’s Joey hejust ignores him and turns back around.) Ross, I know you’re pissed at me, but wehave to talk about this."
"Ross";"(turns back) What! (Angrily) You didn’t do anything wrong?!"
"Joey";"I said I didn’t technically."
"Ross";"Okay let’s put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.)"accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again)"accidentally" proposed to Rachel."
"Joey";"Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this(Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I don’t really know what that means. (Ross justlooks at him) You were saying?"
"Ross";"And I can even understand that you couldn’t tell Rachel, but whycouldn’t you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn’t."
"Joey";"I know I should’ve. (Makes quote marks again.) "I’msorry.""
"Ross";"Not using it right, Joe."
"Ross";"I’m gonna go."
"Joey";"No, come on Ross! (He grabs his bag so he can’t leave) Look, Ross, wehave to get past this."
"Ross";"Give me the bag."
"Joey";"No, look, I don’t know what else to do. I said I’m sorry!"
"Ross";"Joey!"
"Joey";"You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me."
"Ross";"I’m not gonna hit you."
"Joey";"Why not?  You’ll feel better!  I’ll feel better, andyou know you want to. I can see it in your eyes."
"Ross";"No I don’t."

"Ross";"You ducked!!"
"Joey";"I’m sorry! It was a reflex!"
"Ross";"Oh my god, this really hurts!!!"
"Joey";"I couldn’t help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!(He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn’t and Joey punches Ross.  Gunther is amused.)"
"Ross";"What is the matter with you?!?"
"Joey";"You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn’t you duck?"
"Ross";"Why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?"
"Joey";"Good, good yeah, (Grabs the bags) maybe while we’re there, they cancheck your reflexes. (Joey opens the door and it hits Ross in the face with it.) (Makesquote marks.) "Oops.""
"Monica";"Try feeding her again."
"Rachel";"I already fed her."
"Monica";"I know, that’s why I said again!"
"Phoebe";"Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay? That’s just what she wants."

"Monica";"Excuse me?"
"Chandler";"Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me tomove to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently,said yes."

"Monica";"Chandler, I don’t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!"
"Chandler";"Really?"
"Monica";"Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma, or thatyou’re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a hugeraise?"
"Chandler";"No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monica’snot impressed.) I’ll get out of it."
"Monica";"Thank you."
"Chandler";"(hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?"
"Monica";"Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa."
"Chandler";"Umm ma’am, do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in)I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa."
"Ms. McKenna";"What?"
"Chandler";"It’s a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep inthe meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really knowwhat I was saying."
"Ms. McKenna";"You fell asleep?"
"Chandler";"But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting,ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, here’s thething. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See, me, I loveTulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me gothere!"

"Ross";"I don’t think that we are."
"Joey";"But you two were supposed to be together."
"Ross";"Well, I thought so too, but then she said she’d marry you."
"Joey";"Come on, Ross, that didn’t mean anything! She just had the baby, shewas all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody."
"Ross";"Yeah that’s what she said."
"Joey";"So?"
"Ross";"So I don’t wanna be just anybody."
"Joey";"Wow."
"Ross";"You know what, it’s, it’s better this way anyway. I mean Idon’t know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It’s justmuch easier if we’re just friends who have a kid."

"Ross";"Yeah."
"Joey";"And you’re Okay with that?"
"Ross";"Yes. I mean, it’s what we always planned.  And if you have aplan, you should stick to it.  That’s why they call them plans.  Hello?(Pause) I’m fine."

"Monica";"About a week and a half."
"Phoebe";"Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I’mjust gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her, upset, and Monica just stares.) No!Really? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)"
"Monica";"Rach, try holding her a different way."
"Rachel";"You guys, I’m doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try."
"Phoebe";"Alright, I’ll try, fine! Yes, Okay!"
"Rachel";"Here you go. (Hands Emma to Phoebe)"
"Phoebe";"Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.)"
"Rachel";"Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can’t even comfort my ownbaby! I’m the worst mother ever!"
"Monica";"You’re just new at this, it’ll get better, think about yourfirst day at work. I mean, that couldn’t have been easy but you figured that out."
"Rachel";"Yeah I don’t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here!Oh my god just please take her."
"Monica";"Okay I’ll take her, here. (Takes Emma)"
"Rachel";"I have to go to the bathroom. (Goes to the bathroom)"
"Phoebe";"I have to go scream into a pillow. (Goes to scream into a pillow)"
"Monica";"(To Emma) Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Oohbaby baby. (Emma stops crying and falls asleep)"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Have I gone deaf?"
"Monica";"It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!"
"Phoebe";"You must be a fireball in bed."
"Monica";"I can’t believe it!  She’s asleep!  I got her to goto sleep!   I have actual magical powers!"
"Phoebe";"I can hear traffic and birds!  I can hear the voices in my headagain! (Monica looks at her strangely) I’m kidding. (She smiles wickedly.)"
"Rachel";"Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!"
"Monica";"Yes I did, I’m Monica, Super Aunt"
"Rachel";"You are the official baby crier stopper!"
"Monica";"Yes I am!!"
"Rachel";"You’re never leaving the apartment!"
"Monica";"Say what?"
"Rachel";"That’s your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need youhere."
"Monica";"(stands up to hand Emma back) Oh no no no no!"
"Phoebe";"Thankfully you don’t need me at all (gets up and to leave) so OkaySuper aunt see you later! Rachel let’s give it six to eight months (she leaves)."
"Rachel";"Okay so listen I’m gonna go lay down."
"Monica";"What?"
"Rachel";"You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should besleeping so… (She gives Monica thumbs and goes to lay down)"
"Chandler";"(entering, loudly) Hey!"
"Monica";"Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep"
"Chandler";"Oh so there can’t be any yelling."
"Monica";"No."
"Chandler";"We’re moving to Tulsa"
"Monica";"(loudly) What!?"
"Chandler";"Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) Ican’t, I can’t hear you. (He runs out)"

"Ross";"Well, that’s what I’m here for. (Emma starts crying again) Wantme to get that?"
"Rachel";"No its really okay… Monica!"
"Monica";"(comes running out the kitchen to the bedroom) Got it! Got it! Got it!Got it! Got it! Got it!"
"Joey";"You know, ah, I’ve been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya,it’s not my fault. It’s a natural instinct."
"Chandler";"(enters) Hey, what you guys talking about?"
"Joey";"Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this? (Swings to punch Chandler,he moves and he ends up punching Ross, knocking him off the stool. Ross then gets up andjust stares at Joey.)"
"that";"that"
"some";"some"
"was";"was"
"Phoebe";"...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;"
"Joey";"(impressed) Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?"
"Phoebe";"(smiling) Uh-huh."
"Chandler";"(coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa."
"Monica";"I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas."
"Ross";"You're really not coming back?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired."
"Monica";"It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!"
"Chandler";"So, who does?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I like my job."
"Joey";"I *love* my job."
"Rachel";"Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work."
"Ross";"I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!"
"Chandler";"I'm sorry, I won't be here."
"Monica";"It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand."
"Chandler";"Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you New Year's Day."
"Monica";"(shocked) You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??"
"Chandler";"Did I not mention that?"
"Monica";"No!"
"Chandler";"(thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:) AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! (and runs out of the apartment)"
"Chandler";"All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call (he takes it off) for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler."
"Wendy";"Hey!"
"Others";"Hey."
"Chandler";"Hey. Where've you been?"
"Wendy";"I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham. (She turns the cardboard box upside down over the conference table, a big piece of ham falls out.)"
"Chandler";"(to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here."
"Claudia";"My kid's in a play right now."
"Chandler";"Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order."
"Ken";"(reading off his card) "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet"."
"Chandler";"Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!"
"Wendy";"*Now* it feels like Christmas."
"Chandler";"I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to."
"Ken";"You can come to my house!"
"Chandler";"Haha, no thanks!"
"Wendy";"That was a nice pep-talk."
"Chandler";"Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker."
"Wendy";"So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?"
"Chandler";"Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional..."
"Phoebe";"So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. (singing:)"
"Rachel";"Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet."
"Chandler";"I can save you time ladies, I'm right here."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you."
"Rachel";"We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica."
"Chandler";"What? That's terrible!"
"Phoebe";"No-no, we do it every year!"
"Chandler";"Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible."
"Phoebe";"No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx."
"Rachel";"Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?"
"Chandler";"No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!"
"Phoebe";"Oh no, we have to!"
"Chandler";"No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too."
"Phoebe";"Well then, you should look with us."
"Chandler";"Why?"
"Rachel";"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?"
"Chandler";"No, I have a great idea for a present for her."
"Phoebe";"Oh, that's it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea! Oh yeah."
"Rachel";"Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?"
"Chandler";"If I help, we can find 'em faster!"
"Rachel";"That's right!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh ooh, we have a live one!"
"Rachel";"Oh, it's a Macy's bag!"
"Rachel";"Oh."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, who's it for?"
"Rachel";"(Reading from a tag that's attached to the shoe) "Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you.""
"Joey";"Rach, these are for you."
"Rachel";"Wiper blades. I don't even have a car."
"Joey";"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
"Chandler";"OK, Pheebs, your turn."
"Phoebe";"Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?"
"Joey";"Uh-huh."
"Phoebe";"You guuuyys."
"Joey";"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth."
"Ross";"You got me a cola drink?"
"Chandler";"And, a lemon lime."
"Ross";"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater."
"Chandler";"And last but not least."
"Joey";"They're ribbed for *your* pleasure."
"Ross";"Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?"
"Ross";"Yeah!"
"Monica";"Come on Ben."
"Ross";"Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees..."
"Chandler";"(entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!"
"Chandler";"Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)"
"Ross";"What are you doing here, Santa?"
"Chandler";"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?"
"Ross";"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Monica";"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say."
"Ross";"(to Chandler) What are you doing?"
"Chandler";"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
"Ross";"Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave."
"Chandler";"Why?"
"Ross";"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it."
"Chandler";"But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly."
"Ross";"I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me."
"Chandler";"Fine, I'll give the suit back."
"Monica";"(to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)"
"Chandler";"Santa? Really?"
"Monica";"Yeah, is that okay?"
"Chandler";"Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?"
"Monica";"No."
"Chandler";"Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.)"
"Chandler";"You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve."
"Chandler";"Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go."
"Chandler";"Good, God's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees Wendy) You're not gonna go?"
"Wendy";"Naah... I couldn't leave you alone."
"Chandler";"Ah. Thanks."
"Wendy";"Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham."
"Chandler";"Ah. (The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing."
"Monica";"Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas."
"Others";"(simultaneously) Merry Christmas! (except for Phoebe...)"
"Phoebe";"(simultaneous to the others) Ble-blah-blar Blargh!"
"Chandler";"Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!"
"Monica";"So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?"
"Chandler";"Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy."
"Monica";"Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name."
"Chandler";"It is. Did I... not tell you about her?"
"Monica";"Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?"
"Chandler";"I sent them home."
"Monica";"Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?"
"Chandler";"Uhh, uh..."
"Ross";"(in a low voice) Answer faster, answer faster!"
"Chandler";"I don't know!"
"Ross";"(in the same low voice) Answer better, answer better!"
"Chandler";"I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague."
"Monica";"What does she do there?"
"Chandler";"Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me."
"Monica";"She did WHAT?"
"Chandler";"BE-LOW me!"
"Joey";"Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?"
"Monica";"*What*??"
"Chandler";"Well, she... she didn't win..."
"Monica";"Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work."
"Chandler";"Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably..."
"Rachel";"(interrupting him) Oh Chandler, stop talking!"
"Chandler";"Honey, there's really nothing to worry about."
"Monica";"Okay."
"Chandler";"I'm serious!"
"Monica";"Okay!"
"Chandler";"Merry Christmas."
"Monica";"Merry Christmas."
"Chandler";"Merry Christmas, you guys!"
"Others";"(simultaneously) Yeah, Merry... Christmas. (again, Phoebe...)"
"Phoebe";"(simultaneous to the others) Blah blargah, blar-blab."
"Chandler";"(hanging up the phone) The wife says "Hi!"."
"Wendy";"Ah. Fun conversation?"
"Chandler";"Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen."
"Wendy";"Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible? (She gets hold of Chandler's tie, slowly moving her hands upwards on the tie, getting closer and closer to him, seductive.)"
"Chandler";"This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie."
"Chandler";"Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! (He takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)"
"Wendy";"(laughs) ...Missy?"
"Chandler";"I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?"
"Wendy";"You are to me... (She gets closer again, putting her arms around his torso.)"
"Chandler";"(flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.) Look, I'm, I'm married!"
"Wendy";"So? I'm married. (Showing him the ring on her finger.)"
"Chandler";"I'm *happily* married."
"Wendy";"Oh. - What's *that* like?"
"Chandler";"Right. So, I'm sorry..."
"Wendy";"Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?"
"Chandler";"Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us."
"Wendy";"Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?"
"Chandler";"I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!"
"Monica";"Really?"
"Chandler";"You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?"
"Monica";"Well, not anymore."
"Chandler";"But we don't do that."
"Monica";"I know, I just thought it would be fun."
"Chandler";"How drunk are you?"
"Monica";"Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage."
"Chandler";"(thinks) That's the perfect amount!"
"Monica";"Okay!"
"Monica";"(breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?"
"Chandler";"What?"
"Monica";"This doesn't feel weird!"
"Chandler";"I know."
"Monica";"You're a really good kisser."
"Chandler";"Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?"
"Monica";"Hm-hmm!"
"Chandler";"Okay!"
"Monica";"Wow! You are really fast!"
"Chandler";"It bodes well for me that speed impresses you."
"Monica";"We're gonna see each other naked."
"Chandler";"Yep!"
"Monica";"Do you wanna do it at the same time?"
"Chandler";"Count of three?"
"Monica";"One!"
"Chandler";"Two!"
"Monica";"Two!"
"Both";"Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)"
"Chandler";"Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined."
"Monica";"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!"
"Chandler";"Eh! (They start making out again)"
"Chandler";"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
"Monica";"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him."
"Chandler";"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this."
"Monica";"I think you're better than you think you are."
"Chandler";"Really? Okay, so..."
"Monica";"(interrupting) Know when to stop."
"Chandler";"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
"Monica";"Yeah. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around:) Don't do the dance."
"Chandler";"Right!"
"Monica";"I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue."
"Chandler";"Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
"Monica";"You're so efficient. I love you!"
"Chandler";"Let's go! (Starts to leave.)"
"Monica";"No-no-no, wait! We need something old!"
"Chandler";"Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve."
"Monica";"That'll work!"
"Chandler";"I don't think so."
"Monica";"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
"Chandler";"(looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)"
"Monica";"That's stealing!"
"Chandler";"No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress."
"Monica";"Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)"
"Chandler";"Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)"
"Monica";"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that."
"Chandler";"Ehh."
"Monica";"Eh, you work for that."
"Chandler";"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
"Monica";"You do?!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do."
"Monica";"Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?"
"Chandler";"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
"Monica";"You thought about that?"
"Chandler";"Yeah."
"Monica";"How many kids were we gonna have?"
"Chandler";"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
"Monica";"What else did you think about?"
"Chandler";"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old."
"Monica";"(laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding."
"Chandler";"Sure you do."
"Monica";"No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage."
"Chandler";"You sure?"
"Monica";"Uh-hmm."
"Chandler";"I love you so much."
"Monica";"I love you. (They kiss.)"
"Rachel";"(opens her present from Ross; it's a dark-red scarf) Oohh, I love it!"
"Ross";"Really? You're not gonna return it?"
"Rachel";"Well, not this second!"
"Phoebe";"(at the window) Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!"
"Rachel";"Oh wow, it's so beautiful..."
"Ross";"Wow, it really is!"
"Monica";""Wendy" is a fat girl name."
"Phoebe";"Aren't we done with that?"
"Monica";"Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Oh my god..."
"Joey";"Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!"
"Monica";"What are you doing here?"
"Chandler";"I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much."
"Joey";"Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?"
"Chandler";"Monica."
"Joey";"Got ya. (blinks an eye)"
"Chandler";"I never want to leave you again!"
"Monica";"But I thought if you left, you get fired."
"Chandler";"Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit."
"Monica";"What?"
"Ross";"What, you, you really quit your job?"
"Chandler";"Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?"
"Rachel";"What do you really want to do?"
"Chandler";"(realizing) I have *not* thought this through!"
"Monica";"Oh my god!"
"Chandler";"I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it."
"Monica";"No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!"
"Chandler";"Thanks!"
"Phoebe";"Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined."
"Chandler";"(flattered) Ahh..."
"Phoebe";"Now give me my real gift."
"Phoebe";"(to Chandler) Thank you."
"Chandler";"(to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)"
"Ross";"Oh, hey..."
"Ross";"(reading off his card) "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?"
"Rachel";"Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this."
"Chandler";"I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys."
"Joey";"Mine's is to Lilian Myers."
"Chandler";"I don't have a *job*!"
"Chandler";"Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica:) Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!"
"Monica";"You are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to Chandler) Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?"
"Chandler";"Hey"
"Joey";"Hey. So where's Mon?"
"Chandler";"Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight."
"Joey";"And you're not helping?"
"Chandler";"I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice   - not helping."
"Ross";"Hey you guys!"
"Joey and Chandler";"(start to sing) Hey! Happy birthday ..."
"Rachel";"Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me."
"Ross";"Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly (points   to Molly). Molly, Chandler, Joey."
"Joey and Chandler";"Hi."
"Molly";"Hi."
"Ross";"Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy."
"Joey";"You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes."
"Rachel";"Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside."
"Molly";"No, you stay, I'll do it (takes Emma from Rachel)."
"Rachel";"OK, thank you."
"Molly";"Nice to meet you guys (to Chandler and Joey)."
"Joey";"Yeah, you too."
"Rachel";"Oh, wow, Molly is just great!"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny."
"Rachel";"What? You really think she's hot?"
"Chandler";"Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now."
"Rachel";"And Joey?"
"Joey";"How do you think she's doing?"
"Rachel";"Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?"
"Ross";"Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ...."
"Rachel";"Thank you! (goes to get coffee)"
"Chandler";"Now that Rachel's gone?"
"Rachel";"So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. (Joey and Chandler clap their   hands)"
"Phoebe";"Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?"
"Mike";"Lima."
"Phoebe";"No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully   with a "to" in the middle."
"Mike";"You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox".   (opens the kitchen cabinet) Oh god! Oh!"
"Phoebe";"What?"
"Mike";"OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a   rat in your cupboard."
"Phoebe";"(relived) Oh, whew, no, that's Bob."
"Mike";"What, is he your pet rat?"
"Phoebe";"Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who   I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on   the plate of cookies."
"Mike";"You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary,   and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus."
"Phoebe";"What are those?"
"Mike";"I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get   rid of it!"
"Phoebe";"OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob."
"Mike";"Thank you."
"Phoebe";"So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.   (Mike throws out everything in his mouth)"
"Rachel";"Hello."
"Gavin";"Hello"
"Rachel";"Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma   yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology."
"Gavin";"For what?"
"Rachel";"Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous   and arrogant and obnoxious ..."
"Gavin";"Is this your first appology?"
"Rachel";"No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And   I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you."
"Heather";"Good morning!"
"Rachel";"Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf,   I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry,   obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait   'till it's finished."
"Gavin";"What?"
"Rachel";"I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!"
"Gavin";"I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her   skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area."
"Rachel";"Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep."
"Gavin";"Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at   my ass". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just   think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your   subordinate."
"Gavin";"I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag."
"Rachel";"That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know   that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had   a deap meaningful relationship."
"Gavin";"Huh. What's Tag's last name?"
"Rachel";"It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last   name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses."
"Gavin";"But it was a deap meaningful relationship."
"Rachel";"Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely   right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name   was Morgan! Huh!"
"Gavin";"It was Jones."
"Rachel";"Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?"
"Joey";"Man, I wish I had a nanny like you."
"Molly";"You mean, when you were a baby."
"Joey";"Sure."
"Monica";"Would you stop staring at her?"
"Chandler";"I wasn't staring. I was leering."
"Monica";"What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind   of way."
"Ross";"Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there   in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me   feel like I earned it."
"Chandler";"Looks like Joey is doing allright with her."
"Monica";"Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl   for once."
"Molly";"(to Ross) I'm gonna take her back to the appartment."
"Ross";"Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you   - wovyou dovyou ..."
"Molly";"Bye"
"Monica";"They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good."
"Molly";"I think it's sweet. (goes to leave)"
"Ross, Joey and Chandler";"Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma."
"Rachel";"(to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if   you didn't go after her."
"Joey";"Why not?"
"Rachel";"Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything   to, you know, drive her away."
"Joey";"So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call   her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds   about right."
"Ross";"Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just   forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits."
"Joey";"Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told   me I can't have it makes me want her even more!"
"Ross";"What are you, a child?"
"Joey";"Yes!"
"Ross";"Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy   on someone else."
"Joey";"Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)"
"Monica";"(to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)"
"Phoebe";"Hey Mikey"
"Mike";"Hey P"
"Phoebe";"What are you doing?"
"Mike";"Setting rat traps."
"Phoebe";"To kill Bob??"
"Mike";"No, no, to test his neck strength."
"Phoebe";"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna   capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can   maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl."
"Mike";"Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps."
"Phoebe";"I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! (looks at   cabinet under sink) Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies!   Bob's a mom!"
"Mike";"Better think of a new name for him."
"Phoebe";"I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl."
"Mike";"I don't know, I mean I'm not sure (they hear cracking voice from   somewhere else in the kitchen, probably a rat caught in a trap) ..."
"Phoebe";"Oh my god, we killed Bob!"
"Mike";"Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse."
"Phoebe";"Suzie? (Runs over there to check)"
"Ross";"Whazzup??"
"Chandler";"Seriously dude, 3 years ago."
"Ross";"Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep   an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?"
"Chandler";"You don't trust him?"
"Ross";"Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked   for her daughter, the "hot nanny"."
"Chandler";"Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference?   Because I could get a job any day now."
"Ross";"You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm   sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do   this for me?"
"Chandler";"Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know   as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not,   he's going to have sex with it."
"Ross";"Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. (pause)"
"Chandler";"Picturing that tree?"
"Ross";"I am, yes."
"Chandler";"Where you going, Joe?"
"Joey";"For a walk."
"Chandler";"Oh. You mind if I join you?"
"Joey";"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize   my thoughts."
"Chandler";"Your thoughts? Plural?"
"Joey";"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta   see her!"
"Chandler";"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe."
"Joey";"Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me!   She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable   boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over   there?"
"Chandler";"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go."
"Joey";"Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the   world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of."
"Chandler";"Great novels?"
"Joey";"Fine ... mediocre porn"
"Gavin";"Gavin Mitchelle's office."
"Rachel";"Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone)   Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll   pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)"
"Gavin";"Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary. (Rachel is upset)"
"Rachel";"Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you."
"Gavin";"Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah. (hangs up) (to Rachel) Yes?"
"Rachel";"If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?"
"Gavin";"Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your   pad three hours ago. (Rachel throws away that paper) Man, I really bug you,   don't I?"
"Rachel";"Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact,   from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to   you, you "momma's boy", starting right now."
"Monica";"Hey Rach!"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Monica";"Ready for your birthday lunch?"
"Rachel";"Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce   you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin   Mitchelle."
"Gavin";"Pleased to meet you."
"Monica";"Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?"
"Rachel";"Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his   mother."
"Gavin";"Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.   (leaves)"
"Rachel";"Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!"
"Monica";"You were just being so nice to him!"
"Rachel";"I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?"
"Rachel";"Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!"
"Monica";"Right there! That was so fake!"
"Rachel";"Shh!"
"Rachel";"(to Monica) I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the   last person I want to see."
"Monica";"Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time."
"Rachel";"God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy   hates me."
"Monica";"Does he?"
"Rachel";"What?"
"Monica";"Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first   grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly   had a crush on me?"
"Rachel";"Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet   to see if he can knock you over."
"Molly";"(with Emma in a basinet) She's out, I'm gonna take her home."
"Rachel";"Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what all the guys   see in her?"
"Monica";"Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! (put her glass down)"
"Joey";"Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, sure!"
"Joey";"Oh ... (Starts to sing) Happy birth ... (sees Molly leaving) oh, see you   later (runs after Molly)"
"Monica";"Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!"
"Rachel";"Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the   box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)"
"Phoebe";"Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!"
"Mike";"Yeah. We have rat babies now."
"Rachel";"Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?"
"Monica";"So this is what a stroke feels like."
"Phoebe";"I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility   now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're   a mother."
"Rachel";"Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?"
"Phoebe";"No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed   them."
"Rachel";"whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?"
"Phoebe";"Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone   can afford help. (she and Mike leave)"
"Ross";"Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them."
"Chandler";"(In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I'm sorry, I got a little occupied."
"Ross";"We have to stop them before something happens!"
"Chandler";"(still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the   door)"
"Joey";"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline.   It takes a lot of hard work."
"Molly";"So where did you study?"
"Joey";"Oh, I didn't go to college."
"Molly";"No, where did you study acting?"
"Joey";"Molly ... people don't study acting ..."
"Ross";"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?"
"Molly";"Sure, I'll go check on Emma."
"Ross";"Thanx."
"Joey";"(upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess??"
"Ross";"What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?"
"Joey";"No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair.   What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?   Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,   and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this   way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again."
"Ross and Chandler";"Come on! Joe!"
"Joey";"Ok (admits)"
"Woman";"Hi, is Molly here?"
"Ross";"Yeah, come on in. Molly?"
"Molly";"(goes out of the room) Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha (they kiss on the lips   in a romantic way). (to Ross) I'll see you tomorrow."
"Ross";"Ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have   no problem."
"Joey";"It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at him) The   princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!"
"Phoebe";"Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing   the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed."
"Mike";"Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve   around their rats?"
"Phoebe";"Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now."
"Mike";"Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate   and there are hundreds of them?"
"Phoebe";"Mate? They're all brothers and sisters."
"Mike";"Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love   the one you're with" kind of animals."
"Phoebe";"No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what   are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then   each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... (starts counting with her fingers)   That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?"
"Mike";"Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let   the box of rats ruin our lives."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away.   But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's   favorites."
"Mike";"It's gonna be ok."
"Phoebe";"You must think I'm crazy."
"Mike";"No, I think you're sweet."
"Phoebe";"Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go.   I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to   my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven't   told you about that yet, have I?"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?"
"Monica";"No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over."
"Monica";"Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from   your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows)."
"Rachel";"Mmm hmm."
"Gavin";"Yeah, hey. (comes in to the balcony)"
"Monica";"Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover."
"Rachel";"No."
"Gavin";"Nice party."
"Rachel";"Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at (looks   at his watch) ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ..."
"Monica";"(from inside) Again, you're welcome."
"Gavin";"Look, I'll just give you this and go."
"Rachel";"Oh, you bought me a present! Why?"
"Gavin";"Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There   are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you   the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier."
"Rachel";"Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card (opens   the card). "From Gavin""
"Gavin";"I really mean it."
"Rachel";"(opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful."
"Gavin";"You don't mind? (puts it around her neck) Well, what do you know, it fits!"
"Rachel";"See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such   a hard time?"
"Gavin";"I'm not sure."
"Rachel";"Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me."
"Gavin";"I do have feelings for you."
"Rachel";"You do?"
"Gavin";"Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying."
"Rachel";"See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion   of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)"
"Chandler";"(sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid, I was petrified (very happy)"
"Phoebe";"(walks in) Hey"
"Chandler";"(normal voice) Hi"
"Phoebe";"Listen, I think I've left something here."
"Chandler";"Oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is yours?"
"Phoebe";"(likes the jacket) No, but I like it. I think I left one of   my rat babies."
"Chandler";"Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know."
"Monica";"Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! (screams from another room)"
"Phoebe";"(realizes) Ooh, maybe that's him!"
"Chandler";": Hey!"
"Ross";"Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?"
"Chandler";": Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever"
"Ross";"OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?"
"Chandler";": No!"
"Ross";"OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony."
"Chandler";": Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said"
"Ross";"Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,"
"Chandler";": So are you gonna...talk to her?"
"Ross";"Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!"
"Chandler";": You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!"
"Ross";"No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know"
"Chandler";": No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?"
"Ross";"I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me."
"Chandler";": Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!"
"Ross";"Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental"
"Chandler";": Why did I get married?!"
"Joey";": Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I"
"Phoebe";": Well it depends."
"Joey";": On...?"
"Phoebe";": On how far along he's in the sex change process!"
"Monica";": No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,"
"Joey";": Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!"
"Phoebe";": Your knuckles are kinda hairy too..."
"Joey";": Oh man! I have to get those done too?!"
"Phoebe";": Wow! Talking about high maintenance"
"Joey";": Hey hey! You dye your hair!"
"Phoebe";": I'm a woman!"
"Joey";": Arghhh! Double standards!"
"Phoebe";": Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?"
"Monica";": Only if I don't have to get up and sing."
"Phoebe";": But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out"
"Monica";": It's just, I'm not good at singing."
"Phoebe";": Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?"
"Monica";": No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!"
"Phoebe";": OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing."
"Monica";": So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?"
"Phoebe";": While drinking..."
"Monica";": I'm there!"
"Rachel";": Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid."
"Phoebe";": Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there"
"Rachel";": No not that. I kissed Gavin last night."
"Phoebe";": Oh my god."
"Monica";": You kissed him?"
"Rachel";": Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and..."
"Monica";": Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?"
"Phoebe";": It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper."
"Monica";": Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?"
"Rachel";": You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf..."
"Monica";": I thought you hated him?"
"Rachel";": You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!"
"Monica";": So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?"
"Rachel";": I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't"
"Monica";": Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross"
"Rachel";": Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all..."
"Phoebe";": Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!"
"Salon girl";": Hi"
"Joey";": Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment."
"Salon girl";"Name?"
"Joey";"Chandler Bing."
"Salon girl";"Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you."
"Joey";": OK Thanks."
"Sonia";": I'll take care of it"
"Joey";": Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?"
"Sonia";": Oh absolutely."
"Joey";": Oh good..."
"Sonia";": Are you looking to meet somebody?"
"Joey";": All right let's just do this."
"Sonia";": We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit..."
"Joey";": Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!"
"Chandler";": Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?"
"Ross";"Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants."
"Chandler";": Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,"
"Ross";"That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?"
"Chandler";": What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!"
"Ross";"I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me"
"Chandler";": Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing"
"Ross";"No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar."
"Chandler";": Did she go out with him?"
"Ross";"No. When he called, I...I threw the message away."
"Chandler";": Ah! The high road..."
"Ross";"You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!"
"Chandler";": Are you trying to get everybody divorced?"
"Ross";": You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the"
"Chandler";": I thought I had to make the jokes!"
"Ross";"Don't you have to be at work?"
"Chandler";": Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it."
"Ross";"Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here�s a question: "Would you..."
"Blonde girl";": Sorry...we were just leaving"
"Chandler";": We still got it!"
"Rachel";": Who is it?"
"Gavin";": Gavin! I brought you some soup."
"Rachel";": Why?"
"Gavin";": I heard you were sick..."
"Rachel";": Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin"
"Gavin";": I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?"
"Rachel";": I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick"
"Gavin";": Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me."
"Rachel";": Oh no no no"
"Gavin";": So I had fun last night"
"Rachel";": So did I"
"Gavin";": Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?"
"Rachel";": It's just a cold"
"Gavin";": Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum..."
"Rachel";": What? What's the matter?"
"Gavin";": What's Ross doing to you on that picture?"
"Rachel";": Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny."
"Gavin";": Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything"
"Rachel";": Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really."
"Gavin";": Yeah! But you said not to worry about..."
"Rachel";": I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!"
"Molly";": Hi!"
"Rachel";": Oh! Molly! You're not Ross."
"Molly";": No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?"
"Rachel";": Right, right, yes!"
"Molly";": Don't panic!"
"Rachel";": What?"
"Molly";": There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse."
"Rachel";": No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly."
"Gavin";": Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there."
"Molly";": Hello! I just go and get Emma."
"Rachel";": OK."
"Gavin";": So hum...Why did I have to hide?"
"Rachel";": I thought it was Ross."
"Gavin";": So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two..."
"Rachel";": There isn't. There is totally isn't."
"Gavin";": You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be a"
"Rachel";": All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in"
"Gavin";": It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a piece of advice?"
"Rachel";": Yes"
"Gavin";": I think you should talk to Ross about all this."
"Rachel";": People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin"
"Gavin";": Don't be. It's just bad timing."
"Rachel";": So seriously...rodeo clown?"
"Gavin";": One of the best, ma'am, one of the best..."
"Phoebe";": "No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you!"
"Mike";": Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to get a break and when we come back we've got Kenneth"
"Phoebe";": Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing."
"Monica";": No I told you I can't."
"Phoebe";": But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice."
"Monica";": What have you heard me sing?"
"Phoebe";": All the time when you're cooking."
"Monica";": What?"
"Phoebe";": Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy""
"Monica";": Yeah I do rock that one."
"Phoebe";": OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?"
"Monica";": Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing..."
"Mike";": Well I've got a book around..."
"Monica";": "Delta Dawn""
"Ross";"Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace"
"Woman";": You already hit on me an hour ago"
"Ross";"Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out."
"Chandler";": I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed"
"Ross";"This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone."
"Chandler";": By drowning or...?!"
"Michelle";": Why would he break up with me?"
"Her friend";": I don't know sweetie."
"Michelle";": All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. I mean, am I so unlovable?"
"Chandler";": Well..."
"Ross";"I know! (he stands)"
"Mike";": All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of "I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monica"
"Monica";": Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people."
"Phoebe";": Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone"
"Monica";": Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn""
"Phoebe";": Can you totally see through her shirt ?"
"Mike";": Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra."
"Monica";": "To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?""
"Joey";": Hey, I need your help."
"Chandler";": Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?"
"Joey";": Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped"
"Chandler";": I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!"
"Joey";": You may be a sissy but I'll still (pound you out on ground). All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one"
"Chandler";": It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!"
"Joey";": All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so"
"Chandler";": Ok. First of all, this is green!"
"Joey";": What the hell am I supposed to do!"
"Chandler";": All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you."
"Joey";": What, what."
"Chandler";": Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine"
"Joey";": Oh my God!"
"Chandler";": Yeah, well, I guess you don�t need my help Victor Victoria!"
"Joey";": Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don�t know if I can take anymore"
"Chandler";": Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch."
"Monica";": "Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?"
"Phoebe";": Every little bit of you!"
"Monica";": I can�t believe I did this. I can�t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that"
"Mike";": Sure."
"Phoebe";": Mon', not that you didn�t sound good, but..."
"Monica";": Good? Didn�t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That�s is the best gift ever."
"Mike";": Also a good gift? Underwear."
"Michelle";": Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do"
"Ross";"But, what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it."
"Michelle";": It�s so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with me, because it�s like you lose a boyfriend,"
"Ross";"Uh-ah!"
"Michelle";": No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric."
"Ross";"(pfew). Good choice Ross."
"Rachel";": Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I�ve been looking for you everywhere!"
"Ross";"Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am."
"Rachel";": Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o� clock. So I was hoping you and I could have a"
"Ross";"Oh, yeah, yeah that�s Michelle."
"Rachel";": Who?"
"Ross";"Oh, just this woman I�ve been seeing."
"Rachel";": You�ve being seeing someone?"
"Ross";"Yeah, didn�t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven�t being going out for too long, but rather there is this"
"Michelle";": What are you taking amoxicillin for?"
"Ross";"How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that�s"
"Rachel";": Hi, and I am also Emma�s mother."
"Michelle";": Ah, who is Emma?"
"Ross";"I told you about my daughter."
"Michelle";": This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!"
"Chandler";": And done!"
"Joey";": Oh my God! I didn�t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around"
"Chandler";": Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?"
"Joey";": Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!"
"Chandler";": Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about"
"Joey";": Thank you so much."
"Chandler";": No problem."
"Joey";": Listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it."
"Chandler";": Yeah."
"Joey";": Comb my eyelashes."
"Monica";": Ok, for my next song I think I�ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer"
"Phoebe";": Oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands."
"Chandler";": I am sorry I am late. You�ll understand when you�ll see Joey."
"Monica";": Honey, you�re just in time, I�m about to sing another song!"
"Chandler";": Really? In front of all this people?"
"Monica";": And they love me!"
"Chandler";": Oh my God!"
"Phoebe";": Yes, she gives the people what they want."
"Monica";": All right, watch!"
"Monica";": "Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this"
"Chandler";": Are those my wife�s nipples?"
"Phoebe";": Oh? Isn�t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again."
"Chandler";": I gotta stop this."
"Monica";": Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited...""
"Chandler";": You, touching yourself, out!"
"Rachel";": Wow. She does that a lot!"
"Michelle";": Ross, you didn�t tell me you were a doctor!"
"Rachel";": What, what, wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like"
"Michelle";": Actually about an hour and a half."
"Ross";"I told you it wasn�t long, but there is an amazing connection between us."
"Michelle";": You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!"
"Ross";"Are you kidding?"
"Michelle";": Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?"
"Ross";"We�ll see."
"Rachel";": Ok, Ross, what�s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?"
"Ross";"I don�t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?"
"Rachel";": How do you know about that?"
"Ross";"Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep..."
"Michelle";": Emma."
"Ross";"When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?"
"Rachel";": Oh, that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?"
"Michelle";": No, actually, see I had to pee, �cause I can�t use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites."
"Ross";"Ok, Michelle, it�s time to go."
"Michelle";": Well, call me!"
"Ross";"Ok."
"Michelle";": No, wait, you don�t have my phone number!"
"Ross";"You know, if it�s meant to be, I�ll guess it. Bye, bye."
"Rachel";": Score."
"Ross";"Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on"
"Rachel";": Oh God, I can�t believe you�re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!"
"Ross";"Oh, really!"
"Rachel";": Yeah."
"Ross";"Oh, really!"
"Rachel";": Oh yeah."
"Ross";": What about the guy from the bar?"
"Rachel";": What? Who?"
"Ross";"The guy you gave your number to."
"Rachel";": Whoa, how do you know about that?"
"Ross";"Because he called here looking for you. So don�t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,"
"Rachel";": Why didn�t I get that message?"
"Ross";"What?"
"Rachel";": From the guy in the bar, why didn�t I get that message?"
"Ross";"Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?"
"Rachel";": Ross?"
"Ross";"I never gave it to you."
"Rachel";": Why?"
"Ross";"I don�t know."
"Rachel";": Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?"
"Ross";"Who am I?"
"Rachel";": Yes."
"Ross";"I am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars meeting guys!"
"Rachel";": Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you"
"Ross";"None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That�s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one"
"Rachel";": Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What�s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they"
"Ross";"Uh, clearly."
"Rachel";": And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,"
"Ross";"Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?"
"Joey";": Hey!"
"Rachel";": Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?"
"Joey";": Ha, oh, of course."
"Rachel";": Thank you."
"Joey";": Your eyebrows look weird."
"Chandler";": �Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped him"
"Joey";"Morning, roomie!"
"Rachel";"Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning."
"Joey";"Fifth day's a charm."
"Rachel";"Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're      making it so easy on me and Emma."
"Joey";"Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want,      and when does she stop crying all night?"
"Ross";"Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you      tonight?"
"Rachel";"Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's      in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep,      so..."
"Joey";"She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did      last night."
"Rachel";"Bye!"
"Ross";"Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you."
"Joey";"No, hey, it's been great."
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Joey";"Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying      here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?      And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using      a breast pump..."
"Ross";"Yeah, that'll do it."
"Joey";"Wow! So, how are you?"
"Ross";"I'm, I'm okay."
"Joey";"Really?"
"Ross";"Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have      worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's      a divorce."
"Joey";"Well, actually it..."
"Ross";"No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel      and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing      other people."
"Joey";"Wow, really?"
"Ross";"Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good      for me..."
"Joey";"Sure, I know lots of girls."
"Ross";"Yeah? Any names come to mind?"
"Joey";"Ooh, names?"
"Phoebe";"Hey."
"Joey";"Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?"
"Phoebe";"What you got?"
"Joey";"(checks the refrigerator): Okay, let's see, we got strained peas,      strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet."
"Phoebe";"Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart      from the great food."
"Joey";"I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with      her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody."
"Phoebe";"Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too."
"Joey";"Why are they doing this?"
"Phoebe";"I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy."
"Joey";"You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in      here?"
"Phoebe";"I just wish they'd realise they should be together."
"Joey";"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know,      that's where things were headed."
"Phoebe";"I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have      more children."
"Joey";"Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have      kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name."
"Phoebe";"You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's      out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other."
"Joey";"Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck!      But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom."
"Phoebe";"So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them      up with people?"
"Joey";"I know; that just pushes them further and further apart."
"Phoebe";"Yeah. (BEAT) Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel      up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together."
"Joey";"Ooh, that's a great plan!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh." (A      maniacal laugh follows.)"
"Joey";"Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh..."
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?"
"Chandler";"See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married?      I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll      excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries."
"Rachel";"I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight."
"Monica";"Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?"
"Rachel";"Well, Phoebe set me up on a date."
"Monica";"Oh my god."
"Chandler";"Wow."
"Rachel";"Why? What's the big deal?"
"Monica";"Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are..."
"Rachel";"What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set."
"Chandler";"Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I      mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!"
"Monica";"You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!"
"Rachel";"So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?"
"Monica";"Oh, it's perfect."
"Rachel";"Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age.      Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around      the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And      oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody      murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!"
"Chandler";"(reading the newspaper): Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, Joey."
"Joey";"Hey."
"Phoebe";"Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight."
"Joey";"All right! Who is he?"
"Phoebe";"Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold      down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me."
"Joey";"(gives a thumbs up sign): Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got      for Ross."
"Phoebe";"Oh, yeah."
"Joey";"She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!"
"Phoebe";"A teacher?"
"Joey";"Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh,      oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?"
"Phoebe";"Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey,      you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!"
"Joey";"Oh my god, you're right!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Joey";"She even reads for pleasure!"
"Phoebe";"How do you even know a woman like that?"
"Joey";"What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?"
"Phoebe";"Joey."
"Joey";"I met her at the library. I went in to pee."
"Phoebe";"So now what do we do?"
"Joey";"Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled,      and find him somebody else."
"Phoebe";"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the      date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets      stood up!"
"Joey";"Ooh...I hear that's bad."
"Phoebe";"Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross      gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together."
"Joey";"Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like      Santa Claus.)"
"Phoebe";"It's not Santa's plan. No, it's... (Laughs the real "plan-laugh.")"
"Joey";"Yeah, you know, it's not that fun."
"Phoebe";"No, I think we killed it."
"Chandler";"Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while."
"Chandler";"No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go.      Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!"
"Monica";"Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until      the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours."
"Chandler";"I don't do that."
"Chandler";"I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"Today is the sixth."
"Monica";"No, it's not."
"Chandler";"Yes, it's also 2003."
"Monica";"Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have      also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant."
"Chandler";"It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay."
"Monica";"Okay."
"Chandler";"Tough crib."
"Monica";"Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here."
"Chandler";"I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times."
"Monica";"Chandler!"
"Chandler";"I am not working. There's not much to do around here!"
"Ross";"Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height,      dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?"
"Waiter";"Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy."
"Ross";"Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me."
"Waiter";"Can I get you another glass of wine?"
"Ross";"Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home      alone."
"Waiter";"Got stood up, huh?"
"Ross";"Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date."
"Waiter";"Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?"
"Ross";"No!"
"Monica";"We're okay. I'm still ovulating."
"Chandler";"Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not."
"Monica";"So, let's do this."
"Chandler";"I - I don't think I can."
"Monica";"Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute."
"Chandler";"Because of Emma."
"Monica";"Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're      right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone."
"Chandler";"Sorry."
"Monica";"Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware      of at this age?"
"Chandler";"Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start...      canoodling in it."
"Monica";"Canoodling?"
"Chandler";"Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front      of the B-A-B-Y."
"Monica";"I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't      so..."
"Chandler";"Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?"
"Monica";"I guess you're right."
"Chandler";"You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you      wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through      the window."
"Monica";"But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?"
"Rachel";"Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken."
"Steve";"(staring at Rachel): I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful."
"Rachel";"Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you."
"Steve";"I'm kind of funny looking."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Steve";"Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows      it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with      him? He must be rich!" Well, I'm not!"
"Rachel";"(feeling awkward): So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really      excited about that chicken."
"Steve";"I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, "well, he's      not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs"... That ain't      gonna happen."
"Rachel";"Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now      wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant.      That's impressive."
"Steve";"I lost it. To drugs."
"Steve";"I silk-screen t-shirts now."
"Rachel";"Really? What's that like?"
"Steve";"It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's      right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with      two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile."
"Rachel";"(awkward chuckle): Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something      that you like about yourself."
"Steve";"I do like my hair."
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Phoebe";"Hello?"
"Rachel";"Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!"
"Phoebe";"Hey, Rach!"
"Rachel";"This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?"
"Phoebe";"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends."
"Rachel";"I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned."
"Rachel";"He's not stoned."
"Phoebe";"Did he go out for a cigarette?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, four times."
"Phoebe";"My dear, sweet Rach."
"Phoebe";"(to Joey): Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable      time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone."
"Joey";"Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together."
"Phoebe";"By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny      Mexico. (BEAT) Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan."
"Monica";"She's asleep. Chandler?"
"Monica";"What are you doing?"
"Chandler";"Emma was doing it!"
"Monica";"She's asleep."
"Chandler";"Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can..."
"Monica";"Yes, but we have to be fast."
"Chandler";"(laughs): Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise."
"Monica";"(laughs): Okay, I'll try."
"Joey";"Hello?"
"Joey";"Emma? Hey! Hi!"
"Joey";"How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the      bedroom door closed?"
"Joey";"You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!"
"Waiter";"I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left."
"Ross";"Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be."
"Waiter";"Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time.      Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on      the house."
"Ross";"Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to      have sex tonight."
"Waiter";"Ooh..."
"Ross";"Just the crab cakes."
"Waiter #2";"What are you      doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that."
"Waiter";"Just get out of here, okay?"
"Ross";"What's - what's going on?"
"Waiter";"Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on      how long it'll take before you give up and go home."
"Ross";"What? You - you're making money off my misery?"
"Waiter";"Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am."
"Ross";"This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life.      Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way."
"Monica";"Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast."
"Chandler";"I think we may have really done it this time."
"Monica";"Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test."
"Chandler";"You may wanna get some more of those too."
"Chandler";"Where's Emma?"
"Monica";"Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?"
"Chandler";"Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!"
"Monica";"Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma.      You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell."
"Chandler";"Okay. (Runs out.)"
"Monica";"Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another,      we're giving a baby back to Rachel."
"Steve";"(sobbing): I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must      think I'm so pathetic."
"Rachel";"No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry."
"Steve";"Really?"
"Rachel";"Don't touch my coat!"
"Rachel";"Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?"
"Monica";"(on phone): Hey, Rach, how's it going?"
"Rachel";"Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!"
"Rachel";"(to Steve): Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think      that this was going well? (To Monica.) What's up?"
"Monica";"Hey, did you stop by here?"
"Rachel";"No."
"Monica";"Oh my god, then..."
"Monica";"Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!"
"Rachel";"What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?"
"Monica";"Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just � she loves      it when I'm dramatic."
"Monica";"(to Joey): Why the hell did you take her?"
"Joey";"Because you two were having sex!"
"Monica";"No, we weren't!"
"Joey";"Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. (To Chandler.)      You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?"
"Chandler";"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's      ovulating."
"Joey";"Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in      the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this."
"Chandler";"No, no, no."
"Monica";"No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!"
"Joey";"Hey, I gotta! Unless..."
"Monica";"Unless what?"
"Joey";"Unless you name your firstborn child Joey."
"Chandler";"What? Why?"
"Joey";"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family      name."
"Chandler";"Your family name is Tribbiani."
"Joey";"(BEAT) (Laughs.) You almost had me."
"Rachel";"Well, uh..."
"Steve";"Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you      like to make love to me?"
"Rachel";"Really, really not."
"Steve";"Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway."
"Rachel";"All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve."
"Ross";"Hey, what's wrong?"
"Rachel";"I just had a rough night."
"Ross";"Oh. Crab cake?"
"Rachel";"Eww!"
"Ross";"Well, what happened?"
"Rachel";"Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but..."
"Ross";"Monica told me you had a blind date."
"Rachel";"Yeah."
"Ross";"I did, too."
"Rachel";"Oh."
"Ross";"But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?"
"Rachel";"Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?"
"Ross";"Why does everyone keep saying that?"
"Rachel";"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown      up."
"Ross";"That bad?"
"Rachel";"Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be      appropriate to give me this."
"Ross";"Female body inspector? What size is that?"
"Phoebe";"Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?"
"Joey";"Uh-huh."
"Phoebe";"How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?"
"Joey";"It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex."
"Phoebe";"Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes."
"Phoebe";"Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working."
"Phoebe";"Don't, don't do the plan-laugh."
"Ross";"The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters."
"Rachel";"Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would      set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you      up on a date that didn't even show."
"Ross";"Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's      just stupid."
"Joey";"We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really      bonding."
"Phoebe";"Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again."
"Phoebe";"Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out.      They're coming this way. Run!"
"Joey";"Where?"
"Phoebe";"Mexico!"
"Joey";"Can you believe they're still not here?"
"Ross";"I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the      chances?"
"Joey";"I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?"
"Waiter";"What?"
"Joey";"We've been stood up. (sniffles) And we want our free crab cakes."
"Waiter";"Guys, give it a rest. Nobody's betting on you tonight. Although we      do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry."
"Steve";"I have such fat hands!"
"Chandler";"Chandler"
"Chandler";"Hey! Ready to go?"
"Ross";"Oh yeah, let me just finish this."
"Joey";"Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!"
"Chandler";"What are you doin'?"
"Ross";"Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to."
"Chandler";"Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless ."
"Ross";"It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?"
"Chandler";"The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?"
"Ross";"Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident..."
"Chandler";"Bet she'd sleep with you now..."
"Ross";"No... I already e-mailed her."
"Chandler";"Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... " (pause) You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!"
"Ross";"You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat."
"Joey";"Hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)"
"Ross";"(he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)"
"Chandler";"Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on Ross' computer) "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!"
"Joey";"(he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!"
"Ross";"(he comes back) Alright, let's go!"
"Joey";"Dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands)"
"Ross";"I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!"
"Joey";"(after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button)"
"Rachel";"Hey! How was basketball?"
"Joey";"Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!"
"Rachel";"Oh, no! Who did that?"
"Joey";"Chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near Emma's cot) Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? (he looks puzzled)"
"Rachel";"She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?"
"Joey";"(still very puzzled) Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!"
"Rachel";"Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!"
"Joey";"Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount..."
"Rachel";"All right... Oh, Emma loves him!"
"Joey";"Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!"
"Phoebe";"Hi."
"Monica";"Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?"
"Phoebe";"Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!"
"Chandler";"Oh, I'm so sorry!"
"Phoebe";"Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this..."
"Chandler";"You're not gonna need my help?"
"Phoebe";"Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you."
"Chandler";"Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)"
"Phoebe";"Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that."
"Monica";"Ok, you got it!"
"Phoebe";"(after a pause) Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said."
"Monica";"Really? If that's what you want..."
"Phoebe";"That was a test and you just failed."
"Monica";"Damn it! Rookie mistake!"
"Ross";"(yelling at Chandler) I have sex with dinosaurs??"
"Chandler";"I believe I read that somewhere!"
"Ross";"That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  (pause) It's not funny!!"
"Chandler";"I respectfully disagree."
"Ross";"I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!"
"Chandler";"Who cares? Nobody reads those things"
"Ross";"You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today."
"Chandler";"I don't have a page."
"Ross";"Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!"
"Joey";"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...  with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up Hugsy) It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)"
"Rachel";"(threatening Joey with a scrunchy): Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!"
"Joey";"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy."
"Rachel";"What are you doing?"
"Joey";"Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy."
"Rachel";"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom."
"Joey";"(placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie...  (to Emma) This isn't over."
"Monica";"Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  (reads from the screen) "gay as the day is long"?"
"Chandler";"Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs."
"Monica";"But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. (Phone rings)"
"Chandler";"Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day."
"Monica";"(On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge."
"Chandler";"Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something)."
"Monica";"What are you doing?"
"Chandler";"Oh, you'll see my friend."
"Ross";"(visibly upset) I'm dead?"
"Chandler";"(faking sympathy) And so young."
"Ross";"Posting that I died? That really isn't funny."
"Chandler";"Well, how you died was funny."
"Ross";"Oh please, hit by a blimp?"
"Chandler";"It kills over one americans every year."
"Ross";"Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here."
"Chandler";"You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!"
"Ross";"You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic."
"Phoebe";"God, I wish Mike were here."
"Monica";"Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?"
"Monica";"What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!"
"Phoebe";"I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that."
"Monica";"Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone."
"Phoebe";"Here."
"Monica";"And now your cell."
"Phoebe";"Okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)"
"Monica";"This is your cellphone?"
"Phoebe";"Yes."
"Monica";"This is your current cellphone?"
"Phoebe";"Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time."
"Monica";"Phoebe, where's your purse?"
"Monica";"No, no! Give it to me!"
"Phoebe";"You can't have it."
"Monica";"Give it to me!"
"Phoebe";"No (tucks it in her pants)"
"Monica";"I'll go in there."
"Phoebe";"(disbelievingly) Oh yeah."
"Monica";"Phoebe come here"
"Monica";"Haha!"
"Phoebe";"Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!"
"Joey";"Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend."
"Rachel";"Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore."
"Joey";"No, no, it's not a girl, it's...  a brand new Hugsy!"
"Rachel";"Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's."
"Joey";"No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back."
"Rachel";"Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail..."
"Joey";"Make the transfer! (She does so)"
"Rachel";"Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?"
"Joey";"Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago."
"Rachel";"Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy."
"Joey";"But he's the same."
"Rachel";"Yeah, I think she wants the old one back."
"Joey";"But he's the same."
"Rachel";"Joey, come on!"
"Joey";"He's the same!"
"Joey";"(to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!"
"Monica";"Haha!"
"Phoebe";"You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building."
"Monica";"So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door."
"Phoebe";"Those are my shoes."
"Monica";"Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping."
"Phoebe";"Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now."
"Monica";"Who's that? (goes to open door)"
"Phoebe";"I ordered Chinese food."
"Phoebe";"What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?"
"Monica";"(To Mike) What are you doing here?"
"Mike";"Phoebe called me."
"Monica";"Phoebe!"
"Phoebe";"I'm sorry, I broke down...  I wanted to see him."
"Monica";"Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?"
"Phoebe";"There is a speakerphone on the base unit..."
"Monica";"Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!"
"Mike";"Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see..."
"Monica";"(to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!"
"Mike";"Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!"
"Monica";"Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder."
"Phoebe";"Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?"
"Monica";"Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical)."
"Phoebe";"Sit down."
"Monica";"Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)"
"Mike";"(to Phoebe) So how've you been?"
"Monica";"I've been pretty good!"
"Mike";"(to Phoebe) You look really beautiful."
"Phoebe";"Thanks, you look good too."
"Monica";"Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!"
"Phoebe";"So how's the piano playing going?"
"Mike";"Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you."
"Phoebe";"I've missed you too."
"Monica";"You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!"
"Chandler";"Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?"
"Ross";"uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)"
"Chandler";"Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?"
"Ross";"Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?"
"Chandler";"No, come on, you know that's not true."
"Ross";"What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!"
"Chandler";"Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community."
"Ross";"I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)"
"Chandler";"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief."
"Ross";"You're right. There isn't a decent outlet."
"Chandler";"Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come."
"Ross";"Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)"
"Chandler";"Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?"
"Ross";"No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!"
"Chandler";"Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"
"Ross";"oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man..."
"Rachel";"I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?"
"Joey";"Original or crappy?"
"Rachel";"Original."
"Joey";"No, sorry haven't seen him."
"Rachel";"Then what's that big lump under your covers?"
"Joey";"It's Monica, ok?"
"Rachel";"That's not Monica!"
"Joey";"Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him.."
"Rachel";"(to herself) Oh God."
"Joey";"... she's being unreasonable!"
"Rachel";"(yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!"
"Joey";"It does?"
"Rachel";"Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much."
"Joey";"Really? She... she loves me?"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room)."
"Joey";"Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then...  well she can have him."
"Rachel";"Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!"
"Joey";"Look forget it forget it...  I can't do it."
"Rachel";"Are you gonna...  you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?"
"Joey";"How do you think I got him in the first place?"
"Monica";"Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it."
"Mike";"I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night."
"Phoebe";"I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?"
"Mike";"It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time...  I never would have stopped."
"Monica";"(running back into the room) Kiss him, you fool!!"
"Phoebe";"What?"
"Monica";"Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I missed you so much! (she kisses Mike)"
"Strange man";"(he bounds into the house) I knew you'd be here!"
"Mike";"Oh, crap!"
"Phoebe";"Who is this?"
"Mike";"My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you."
"Monica";"Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!"
"Manny";"Well, you are not doing a very good job!"
"Monica";"Excuse me?"
"Manny";"What's with the kissing?"
"Monica";"Hey, at least I knew where my guy was."
"Manny";"Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!"
"Monica";"You didn't hear the speech!"
"Manny";"I've heard the speech: (in a mocking voice) "if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... ""
"Monica";"Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!"
"Manny";"You're weak!"
"Monica";"You're... weird!"
"Manny";"Your pants are undone!"
"Monica";"Oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!"
"Manny";"(looking at the sofa) Where did they go?"
"Monica";"Damn it!"
"Manny";"Oh we blew it. I blame myself."
"Monica";"And I blame you too."
"Ross";"It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!"
"Chandler";"There you go! Someone came!"
"Ross";"Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)"
"Monica";"Hi, glad you could come."
"Chandler";"(in a mournful voice) Please, come in."
"Tom";"Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class."
"Chandler";"Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat."
"Tom";"Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's..."
"Chandler";"At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)"
"Ross";"Who is he?"
"Chandler";"Some guy, Tom Gordon."
"Ross";"I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)"
"Monica";"So, did you know Ross well?"
"Tom";"Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?"
"Monica";"(a bit surprised) Yes, he is. Me."
"Tom";"What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?"
"Chandler";"(entering, very upset) Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)"
"Tom";"(before leaving) Hey, listen. Call me."
"Chandler";"Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)"
"Ross";"(coming in) I'm dead and no one cares?"
"Monica";"I look like a man??"
"Chandler";"Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!"
"Ross";"It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!"
"Chandler";"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!"
"Ross";"Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?"
"Chandler";"Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?"
"Ross";"(sceptical) Yeah..."
"Chandler";"I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)"
"Kori";"Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service."
"Chandler";"Kori? Kori Weston?"
"Kori";"Yeah..."
"Chandler";"Wow! You look amazing!"
"Kori";"And you are..."
"Chandler";"Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all."
"Monica";"You are married though."
"Chandler";"Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)"
"Kori";"I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad."
"Chandler";"I didn't know Ross and you were so close."
"Kori";"We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him."
"Chandler";"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
"Kori";"I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance."
"Ross";"(he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!"
"Kori";"You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you! (she leaves and slams the door behind her)"
"Ross";"Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!"
"Ross";"(on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?"
"Joey";"Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?"
"Monica";"Ok."
"Joey";"Alright!"
"Monica";"But ehm...what is it not?"
"Joey";"(abashed) A place to entertain my lady friends."
"Monica";"And what else is it not?"
"Joey";"(even more abashed) A place to eat spaghetti."
"Monica";"Very good! (Gives him the keys) What do you need itfor anyway?"
"Joey";"Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million andthey don't sell tickets here in New York, so..."
"Rachel";"Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?"
"Joey";"(hesitates for a moment)Yeah Connecticut...Not WestVirginia."
"Monica";"Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buysome tickets myself!"
"Joey";"Uh!"
"Monica";"Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could reallyuse 300 million dollars."
"Chandler";"Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300million? No thank you!"
"Phoebe";"Hey will you get me tickets too?"
"Rachel";"Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we allpitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win,we'll split it!"
"Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross";"yeah thats a greatidea!"
"Ross";"No thanks!"
"Phoebe";"You don't wanna win the lottery?"
"Ross";"(in a  mocking voice)Uh...sure I do, and I also wannabe King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart."
"Chandler";"Still on Amelia Earhart?"
"Ross";"The woman just vanished!"
"Joey";"Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?"
"Ross";"No! Do you know what your odds are of winning thelottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck bylightning 42 times."
"Chandler";"Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to getstruck by lightning 7 times."
"Joey";"I like those odds!"
"Ross";"Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going tospend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki."
"Chandler";"(looking around at the others)I'll ask. (To Ross)Boohaki?"
"Ross";"Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we'retrying to be careful about what words we use in front of her."
"Rachel";"Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki,goshdarnit and brotherpucker."
"Monica";"How do you know she's gonna start talking?"
"Rachel";"Well when I talk to her I almost feel like sheunderstands what I'm saying."
"Chandler";"Kinda like Joey."
"Joey";"(who wasn't paying attention)What's that now?"
"Monica";"God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! Youknow I haven't won anything since the sixth grade."
"Chandler";"Pie eating contest?"
"Monica";"Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only wayI could win something?"
"Chandler";"No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries."
"Monica";"(smiling)That was a good day!"
"Ross";"(yelling to Monica)They're towing your car, they'retowing your car!!"
"Monica";"I'm parked in a garage on Morton!"
"Ross";"(panting)They're towing"
"Joey";"(sounding panicky)Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma!And Rachel you don't have Emma! (Starts yelling) Where's Emma? Who hasEmma!?"
"Rachel";"Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. Youwere there!"
"Joey";"(not yelling anymore)I was?"
"Racel";"Yes and you talked to her..."
"Joey";"I did?"
"Rachel";"She dropped off a casserole?"
"Joey";"Oh yeah! The casserole lady."
"Monica";"(to Ross)So, did you come by to watch us win the bigbucks?"
"Ross";"Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we couldall go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancingon top of it!"
"Chandler";"(hysterical)Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'llget it, I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)"
"Ross";"(to Monica)Think he washed his hands?"
"Chandler";"(into receiver)Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?"
"Rachel";"(to Monica)What's going on?"
"Monica";"Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting anassistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they areonly hiring three."
"Joey";"Ooh! Tough odds!"
"Ross";"(mockingly)Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your24 state lottery!"
"Joey";"(smiling)Look who's coming around!"
"Chandler";"(still on the phone)Damnit. Alright call me whenyou know more."
"Joey";"(excited)Did you get it?"
"Chandler";"One of the slots got filled."
"Joey";"(Still excited)By you!?"
"Chandler";"Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it."
"Monica";"Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up yourpants!"
"Chandler";"Yeah I know."
"Rachel";"Well, there's two spots left right?"
"Chandler";"Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wannaget one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't careabout Charlie."
"Phoebe";"(excited)Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going tobelieve this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonnawin the lottery tonight!"
"Monica";"Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extraluck so I brought a wishbone home from work."
"Ross";"(mockingly)A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someoneelse a chance!"
"Monica";"Alright, who wants to do it?"
"Phoebe";"Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat themeat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!"
"Monica";"Ok, hey Rach?"
"Rachel";"Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smellall over my hands."
"Joey";"I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine."
"Phoebe";"I hope I win!"
"Monica";"Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishingfor the same thing, right?"
"Joey";"I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...youknow...won't come true!"
"Monica";"Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!"
"Joey";"Can't really say!"
"Monica";"I understand, but you're wishing for what we thinkyou're wishing for, aren't you?"
"Joey";"(slightly irritated)I'm not really comfortable withthese questions!"
"Rachel, Chandler and Monica";"Please, just do it!"
"Phoebe";"One, two, three!"
"Joey";"I won, hey!"
"Ross";"You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true,but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rubthis lamp! (rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot) Ah!! That thinggets hot!!"
"Rachel";"You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How areyou gonna feel if we actually do win?"
"Ross";"Uh, you're not gonna win."
"Rachel";"Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, butsomebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel?You know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take ourhelicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, I can'tguys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai""
"Ross";"Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing likethat."
"Chandler";"I can see the headline now: "Lottery winners' friendfilled with regret eats own arm"."
"Ross";"Why would I eat my own arm?"
"Chandler";"Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we canprint whatever we want."
"Monica";"You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks foryou."
"Ross";"Why?"
"Monica";"Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki"but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you'remy brother, and I want you to be a part of this."
"Ross";"You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But justthe fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet!Come here (they kiss and hug)"
"Phoebe";"Get a room!"
"Chandler";"Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do ifwe win?"
"Ross";"I don't know, probably just invest it."
"Chandler";"Ooh! Calm down ..."
"Joey";"Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?"
"Ross";"Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cooland piss it all away" (Joey and Chandler pleased)"
"Joey";"Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buythe Knicks!"
"Rachel";"I don't really care about the Knicks."
"Joey";"Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward."
"Rachel";"(touched) You would do that? I never get picked!"
"Chandler";"You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way togo."
"Joey";"You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believeyou're taking this away from me!"
"Chandler";"You're right, it has been you dream for over 15seconds."
"Ross";"(to Rachel) Uh, how long until they announce thenumbers, Mommy?"
"Chandler";"(looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh... Mommy?"
"Ross";"Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy"when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ..."
"Rachel";"I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be herfirst word."
"Ross";"Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably callme "Daddy" too."
"Phoebe";"Oooh, I like that, "daddy" (in a sexy tone)"
"Ross";"I ... I was just talking about Rachel."
"Phoebe";"(still in sexy tone) Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Isdaddy gonna spank me?"
"Ross";"(tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have youbeen a baaad gi .. (stops) no I can't."
"Chandler";"Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody elsehear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept withhim!! .. Alright, bye. (hangs up)"
"Joey";"Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?"
"Chandler";"Well no, Charlie's gonna get that."
"Monica";"Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance asanybody else of getting that job!"
"Chandler";"He's the boss's son."
"Monica";"Come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)"
"Rachel";"Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes."
"Monica";"Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets asquickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideashow to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) Ok, how about this: wedivide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read bywhoever finishes their pile first."
"Rachel";"Ooh, I have another idea!"
"Monica";"I'm sorry, idea time is over."
"Phoebe";"Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Chandler";"What about the ones you have on the nightstand?"
"Monica";"There are no tickets on the nightstand!"
"Chandler";"Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago."
"Monica";"Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!"
"Chandler";"Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!"
"Monica";"Chandler, sense the tone!!"
"Rachel";"Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!"
"Monica";"Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me andChandler."
"Phoebe";"Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed."
"Ross";"I can't believe this, I thought we were all in thistogether!"
"Monica";"Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!"
"Ross";"3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ..."
"Joey";"I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut,when did you even get those?"
"Monica";"When you were reading the dirty magazines withouttaking off the plastic!"
"Joey";"(to Ross) I'll show you how."
"Rachel";"Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" ticketswin? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose allyour friends?"
"Monica";"Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are notgonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week andI couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!"
"Rachel";"Chandler, would you just tell her what she did waswrong?"
"Chandler";"(to Mon) She's right, you shouldn't have boughttickets just for us ..."
"Monica";"Ahhh!  (shocked)"
"Chandler";"Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, itdoesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to haveprinciples, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets fromRachel)"
"Monica";"There's the man I married!!"
"Rachel";"All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it'sthe last you're gonna hear from us!"
"Monica";"Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends!Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look justlike you!"
"Rachel";"(surprised) OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! Iwant my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!"
"Joey";"Yeah, I want my tickets too (takes the bowl fromRachel)! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!"
"Ross";"Than I want mine, too (takes the bowl from Joey)! Andif I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond."
"Phoebe";"Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the ticketstogether (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)"
"Monica";"No, no! We should divide them up (picks up the bowl)and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!"
"Joey";"Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me!This all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)"
"Chandler";"Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!"
"Rachel";"Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split themup! (she tries to snatch the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, soshe pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)"
"Joey";"(in pain) Oh!"
"Phoebe";"(she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and shestarts running around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!"
"Ross";"(trying to stop her) Hey, hey!!"
"Phoebe";"(keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (shestops) Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! (shegoes out to the balcony)"
"Rachel";"Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets."
"Joey";"No, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they getjammed in the window)"
"Phoebe";"If we are not doing it together, we're not doing itat all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl, andmakes as to drop the tickets on the street)."
"Everyone";"NO!!"
"Phoebe";"Don't come any closer!"
"Chandler";"Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things aregetting squished..."
"Phoebe";"No, what's more important, your friends or money?"
"Everyone but Monica";"Friends!"
"Monica";"Money! (they all look at her) Friends..."
"Phoebe";"Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?"
"Monica";"They're all in there! Even these five that I hid inmy bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to Phoebe)..."
"Ross";"Monica!"
"Phoebe";"Ok, good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There wasno way I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring Phoebewho drops the bowl on the street) Oh God, no! (pause) I think I brokeyour bowl."
"Ross";"Go, go, go!!"
"Phoebe";"What a beautiful night to be running around thestreet, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun."
"Monica";"Phoebe, we lost half of them."
"Phoebe";"So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! Mypsychic said I  was gonna win, remember?"
"Ross";"Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about thescary pigeon..."
"Phoebe";"As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going todie. (pause ) So, excuse me for being a little skittish."
"Chandler";"(looking at the answering machine) Hey, there's twomessages. These could be from work!"
"Monica";"Oh, play them!"
"Chandler";"Ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)"
"Message";"(Phoebe's voice) "Hello. Th-this is the pigeon fromthe balcony calling to apologise" (they all turns to look at Phoebe) "Ish.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady'shand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo.""
"Phoebe";"Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do."
"Second message";""Hey Chandler, it's Charlie""
"Chandler";"This is..shhh!"
"Second Message";""Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot.I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me acall if you want.""
"Monica";"Oh God, I am so sorry honey..."

"Rachel";"Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time theypromoted Sandra over me at work."
"Chandler";"Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?"
"Rachel";"No, she was just much better at job than me!"
"Phoebe";"Guys, the drawing is about to start!"
"Rachel";"(To Ross) You know what? We should call my mum'shouse and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down."
"Ross";"Oh yeah, it's a good idea!"
"Monica";"(she hugs Chandler) Honey, you've been really strongabout this, I know how badly you wanted that job."
"Chandler";"Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.(pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130chances to win, right?"

"Ross";"(calling Rachel) Come on!!"
"Rachel";"(on the phone) Mum, please!I know you love your newlips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let mesay goodnight to my daughter?"
"TV";""And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7""
"Monica";"Check your numbers! Make me rich!"
"Rachel";"(she goes towards the others and she's very excited)Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight toEmma and she said her first words!!"
"All";"Wow!"
"Joey";"And what did she say?"
"Rachel";"She said "gleba"!! (she celebrates)"
"Monica";"Make me rich!!"
"Rachel";"(to Ross) Isn't that amazing?"
"Ross";"Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!"
"Rachel";"Why-why aren't you more excited?"
"Ross";"Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word."
"Rachel";"Oh, but of course it is!"
"Ross";"Okay, what does it mean?"
"Rachel";"I don't know all the words."
"Ross";"I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter'sfirst words (goes back to checking the tickets)."
"Ross";"Yes you did, gleba is a word!"
"Ross";"Ok, use it in a sentence."
"Rachel";"Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!"
"Ross";"It's not a word!"
"Rachel";"Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up (she goesand picks up the dictionary)."
"Ross";"Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it shesaid another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up:pbbqqt...."
"Rachel";"(searching the dictionary) Alright, okay, okay, gleba,gleba... (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearinginner mass of a certain fungi."
"Ross";"She's gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head,very moved)"
"Joey";"(checking the last ticket) Damnit! anybody got anything?"
"Chandler";"No."
"Phoebe";"I'm still looking through mine..."
"Monica";"Just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) No!"
"Monica";"(answering phone) Hello? Hold on. It's your boss."
"Chandler";"Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'mnot used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from thesofa) Hey, Steve."
"Steve";"Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the threepositions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, youwouldn't be happy being someone's assistant."
"Chandler";"Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant!Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm nottoo mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!"
"Steve";"Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program.We're offering you the position of junior copywriter."
"Chandler";"Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?"
"Steve";"Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level ofsophistication you'll be bringing to the job."
"Chandler";"Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see youtomorrow (hangs up)."
"Chandler";"What? (pause) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a juniorcopywriter."
"Everybody";"(excited) Oh my God, congratulations!"
"Monica";"Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!"
"Chandler";"Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?"
"Monica";"You bet! No TV or anything! (she gets up from the sofaand goes to the kitchen area)"
"Joey";"(to Chandler) Hey, that is so great about the job."
"Chandler";"Thanks, man."
"Joey";"And I like to think I had a little something to do withit."
"Chandler";"Really? What?"
"Joey";"Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish wewould win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job."
"Chandler";"(smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards thekitchen, worried) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heartright out."
"Joey";"Oh yeah."
"Rachel";"You know what? There is a little part of me thatreally thought we were gonna win."
"Ross";"Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart themepark."
"Phoebe";"You guys, what was the Powerball number again?"
"Monica and Ross";"Seven."
"Phoebe";"We won."
"Rachel";"What?"
"Phoebe";"We won!"
"Monica";"Let me see!"
"Phoebe";"Don't tear it."
"Ross";"Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers."
"Phoebe";"I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number,we've won 3 dollars!"
"Chandler";"Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years orgo for the big payout."
"Phoebe";"(still very excited) I don't care, I've never wonanything before, I can't believe this!"
"Rachel";"So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?"
"Phoebe";"It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents."
"Monica";"You know what? You can have mine."
"Chandler";"Me too."
"Joey";"Me too."
"Rachel";"Me too."
"Ross";"I guess if everybody else is..."
"Joey";"(sitting in a chair) Hey guys, so I just called thePowerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won."
"Phoebe";"I beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and herplate of cookies)."
"Gunther";"Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guyin here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside,and won $10,000 (goes to the counter)."
"Phoebe";"(hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the"pigeon voice" from before) Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. Itwas not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) Seriously, stopstaring at her."
"Joey";"(talking to a pineapple in his hand) God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do."
"Joey";"I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you."
"Rachel";"I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less."
"Joey";"Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!"
"Rachel";"Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!"
"Joey";"Yeah, that was a disappointment...(pause) Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?"
"Rachel";"(excited) Are you serious?"
"Joey";"Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again."
"Rachel";"Hey, that was an honest mistake!"
"Joey";"Right!(he starts to ape her)"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?" (he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts)"
"Rachel";"Yeah, that was an awesome day!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hi!"
"Monica";"So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?"
"Phoebe";"Sure!"
"Ross";"I'd love to!"
"Monica";"Well you"
"Phoebe";"Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!"
"Ross";"Phoebe, what happened?"
"Phoebe";"Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!"
"Chandler";"(To Monica) Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!"
"Phoebe";"Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!"
"Chandler";"What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont (shows them a brochure)!"
"Phoebe";"Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!"
"Chandler";"So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?"
"Monica";"Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!"
"Chandler";"Are you really that busy?"
"Monica";"Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am."
"Chandler";"Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it (pause) Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? (pause) Oh, can't you make an exception?""
"Monica";"Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!"
"Phoebe";"And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!"
"Chandler";"(on the phone) "Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" (pause) "Oh, thank you very much!" (hangs up) Yeah, I'm going to Vermont..."
"Ross";"Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance."
"Chandler";"I don't have travel insurance."
"Ross";"Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!"
"Monica";"Why don't you take Ross?"
"Ross";"Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn..."
"Monica";"No, not if their room has two beds!"
"Ross";"(browsing the brochure) I guess...It still seems a little...(enthusiastically)"
"Rachel";"Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?"
"Joey";"I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!"
"Rachel";"Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so"
"Joey";"Also so"
"Rachel";"Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!"
"Joey";"Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!"
"Director";"Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!"
"Joey";"Oh, wish me luck!"
"Rachel";"Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?"
"Joey";"Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!"
"Rachel";"Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck! (they hug)"
"Director";"On a bell please! Quietly.. and ACTION!"
"Actress/Olivia";"Drake! What are you doing in here?"
"Joey/Drake";"Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life."
"Actress/Olivia";"Get out!"
"Joey/Drake";"You don't love him!"
"Actress/Olivia";"What do you know about love?"
"Joey/Drake";"I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge."
"Actress/Olivia";"That kiss never happened."
"Joey/Drake";"Oh, what about this one."
"Rachel";"(watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) OH!"
"Actress/Olivia";"No, I told you...get out!"
"Joey/Drake";"Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question..."
"Chase Lassiter";"(talking to Rachel) You look familiar, have we..."
"Rachel";"SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!"
"Joey/Drake";"Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?"
"Actress/Olivia";"I don't have a choice..."
"Joey/Drake";"Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you."
"Actress/Olivia";"Don't say that..."
"Joey/Drake";"Tell me to stop, just...tell me to stop. (he's about to kiss her)"
"Director";"CUT!"
"Rachel";"NO! (pause) Or, cut!You know, that's your call!"
"1st Customer";"Everything was delicious!"
"Monica";"Thank you!"
"2nd Customer";"It was. The duck in particular was superb."
"Monica";"Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything..."
"3rd Customer";"Actually I do have one small complaint."
"Monica";"Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism."
"3rd Customer";"The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!"
"Monica";"What musician?"
"Phoebe";"(playing guitar and singing) And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè!"
"Monica";"What are you doing here!"
"Phoebe";"Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!"
"Monica";"Great!"
"Phoebe";"Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home"."
"Monica";"Listen Phoebe..."
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Monica";"You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but..."
"Phoebe";"But what?"
"Monica";"This is kind of a classy place."
"Phoebe";"(pause) Ok, say no more."
"Phoebe";"(with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to Monica, showing her dress) Classy, uh?"
"Chandler";"Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation."
"Receptionist";"Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?"
"Chandler";"New York."
"Ross";"(in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple!"
"Chandler";"I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here."
"Ross";"Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody."
"Receptionist";"I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer."
"Chandler";"Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?"
"Ross";"(high pitched voice) Check again please!"
"Receptionist";"I'm sorry, it's not here."
"Ross";"Not there."
"Chandler";"Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?"
"Receptionist";"I don't know what to say."
"Ross";"(mumbling) She doesn't know what to say!"
"Chandler";"Just give us the cheapest room you have."
"Receptionist";"Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars."
"Chandler";"That's insane!"
"Ross";"Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves."
"Chandler";"Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it."
"Receptionist";"Great."
"Chandler";"(aside, to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off!"
"Ross";"Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!"
"Chandler";"Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!"
"Ross";"C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!"
"Chandler";"Dude, you're shaking!"
"Ross";"I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?"
"Rachel";"Hi!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking"
"Joey";"Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good"
"Rachel";"God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!"
"Joey";"Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?"
"Rachel";"Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress."
"Joey";"Oh, all right, I can ask Monica."
"Rachel";"Oh screw her, that part is mine!"
"Joey";"Right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here."
"Rachel";"Okay. (pause).(acting) Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here."
"Joey/Drake";"I can't believe you married him."
"Rachel/actress";"But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a"
"Joey/Drake";"So what about us? Everything we feel for each other."
"Rachel/actress";"It's over! You"
"Joey/Drake";"How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now."
"Rachel";"(pause) Kiss me."
"Joey";"What?"
"Rachel";"Kiss me."
"Joey";"Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!"
"Rachel";"No, I'm saying..."
"Joey";"but, but.."
"Rachel";"just... don't talk... (she kisses him)"
"Rachel";"(waking up) Ehhh, aw! (pause). Well, that's new!"
"Ross";"(on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? (pause) Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons."
"Ross";"What did you get?"
"Chandler";"USA Today"
"Ross";"Nice, put it with the others."
"Chandler";"And I also got... two more apples."
"Ross";"We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!"
"Chandler";"I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant."
"Ross";"Oh, that's not cool."
"Chandlers";"Dude, none of this is"
"Ross";"No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the"
"Chandler";"I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that."
"Ross";"Not my first time in a hotel, my friend."
"Chandler";"Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?"
"Ross";"No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!"
"Chandler";"Yes, but the batteries..."
"Chandler";"Thank you, thank you very much!"
"Ross";"Let's celebrate with some maple candy!"
"Chandler";"No!"
"Ross";"At least tell me where you hid it."
"Rachel";"Can I ask you a question?"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?"
"Monica";"Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head."
"Rachel";"Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey."
"Monica";"Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?"
"Rachel";"Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense."
"Monica";"What do you think brought than on?"
"Rachel";"I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday."
"Monica";"A love scene? With who?"
"Rachel";"Olivia."
"Monica";"Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important."
"Rachel";"So do you think that my dream means anything?"
"Monica";"I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake."
"Rachel";"Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream..."
"Monica";"Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college."
"Rachel";"You took the same class twice."
"Monica";"It was hard!"
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Rachel and Monica";"Hi."
"Phoebe";"Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man."
"Monica";"Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place."
"Phoebe";"Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault."
"Monica";"Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore."
"Phoebe";"Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot)."
"Rachel";"Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work..."
"Phoebe";"My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?"
"Rachel";"Ok, we're still on that."
"Monica";"I didn't say your songs were not good enough."
"Phoebe";"Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?"
"Monica";"Tiny portions?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it"!"
"Monica";"Phoebe, it's not about quantity."
"Phoebe";"Well...it's not about quality."
"Monica";"Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in."
"Phoebe";"Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica."
"Monica";"Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs."
"Phoebe";"Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?"
"Monica";"You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy."
"Phoebe";"What are people having, the garlic Martini?"
"Receptionist";"Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay."
"Chandler";"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps."
"Chandler";"Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax."
"Ross";"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game."
"Ross";"Oh my god."
"Chandler";"What?"
"Ross";"There's something new in the bowl."
"Chandler";"Look, we have enough, just walk away."
"Ross";"No, but I want...I want the pinecones!"
"Chandler";"There's a forest right outside."
"Ross";"It's not the same."
"Chandler";"Ok, go quick!"
"Ross";"(to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay."
"Ross";"Oh, my maple candy!"
"Phoebe";"(singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.."
"Monica";"Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall."
"Phoebe";"You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself."
"Monica";"Ok, you have to stop playing now."
"Phoebe";"Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!"
"Monica";"Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!"
"Phoebe";"(while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!"
"Monica";"(to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)"
"Phoebe";"Ok, ok, how many of you"
"Monica";"Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again)."
"Phoebe";"Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?"
"Monica";"Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)"
"Phoebe";"Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands)."
"Monica";"Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand)"
"Phoebe";"Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)"
"Monica";"I'm sorry..."
"Phoebe";"I'm sorry too... (they hug)"
"Monica";"ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p..."
"Phoebe";"(smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?"
"Joey";"(Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all!"
"Rachel";"(looks puzzled) How...how...?"
"Joey";"I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?"
"Rachel";"uh-huh"
"Joey";"And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!"
"Rachel";"(to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake..."
"Joey";"What?"
"Rachel";"What...how is it going with Drake?"
"Joey";"Oh...I don't think it's going very well..."
"Rachel";"What...that scene I saw was so good!"
"Joey";"Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow..."
"Rachel";"Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?"
"Joey";"A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia."
"Rachel";"So?"
"Joey";"So...I've never played that!"
"Rachel";"Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?"
"Joey";"Uh...well...just once...with you..."
"Rachel";"Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?"
"Joey";"(looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about??"
"Rachel";"(shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene."
"Joey";"(approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me."
"Rachel";"(looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before..."
"Joey";"Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you."
"Joey";"(excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)"
"Chandler";"I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table)"
"Monica";"(without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty!"
"Ross";"(sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?"
"Joey";"(enters the room) Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?"
"Chandler";"(browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV."
"Joey";"Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play."
"Chandler";"I could fall asleep at a play."
"Phoebe";"What is it?"
"Joey";"It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life"."
"Monica";"It sounds interesting!"
"Ross";"Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett... (Ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep)"
"Phoebe";"I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?"
"Joey";"You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!"
"Ross";"What? How come that you don't have to go!"
"Joey";"I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work"
"Chandler";"(browsing through a diary) Uh, let's see, who do I hate?"
"Rachel";"(gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but Joey blocks her way) Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry."
"Joey";"(lifts Rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) Hey, here you go."
"Rachel";"Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?"
"Monica";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?"
"Monica";"No, I don't think it ever works. Why?"
"Rachel";"No reason."
"Monica";"No, no, Rachel?"
"Rachel";"Yeah"
"Monica";"Who do you wanna fool around with?"
"Rachel";"(with high pitched voice) Nobody, forget it!"
"Rachel";"(giggling and whispering) Maybe."
"Monica";"(whispering) You can't!"
"Rachel";"(whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with "because") Seriously I did not understand a word that you said."
"Monica";"In the hall."
"Monica";"You wanna fool around with Joey?"
"Rachel";"Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!"
"Monica";"Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?"
"Rachel";"Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet."
"Monica";"Who, who are they?"
"Rachel";"I know them from work."
"Monica";"Both of them?"
"Rachel";"No, one of them..."
"Monica";"Which one?"
"Rachel";"I don't know, what were the names I just said?"
"Monica";"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated."
"Monica";"What the hell are you cooking!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Chandler";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today."
"Chandler";"Yes, but, Ross you"
"Ross";"(covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus."
"Monica";"What's so bad about that?"
"Ross";"It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches."
"Monica";"(fingering her elbow): Ross?"
"Ross";"(looking his elbow, where there's a patch) These aren't suede."
"Charlie";"(to Gunther) Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?"
"Gunther";"No."
"Ross";"Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller."
"Charlie";"Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer."
"Ross";"Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice."
"Charlie";"It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around."
"Ross";"Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out."
"Monica";"(to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us?"
"Chandler";"(to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now."
"Charlie";"And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis."
"Ross";"Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute."
"Monica";"(to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month."
"Ross";"(hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover."
"Charlie";"Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?"
"Ross";"I don't think so."
"Charlie";"I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?"
"Ross";"Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all". (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?"
"Charlie";"You don't think we should wait for him?"
"Ross";"You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?"
"Professor Spafford";"Professor Geller?"
"Ross";"Oh, damn it!"
"Jane";"(from the answering machine) Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye."
"Joey";"(entering the room) Hey!"
"Rachel";"Hey!"
"Joey";"What's happenin'?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight."
"Joey";"Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first"
"Rachel";"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)"
"Message";""Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight" (Joey's upset and stops it)"
"Joey";"(yelling) Stupid Jane Rogers!!"
"Rachel";"(angry) You are having a party tonight??"
"Joey";"Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people."
"Rachel";"And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?"
"Joey";"I do it every year."
"Rachel";"You do that every year??"
"Joey";"I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!"
"Rachel";"Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??"
"Joey";"Yeah..."
"Rachel";"And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?"
"Joey";"Yeah..."
"Rachel";"OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?"
"Joey";"(Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one!"
"Rachel";"Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?"
"Joey";"You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!"
"Rachel";"Well, then so you just invite me...!"
"Joey";"(speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!"
"Rachel";"Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please..."
"Joey";"Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8."
"Rachel";"(yelling and jumping like a child) OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! (realizing how she's behaving) And it's out of my system!"
"Professor Spafford";"(speaking very slowly) And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish."
"Ross";"(very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?"
"Professor Spafford";"And that's not all I'm allergic to."
"Ross";"(to Charlie) Oh, it's not over!"
"Professor Spafford";"I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts..."
"Ross";"So basically all nuts?"
"Professor Spafford";"Interestingly... no."
"Charlie";"Kinda playing fast and loose with the word "interesting"."
"Professor Spafford";"If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom. (he goes away)"
"Charlie";"Oh my God!!"
"Ross";"I've lost the will to live."
"Charlie";"Let's ditch him!"
"Ross";"What?"
"Charlie";"Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!"
"Ross";"Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll..."
"Charlie";"Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!! (they run outside)"
"Ross";"(entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica."
"Phoebe";"Hi!"
"Ross";"Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department."
"Phoebe";"Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?"
"Charlie";"Well, I think he's a little out there, but he"
"Phoebe";"Ah, ah."
"Charlie";"(her mobile phone rings) Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. (she cuts herself off for a moment)"
"Ross";"(to Phoebe) Ranion's theory of species variegation?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!"
"Monica";"(to Ross) So, did you two have fun?"
"Ross";"Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny..."
"Monica";"And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud)"
"Rachel";"(she enters wearing a bath-robe) Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play."
"Ross";"Really? Wh-what's wrong?"
"Rachel";"I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!"
"Charlie";"Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry."
"Rachel";"... Ok, who is this?"
"Ross";"I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue."
"Rachel";"Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!"
"Monica";"Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?"
"Rachel";"Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh..."
"Monica";"You're not sick!"
"Rachel";"What? Yes, I am!"
"Monica";"Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??"
"Rachel";"When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)"
"Monica";"You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!"
"Rachel";"Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!"
"Monica";"Ok, what is this?"
"Rachel";"Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!"
"Monica";"(aloud) WHAT?"
"Ross";"(looking at them) Wh-what's going on?"
"Monica";"Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!"
"Rachel";"And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!"
"Charlie";"I thought you came to say you were sick."
"Rachel";"Ok professor or detective?"
"Phoebe";"Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that"
"Phoebe";"And that horrible museum tour!"
"Ross";"No, I arranged that..."
"Joey";"(sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun."
"Phoebe";"We know about your party Joey."
"Joey";"What party?"
"Monica";"The game's over! Take off your robe!"
"Joey";"(looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean..."
"Everyone";"No!! Cover it up!!"
"Joey";"(to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves)"
"Joey";"(To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming."
"Monica";"Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!"
"Kyle Lowder";"(to Monica) Hi. (walks on)"
"Monica";"(Yells after him) I love you!"
"Joey";"Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something..."
"Monica";"Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered."
"Phoebe";"Hey!"
"Monica";"(Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself."
"Phoebe";"Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where"
"Monica";"(Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler!"
"Chandler";"Where the hell"
"Bitter lady";"(yelling) Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period."
"Monica";"(to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love"."
"Rachel";"Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number."
"Monica";"Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!"
"Matthew Ashford";"It was nice to meet you Rachel."
"Rachel";"Nice to meet you."
"Matthew Ashford";"Call me."
"Rachel";"Ok"
"Monica";"(yelling after him) We will!!"
"Monica";"(to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys!"
"Rachel";"Yeah!"
"Monica";"I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?"
"Rachel";"Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!"
"Monica";"Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather)"
"Ross";"(to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?"
"Charlie";"Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone."
"Ross";"Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?"
"Charlie";"Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with."
"Ross";"You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?"
"Charlie";"Yeah..."
"Ross";"... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby..."
"Charlie";"Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man."
"Ross";"Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!"
"Charlie";"Yes! And while that"
"Ross";"(very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood"."
"Charlie";"Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was"
"Ross";"Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?"
"Charlie";"A guy who won two."
"Ross";"(a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart"
"Charlie";"Yeah... for three years."
"Ross";"Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who"
"Charlie";"(smiling and thinks for a moment)... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy."
"Ross";"Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?"
"Charlie";"No, but he"
"Ross";"Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)"
"Phoebe";"Hey Ross!"
"Rache";"How is it going with Charlie?"
"Ross";"(sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out."
"Phoebe";"Oh, What's the matter?"
"Ross";"She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth."
"Rachel";"I always loved that!!"
"Ross";"Of course"
"Phoebe";"Worse?"
"Ross";"Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) "Can we walk"? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that?"
"Phoebe";"(still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)"
"Ross";"What? (turns around to look at Rachel)"
"Rachel";"Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves)"
"Bitter lady";"Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?"
"Chandler";"(To himself) oh yes, God yes!!"
"Bitter lady";"(now yelling) Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. (Now standing right in front of Chandler and bending down almost to his level as if speaking to him, yelling even louder)"
"Chandler";"I... I don't know... you seem lovely."
"Joey";"Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)"
"Ross";"Nice to meet you."
"Dirk";"Hey! So what show are you on?"
"Ross";"Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology."
"Joey";"It's a science."
"Dirk";"Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize."
"Joey";"Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or..."
"Ross";"Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys."
"Dirk";"Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs."
"Ross";"I'd lead with that."
"Monica";"That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so)."
"Joey";"Monica!"
"Monica";"Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!"
"Joey";"(To Rachel) What have you got there?"
"Ross";"Just some boys gave me their phone numbers."
"Joey";"Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?"
"Rachel";"(drunken voice) I think I am."
"Joey";"(browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different."
"Joey";"(discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass..."
"Rachel";"(picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with"
"Joey";"Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best."
"Rachel";"Joey, you're so sweet."
"Joey";"That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight."
"Rachel";"Who (looks around)?"
"Joey";"Me."
"Rachel";"(surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really?"
"Joey";"Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!"
"Rachel";"Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five)"
"Joey";"Gotcha."
"Rachel";"Oh, Very funny... Joey."
"Chandler";"(to Monica) So, how did"
"Monica";"Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry."
"Chandler";"Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater."
"Monica";"You really liked it?"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone)"
"Monica";"Oh really!"
"Chandler";"Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!"
"Monica";"No!"
"Chandler";"Did somebody sign your bra?"
"Monica";"So I got it when I was 13..."
"Phoebe";"Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?"
"Ross";"It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize."
"Phoebe";"Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd."
"Ross";"Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited."
"Phoebe";"You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny..."
"Ross";"And sexy."
"Phoebe";"Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!"
"Ross";"Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her."
"Phoebe";"Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!"
"Ross";"Stop going through my stuff (walks away)!"
"Rachel";"(to Monica) Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Rachel";"I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey."
"Monica";"No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea."
"Rachel";"Please, what about you and Chandler?"
"Monica";"That's different! I was drunk and stupid!"
"Rachel";"Well hello (points to herself)!"
"Monica";"What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?"
"Rachel";"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!"
"Monica";"Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision."
"Rachel";"(pause) I'm gonna do it."
"Monica";"And I can't stop you."
"Rachel";"No."
"Ross";"(to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?"
"Ross";"I'm smarter than"
"Phoebe";"Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler."
"Chandler";"Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you."
"Monica";"Oh, you're so wonderful."
"Bitter woman";"Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period."
"Chandler";"Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away)."
"Monica";"It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?   I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie."
"Ross";"Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But"
"Chandler";"I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?"
"Ross";"Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did"
"Rachel";"I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls   at the party, GOD!"
"Ross";"Why do you care so much?"
"Monica";"Yes Rachel, why"
"Rachel";"(worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know...   and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying   is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common."
"Ross";"Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each   other's tonsils..."
"Phoebe";"Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids   and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh,   those nerds will get"
"Rachel";"All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean..."
"Ross";"Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with   it..."
"Ross";"Oh, God. I forgot how"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"All";"Hi!"
"Ross";"I'm gonna get some more coffee."
"Charlie";"Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!"
"Ross";"Ok. (they both go)"
"Chandler";"(to Joey) So, a professor, uh?"
"Joey";"Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious   (which, being Joey, he mispronounces "amonious"). (pause) That's not   how she used it...?"
"Charlie";"(talking to Ross) I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't   ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed.   I really hope you don't think less of me."
"Ross";"Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean,   you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like   someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people."
"Charlie";"You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean,   Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors,   and intellectuals, and"
"Ross";"Yeah, I know the type."
"Joey";"Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious.   No? Am I getting close?"
"Phoebe";"(entering) Hey!"
"Monica";"Hey!"
"Phoebe";"Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of   slippers)"
"Rachel";"Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?"
"Phoebe";"I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania   Twain."
"Rachel";"(after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!"
"Phoebe";"Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)"
"Monica";"Hey, what's this?"
"Rachel";"Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO."
"Monica";"Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage   chains."
"Rachel";"Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things   that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting..."
"Monica";"Do you wanna go hunting?"
"Rachel";"Well, I would like to have the option!!"
"Phoebe";"(coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift   certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!"
"Rachel";"Oh!"
"Phoebe";"No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big   massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!"
"Monica";"And she wants to go hunting, too!!"
"Rachel";"Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing   away a hundred bucks!"
"Phoebe";"Ok, this is not about the"
"Rachel";"I don't care about any of that!!"
"Phoebe";"Well, do you care about friendship?"
"Rachel";"Oh!"
"Phoebe";"I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use   this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend."
"Rachel";"Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!"
"Phoebe";"Promise?"
"Rachel";"I promise."
"Phoebe";"Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)"
"Rachel";"But I am going hunting!!"
"Monica";"(entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!"
"Chandler";"Oh, yeah?"
"Monica";"Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight?"
"Chandler";"Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the   table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)"
"Monica";"Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience!   Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need   to keep your tadpoles in the tank."
"Chandler";"We really need to take those tests?"
"Monica";"Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think   it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests."
"Chandler";"But I don't wanna do it in a cup!"
"Monica";"What is the big deal?"
"Chandler";"It's weird! In a doctor's office?"
"Monica";"It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do   it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?"
"Chandler";"(embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause)   And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!"
"Monica";"Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think   it's a good idea!"
"Chandler";"Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than   on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!"
"Monica";"(really embarrassed) OH!"
"Chandler";"Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!"
"Joey";"(sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost   more than milk!"
"Joey";"Heeey!"
"Charlie";"Hi!"
"Joey";"Come on in, how are ya?"
"Charlie";"I'm good!"
"Joey";"Can I offer you a drink?"
"Joey";"Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to   open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!"
"Charlie";"So I am just so excited to be   here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!"
"Joey";"Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)"
"Charlie";"Oh, you mean it? That would be so"
"Joey";"Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?"
"Charlie";"Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher   Hall."
"Joey";"(looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!"
"Charlie";"And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display   at the public library."
"Joey";"I know, yeah!"
"Charlie";"And first, I have to see the MET!"
"Joey";"Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna   see the Yankees."
"Charlie";"No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!"
"Joey";"Which one, they all suck!"
"Charlie";"The museum!"
"Joey";"(looking puzzled) I don't think so."
"Rachel";"(to the receptionist) Hi there!"
"Receptionist";"(in an affected tone) Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa   SPA. How may I help you?"
"Rachel";"Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and   here is my gift certificate."
"Receptionist";"This has been torn up."
"Rachel";"And... taped back together."
"Receptionist";"Ok well, I'll call you as   soon as your massage therapist is ready."
"Rachel";"Ok"
"Receptionist";"Have a seat through the glass doors."
"Rachel";"(imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors."
"Receptionist";"Through the glass doors."
"Rachel";"Alright-y then."
"Receptionist";"Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room."
"Phoebe";"Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She   sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone   who can fill in for me?"
"Receptionist";"Sorry, everyone is booked!"
"Phoebe";"But that woman can't know I work   here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this   massage chains are."
"Receptionist";"Then why you work here?"
"Phoebe";"'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that   this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!"
"Receptionist";"Well, I think this is a great place to work!"
"Phoebe";"(watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?"
"Joey";"Ross!"
"Ross";"Hi!"
"Joey";"I need to talk to you about Charlie."
"Ross";"(annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really?"
"Joey";"Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem."
"Ross";"Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious"   means, just don't use it!"
"Joey";"No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her   body is soo..."
"Ross";"Get to the problem!"
"Joey";"Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've   ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!"
"Ross";"(looking down) Are you wearing two belts?"
"Joey";"(checking) EH, what do you know!"
"Ross";"You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid."
"Joey";"Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural   places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!"
"Ross";"You know, I really don't want to   get involved in you guy's relationship."
"Joey";"Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really   like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her."
"Ross";"(after a short hesitation) Fine."
"Joey";"Thanks."
"Ross";"Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!"
"Joey";"The Metsss!"
"Ross";"Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art."
"Joey";"(realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're   gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum,   and avoid all the confusion!"
"Ross";"Yeah, most of it it's a place"
"Joey";"Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET."
"Ross";"Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore   on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture,   you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the   Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that   she'd love."
"Joey";"Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!"
"Ross";"But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for   Thai food..."
"Joey";"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go"
"Ross";"Ok."
"Joey";"You got to tell me exactly what to do there."
"Ross";"Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities   wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire."
"Joey";"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make   the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the   right and Joey nods)"
"Chandler";"I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I   know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet."
"Monica";"Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody   is gonna wanna watch that."
"Nurse";"Mr. Bing? (Chandler jumps up) Here you are! You'll go into that   room and deposit your specimen into the container."
"Chandler";"Deposit my specimen? You know,   usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind   of talk. Thanks, got it."
"Monica";"Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going   to be ok?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, I guess!"
"Monica";"I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even   knows you!"
"Janice";"OH MY GOD!!"
"Chandler";"Oh, Come on!"
"Janice";"Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!"
"Monica";"Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!"
"Chandler";"Why are you here?"
"Janice";"Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time   because apparently we..."
"Chandler";"(to Heaven) No no no... I mean,"
"Janice";"Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz   they have to do it in a cup! (laughs) Oh! They gave you the kiddy size (looking   at the cup in his hand)."
"Chandler";"What!?"
"Monica";"This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!   (leaves)"
"Chandler";"I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got   a hot date... (starts to leave)"
"Janice";"Please... go! (Then shouts after him) Just let me know if you   need a hand!"
"Chandler";"(disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)"
"Phoebe";"(In a strange heavy accent) Hello "ja", it's time   for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole."
"Rachel";"Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her   head in the hole and Phoebe enters)"
"Phoebe";"Okay, then I'm Swedish..."
"Monica";"So, what's your name?"
"Phoebe";"It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea..."
"Rachel";"Oh... what an interesting name."
"Phoebe";"Ja!"
"Rachel";"You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's   direction)"
"Phoebe";"(pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!"
"Rachel";"(Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love   your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)"
"Phoebe";"Is something wrong?"
"Rachel";"No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause)   Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?"
"Phoebe";"(Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm."
"Rachel";"Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!"
"Joey";"(gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly   lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors   as his elusive subject was light itself."
"Ross";"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?"
"Joey";"(shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth   says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!"
"Ross";"Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt   M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you."
"Joey";"Phonetically? (Looks confused)"
"Ross";"Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time   for this."
"Joey";"Ok."
"Ross";"Ok, but you know what? I gotta say,   I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"
"Joey";"Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"   I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy"."
"Ross";"Wow. What does"
"Joey";"No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I   guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear"."
"Ross";"Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?"
"Joey";"Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish   of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the   imaginary painting)."
"Ross";"Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing   and dude, you can't"
"Joey";"Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)"
"Ross";"No! (Slaps his hand)"
"Chandler";"(To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the   room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.   Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees   Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?"
"Janice";"Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so   this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?"
"Chandler";"Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!"
"Janice";"That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes   next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?"
"Chandler";"I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...   I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok."
"Janice";"Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is."
"Chandler";"(Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there   is a reason why we can't have a baby?"
"Janice";"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.   I am sure it's gonna be just fine."
"Chandler";"(smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe   I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to...   come here and do... 'that'..."
"Janice";"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you   can't do it at a doctor's office?"
"Chandler";"(stares at her intently, then yells) It was a "Wendy's!!   ""
"Phoebe";"(Singing) "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is   the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)"
"Rachel";"Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have   a friend who is a masseuse."
"Phoebe";"Oh, Ja! Ja!"
"Rachel";"Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated)"
"Phoebe";"Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?"
"Rachel";"I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy   fingers from playing crummy guitar..."
"Phoebe";"Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're   such a high maintenance tight ass!"
"Rachel";"(now lifts her head) Phoebe!!"
"Phoebe";"You know it's me?"
"Rachel";"For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!"
"Phoebe";"How can you come here?"
"Rachel";"How could you not tell me you worked here?"
"Phoebe";"I don't have to tell you everything!"
"Rachel";"Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting   a free massage!"
"Phoebe";"Tips not included."
"Rachel";"Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?"
"Phoebe";"Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then   they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know...   you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and"
"Rachel";"Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there   right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles   and I"
"Phoebe";"You know what? You are right. I"
"Rachel";"Good for you Pheebs!"
"Phoebe";"Ok."
"Phoebe";"Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and   whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean"
"Ross";"Haha! Got ya! Die, die,"
"Ross";"(recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor   R. Geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the   sofa) Hey!"
"Charlie";"Hi!"
"Ross";"Hey, how was the Met?"
"Charlie";"The museum was amazing!"
"Ross";"Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?"
"Charlie";"Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to   say, and some of it didn't even make any sense."
"Ross";"What do you mean?"
"Charlie";"Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere   around."
"Ross";"(perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked   into the Met, did you go to the right?"
"Charlie";"No, we went to the left."
"Ross";"(shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like   you guys are having a great time together."
"Charlie";"Yeah, it's fun (hesitating)."
"Ross";"What?"
"Charlie";"Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really   know me that well; it would be weird."
"Ross";"What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on."
"Charlie";"Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy   to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common   with. You know what I mean?"
"Ross";"(slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey   a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about   art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else."
"Charlie";"Yeah, I guess that's true."
"Ross";"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all   that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You   know, that's the kind of guy Joey is."
"Charlie";"He is very sweet. Plus he's"
"Ross";"That was going to be my next argument."
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Charlie";"Hey!"
"Joey";"(to Charlie) You're ready?"
"Charlie";"Yeah, let's go. (stands up and kisses Joey) (to Ross) Thanks   Ross."
"Joey";"(aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me   up."
"Ross";"Glad I could help man."
"Joey";"Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna   be, but... (confidently) I made it work."
"Chandler";"(picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited   his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now."
"Chandler";"Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here   but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile   fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause)   Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)"
"Monica";"Hey sweetie."
"Chandler";"Doctor Connelly just called."
"Monica";"With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course   it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) "Doctor Connelly just called".   If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) "Doctor Connelly just   called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem   with me or with you?"
"Chandler";"Actually it's both of us."
"Monica";"What?"
"Chandler";"Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable   environment."
"Monica";"Oh... what does that mean?"
"Chandler";"It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers   and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It   means..."
"Monica";"Chandler?"
"Chandler";"(seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's   a good chance this may never happen for us."
"Monica";"(weeping) Oh my God!"
"Chandler";"I'm sorry."
"Monica";"I'm sorry too."
"Chandler";"Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out."
"Monica";"(still weeping) I know."
"Receptionist";"Good morning Phoebe."
"Phoebe";"(imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist."
"Receptionist";"Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is   in room No. 1."
"Phoebe";"Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back?"
"Phoebe";"(through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for   your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy."
"Charlie";"(while Joey's giving her a massage) Oh! That feels sooo good!"
"Rachel";"(speaking to herself and reading Cosmopolitan) Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!"
"Charlie";"I'm sorry, what?"
"Rachel";"Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma."
"Charlie";"From... Cosmo??"
"Rachel";"Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin"."
"Charlie";"(to Joey) So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!"
"Joey";"So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good."
"Rachel";"(hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!"
"Joey";"Oh hey Rach!"
"Rachel";"Yeah..."
"Joey";"Maybe you could take Charlie shopping."
"Rachel";"Oh, well..."
"Charlie";"I'm sure you have better things to do."
"Joey";"Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes."
"Charlie";"If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help."
"Rachel";"Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!"
"Joey";"(to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!"
"Phoebe";"(entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok, great! All right, bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) That's off, right?"
"Joey";"What's the matter, Pheebs?"
"Phoebe";"Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!"
"Rachel";"Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"
"Phoebe";"Exactly!"
"Rachel";"And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!"
"Phoebe";"(after a short pause) I didn't even think about that! (pause) Aaargh,"
"Rachel";"Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something."
"Phoebe";"Ok, that'll be great!"
"Joey";"Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together."
"Rachel";"That's not what we're gonna do!"
"Joey";"Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?"
"Chandler";"(looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a"
"Monica";"Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!"
"Chandler";"Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!"
"Doctor Connelly";"(entering) Hi there."
"Chandler";"Hi."
"Monica";"Hi."
"Doctor Connelly";"I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options."
"Monica";"Ok."
"Doctor Connelly";"Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis."
"Chandler";"Oh, DAMN IT!"
"Monica";"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out."
"Doctor Connelly";"Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor."
"Monica";"(long pause) Ok."
"Doctor Connelly";"And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt."
"Chandler";"Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!"
"Rachel";"Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?"
"Charlie";"Oh, yeah! Let's do it!"
"Joey";"(to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)"
"Rachel";"Not gonna find any clothes in there!"
"Ross";"(entering) Hey, you guys!"
"Rachel";"Hi."
"Ross";"Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?"
"Charlie";"Umh... Kurts Baley?"
"Ross";"Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh, then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well, why are you laughing?"
"Joey";"Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!"
"Charlie";"So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?"
"Ross";"Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today."
"Charlie";"He's a pretty tough guy to impress."
"Ross";"Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him."
"Rachel";"Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?"
"Ross";"Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve)."
"Chandler";"(entering) Hey guys!"
"Ross";"Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me."
"Chandler";"I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick."
"Ross";"It's in Barbados."
"Chandler";"But you come first!"
"Rachel";"I'm there!"
"Charlie";"We'll see you, guys! (she goes)"
"Joey";"Bye."
"Rachel";"Bye, see ya. (she goes)"
"Chandler";"(sitting down on the couch) Ok."
"Joey";"All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?"
"Chandler";"Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample."
"Ross";"So-so what did the doctor say?"
"Chandler";"Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her."
"Joey";"So you're ruling out surrogacy?"
"Chandler";"Yeah."
"Joey";"So, I don't have to learn what that means?"
"Chandler";"Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors."
"Joey";"Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?"
"Chandler";"(stopping Joey) ah-ha!"
"Ross";"How do you feel about all this?"
"Chandler";"I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one."
"Joey";"Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!"
"Ross";"(puzzled) What?"
"Ross";"(looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!"
"Ross";"The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering."
"Professor Sherman";"Mmm-mm."
"Ross";"(reading from a notepad) I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!"
"Ross";"Oh, that's not what you want..."
"Shop assistant";"(to a girl) Incentive For Men?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, I'll take some of that."
"Rachel";"Pheebs, that's for men!"
"Phoebe";"No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah."
"Phoebe";"Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!"
"Charlie";"(to Rachel) So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?"
"Rachel";"On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here."
"Charlie";"See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a "thank you", I would really love to take you out."
"Rachel";"Really?"
"Charlie";"Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?"
"Rachel";"Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them."
"Charlie";"You've seen"
"Rachel";"Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!"
"Phoebe";"(picks up a dress) Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?"
"Rachel";"Sure!"
"Phoebe";"Ok!"
"Charlie";"Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!"
"Rachel";"You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff."
"Phoebe";"So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?"
"Rachel";"She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!"
"Phoebe";"Why?"
"Rachel";"I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!"
"Phoebe";"Who else?"
"Rachel";"Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom..."
"Phoebe";"You like Joey?"
"Rachel";"Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him."
"Phoebe";"(whispering) Oh my God!"
"Rachel";"It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!"
"Phoebe";"Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?"
"Rachel";"(annoyed) Oh, I get it!"
"Phoebe";"Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right."
"Rachel";"I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal."
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Rachel";"So can we keep this between us?"
"Phoebe";"Sure!"
"Rachel";"Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!"
"Phoebe";"Oh."
"Phoebe";"Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?"
"Monica";"Hi honey!"
"Chandler";"Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!"
"Monica";"Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!"
"Zack";"(shaking Monica's hand) You too."
"Chandler";"You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer."
"Monica";"I got it."
"Zack";"Thanks."
"Chandler";"(to Mon) So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?"
"Monica";"Yeah, I guess."
"Chandler";"So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!"
"Monica";"(turns around and she's quite shocked) Excuse me?"
"Chandler";"Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!"
"Monica";"Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!"
"Chandler";"No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out."
"Monica";"Chandler!"
"Chandler";"I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!"
"Monica";"I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!"
"Chandler";"Ok!"
"Monica";"Uh!"
"Chandler";"(bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!"
"Zack";"Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring."
"very";"very"
"Monica";"Tell me about yourself, Zack!"
"Rachel";"Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!"
"Phoebe";"Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me."
"Rachel";"Ok, great!"
"Rachel";"Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!"
"Phoebe";"(sticks her head out) I didn't say anything yet!"
"Rachel";"(sticks her head out too) Well, get back in there and talk!"
"Phoebe";"(goes back in) I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends."
"Rachel";"(comes out again) What!?"
"Phoebe";"(comes out too) Well, some things are just hard to say to your face."
"Rachel";"Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!"
"Phoebe";"Ooh! We have a problem."
"Rachel";"Oh! What are we gonna do?"
"Stranger";"Just be honest with her."
"Rachel";"Oh my God!"
"Stranger";"And it"
"Rachel";"(yelling at the stranger) Alright! Enough out of you!"
"Joey";"Hello?"
"Ross";"Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?"
"Joey";"No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?"
"Ross";"I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker..."
"Joey";"Oh! How's it going?"
"Ross";"It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!"
"Joey";"What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!"
"Ross";"Barbados."
"Joey";"Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!"
"Ross";"What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder."
"Joey";"Well, just wake him up!"
"Ross";"I can't! If he realizes that"
"Joey";"Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was"
"Monica";"Hey guys! Dinner's ready!"
"Zack";"Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first. (Chandler points him the bathroom) Thanks!"
"Chandler";"So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!"
"Monica";"Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain"
"Chandler";"You don't like him."
"Monica";"I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything"
"Chandler";"Alright! Just follow my lead!"
"Zack";"You guys have such a great place here."
"Chandler";"Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?"
"Zack";"Uhm... no. Although I"
"Chandler";"(very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack."
"Zack";"(looking very puzzled) Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet."
"Monica";"Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?"
"Zack";"(after a pause, very confused) No..."
"Monica";"Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?"
"Zack";"You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?"
"Monica";"We're just making conversation. (Chandler makes an agreeing-sound)"
"Zack";"Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny..."
"Chandler";"You know what's"
"Zack";"Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?"
"Monica & Chandler";"Sure! Alright..."
"Zack";"Ravioli's delicious!"
"Chandler";"I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?"
"Zack";"No I didn't."
"Monica";"Yess!! (M & C high-five and Zack looks confused again)"
"Chandler";"(Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!"
"Rachel";"Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard."
"Phoebe";"Good plan."
"Rachel";"Ok. (Phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. Rachel sees and follows her) Wha...? where? Where are you going?"
"Phoebe";"Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"! (at which she walks away)"
"Rachel";"(to Charlie) Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?"
"Charlie";"Oh! trying on clothes."
"Rachel";"(pretends to be stunned) Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!"
"Charlie";"(smiling) Rachel... I heard you guys whispering."
"Rachel";"Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain."
"Charlie";"No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey."
"Rachel";"(after a pause) Yeah."
"Charlie";"It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?"
"Rachel";"Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!"
"Charlie";"Wow!"
"Rachel";"Yeah..."
"Charlie";"You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person."
"Rachel";"(Looks ashamed) I try..."
"Ross";"(To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want"
"Prof. Sherman";"(confused) You're welcome. (Ross hugs him again)"
"Joey";"(impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! Which is like the"
"Phoebe";"Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party."
"Joey";"Then don't go!"
"Phoebe";"Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture."
"Joey";"Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!"
"Phoebe";"You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room."
"Phoebe";"David?"
"David";"Phoebe! Hi!"
"Phoebe";"Oh my God! (they hug)"
"David";"Wow, you look unbelievable."
"Phoebe";"Yeah. What-what are you doing here?"
"David";"Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently."
"Phoebe";"What happened?"
"David";"Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah?"
"David";"Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done."
"Phoebe";"Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?"
"David";"Good, good, life is good..."
"Phoebe";"Good!"
"David";"Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone."
"Phoebe";"(disappointed) Oh, good for you."
"David";"She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that"."
"Phoebe";"Mike and I broke up."
"David";"You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up."
"Phoebe";"Really?"
"David";"Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face."
"Phoebe";"I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!"
"David";"Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?"
"Phoebe";"Well... (pause) no."
"David";"Do you wanna get a drink?"
"Phoebe";"I'd love to."
"David";"Great."
"Phoebe";"Ok. (they walk away together)"
"David";"Do you smell beets?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, got it, stay upwind of me."
"Charlie";"Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?"
"Rachel";"No, that's David."
"Charlie";"There's a third guy?"
"Rachel";"(disapprovingly) Tip of the iceberg."
"Zack";"I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?"
"Chandler";"You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?"
"Zack";"No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired."
"Chandler";"Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression."
"Zack";"No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow."
"Chandler";"Ok."
"Chandler";"I think we've found our sperm!"
"Monica";"Does seem pretty perfect."
"Chandler";"Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?"
"Monica";"(pause) No."
"Chandler";"Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!"
"Monica";"No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you."
"Chandler";"Yeah, he's better!"
"Monica";"No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else."
"Chandler";"Really? Are you sure?"
"Monica";"Yeah, I'm sure."
"Chandler";"(sighs with relief) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm."
"Monica";"That is so sweet. I love you. (they kiss)"
"Chandler";"So you know this leaves us with..."
"Monica";"Adoption."
"Chandler";"How do you feel about that?"
"Monica";"I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it."
"Chandler";"Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way."
"Monica";"So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?"
"Chandler";"(smiling) Yeah."
"Monica";"(excitedly) Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!"
"Chandler";"We are gonna be"
"Monica";"And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there (they go look through the window) our baby could be being conceived."
"Chandler";"Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!"
"Chandler";"Hey, Zack!"
"Zack";"(hardly enthusiastic) Hey Chandler."
"Chandler";"Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable."
"Zack";"No you didn't."
"Chandler";"Really?"
"Zack";"No you did."
"Chandler";"My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it."
"Jeanette";"(to Zack) Here are the boards for Friday's pitch (hands him something)."
"Zack";"Oh, thank you."
"Chandler";"You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?"
"Joey";"(entering) Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!"
"Ross";"Oh, that's right! (to Emma) Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?"
"Joey";"Mmh-mmh."
"Ross";"(to Emma) Can you say Barbados?"
"Joey";"Barbados!"
"Ross";"Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the"
"Rachel";"Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?"
"Chandler";"Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff"."
"Phoebe";"I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures."
"Ross";"Oh, right, because he's a scientist!"
"Phoebe";"No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die."
"Ross";"Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow."
"Joey";"All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally."
"Ross";"It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!"
"Charlie";"Wow! This place is beautiful!"
"Ross";"(very excited) Look at all these paleontologists!!"
"Joey";"I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (A woman goes towards them)"
"Woman";"Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!"
"Joey";"(to Charlie) I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!"
"Woman";"Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!"
"Joey";"That... never happens..."
"Woman";"I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech."
"Ross";"Wow! This is very flattering, uh..."
"Woman";"I would love your autograph. (hands him a notepad)"
"Ross";"Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... "Dear..." (he takes the notepad)"
"Woman";"Sarah."
"Ross";""... Sarah. I"
"Sarah";"Thank you so much!"
"Ross";"Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani."
"Sarah";"(to Joey) Are you a paleontologist?"
"Joey";"No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives"."
"Ross";"Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives"... there's no"
"Joey";"(thinking he's kidding) Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray."
"Sarah";"I'm sorry, I don't own a TV."
"Joey";"You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??"
"Monica";"David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air."
"David";"Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion."
"Monica";"(to Chandler) See?"
"Chandler";"Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind"."
"Monica";"Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip."
"Phoebe";"Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there."
"David";"Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!"
"Phoebe";"That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!"
"David";"It's ok. Ho-honest mistake."
"Phoebe";"Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard"
"Chandler";"(upset) She does?"
"Monica";"(pinching her) Let's get you out of here!! (they go outside)"
"Monica";"At least you took me down with you!"
"Phoebe";"I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?"
"Monica";"I guess, in time."
"Phoebe";"Yeah."
"Monica";"I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone."
"Phoebe";"You just did it again."
"David";"(to Chandler) Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?"
"Chandler";"I wouldn't read too much into it."
"David";"Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?"
"Chandler";"David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."
"David";"Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe..."
"Chandler";"Seriously, we're gonna do this?"
"David";"I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?"
"Chandler";"Oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Oh, I'm sorry,"
"David";"That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!"
"Chandler";"What?"
"David";"Well, I was probably going to do it at some point."
"Chandler";"I didn't mean"
"David";"Why not? It's brilliant! (talking to an imaginary Mike) Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella! (pause) well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding... (to Chandler) Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely."
"Chandler";"Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help."
"David";"(after a while) How do you think I should propose?"
"Chandler";"David, I'm pretending to"
"Joey";"Yeah! How"
"Joey";"Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?"
"Charlie";"(laughing) I didn't mean"
"Joey";"You really should have been more clear about that!"
"Ross";"Hey!"
"Joey";"Hey!"
"Ross";"(Excited) You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!"
"Joey";"Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?"
"Ross";"Yeah, she"
"Charlie";"Oh my God! Did you talk to him?"
"Ross";"Yeah... what am"
"Joey";"You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?" (looks at Ross matter-of-factly)"
"Ross";"(to Charlie) Ready to go?"
"Charlie";"Yeah!"
"Joey";"Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?"
"Charlie";"Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech."
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Charlie";"But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic."
"Joey";"(smiling) Will you wear a thong?"
"Charlie";"I will if you will."
"Joey";"Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!"
"Ross";"(a little embarassed by their conversation) I'm good, I have dinner plans (moves away from them)."
"Charlie";"So you'll be ok?"
"Joey";"Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming..."
"Ross";"Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?"
"Joey";"No, why?"
"Joey";"Oh man!"
"Charlie";"There's an indoor pool, you can swim there! (Ross agrees)"
"Joey";"I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! (removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)"
"Monica";"Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David."
"Chandler";"(smiling cheekily) I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" (Monica looks confused, so Chandler repeats) "I do"."
"Monica";"Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee."
"Chandler";"David is going to propose to Phoebe."
"Monica";"What? (looks very shocked) Why?"
"Chandler";"Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married."
"Monica";"Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?"
"Chandler";"I"
"Monica";"They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone"
"Chandler";"Man, that's some"
"Joey";"Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!"
"Rachel";"Hey! Hey what's going on?"
"Joey";"Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and"
"Rachel";"Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!"
"Monica";"Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a"
"Chandler";"That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!"
"Joey";"Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in (Joey, Chandler and David leave)"
"Monica";"(to Chandler) Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!"
"Phoebe";"(shouts after David) Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!"
"Monica";"(shouts to Chandler) And make sure our room isn't next to theirs (points to Phoebe)."
"Rachel";"Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could (looks at Joey who is at the check in desk) share that with a guy."
"Rachel";"Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler."
"Monica";"Yeah, right!"
"David";"So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight. (Removes a ring box from his pocket and opens it to show Chandler the ring)"
"Chandler";"Tonight?! (looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) Oh, there it is!"
"David";"Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor."
"Chandler";"(slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica)"
"Chandler";"Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? (Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)"
"Monica";"Ok!"
"Chandler";"David is going to propose to Phoebe"
"Monica";"See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?"
"Chandler";"That would be advice!!"
"Monica";"Ok fine. I'll handle this. (goes to Phoebe who's talking to Rachel) Phoebe?"
"Phoebe";"Yeah?"
"Monica";"(looking very serious) I need to talk to you."
"Phoebe";"Are you leaving "The Supremes"? (Monica and Phoebe go to one side)"
"MOnica";"Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight."
"Phoebe";"Wow? Really? That's fantastic!"
"Monica";"What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?"
"Phoebe";"Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and"
"Monica";"Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?"
"Phoebe";"Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike..."
"Ross";"By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century."
"Charlie";"It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference."
"Ross";"Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (Someone knocks on the door, Ross goes to open and it's Joey, Rachel and Chandler)."
"Joey";"Hey guys!"
"Ross";"The chocolates aren't here yet."
"Joey";"Damnit!"
"Charlie";"Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!"
"Chandler";"Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?"
"Ross";"If you want to check your email, just ask! (Chandler tries to look offended)"
"Chandler";"(offended) What? (pause) May I?"
"Rachel";"(looking out the window) What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season."
"Charlie";"Actually the wet season is June to December."
"Rachel";"It's not the time Charlie."
"Chandler";"(at the laptop) Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!"
"Joey";"Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (Chandler looks annoyed at him and Joey leans in to him) Oh!"
"Chandler";"Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!"
"Ross";"Wha... what do you mean? (Goes to the laptop)"
"Chandler";"It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive."
"Ross";"What, oh my God. What did you do?"
"Chandler";"Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it."
"Ross";"Why, why would you open it?"
"Chandler";"Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!"
"Ross";"What"
"Chandler";"Nude... (Ross looks at him)... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry."
"Ross";"What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!"
"Chandler";"It's not"
"Ross";"NO! I don't!!"
"Chandler";"Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!"
"Joey";"It's really gone?"
"Ross";"Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!"
"Chandler";"I just feel awful."
"Ross";"Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!"
"Chandler";"Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... (Ross glares at him) you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)"
"Ross";"Get out! (Chandler runs out)"
"Rachel";"You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work."
"Ross";"Well, what do"
"Rachel";"Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer."
"Ross";"I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?"
"Joey";"I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions."
"Ross";"I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!"
"Charlie";"Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!"
"Ross";"Wha... what you really think we can do that?"
"Charlie";"Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner (Looks at Joey)."
"Joey";"Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can."
"Rachel";"Ugh."
"Ross";"Alright, ok, let's do it. (Ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! (Rachel and Joey look confused) And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic."
"Joey";"Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a "Galaxy far, far away"? (Ross turns aroud and glares at him. Joey and Rachel decide to leave)."
"Mike";"Hello?"
"Monica";"Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!"
"Mike";"Who is this?"
"Monica";"This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!"
"Mike";"(sounds shocked and sits down) He... he's gonna propose?"
"Monica";"I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair! (Tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)"
"Mike";"Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you."
"Monica";"You don't tell me what to do! I tell"
"Monica";"(sarcastically) Well, I hope you're happy!"
"Chandler";"(pretending not to sense the tone) Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!"
"Monica";"Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!"
"Chandler";"Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!"
"Monica";"No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!"
"Chandler";"And there's not chance that will work?"
"Monica";"No, I called him. It's not gonna happen."
"Chandler";"(pointing at her) Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!"
"Monica";"Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!"
"Chandler";"This vacation sucks!!"
"Joey";"I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything."
"Rachel";"Well, I've brought some books. We could read."
"Joey";"Hey, it hasn't come to that yet."
"Joey";"(stopping the waiter) Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!"
"Waiter";"I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention (walks away)"
"Joey";"Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?"
"Rachel";"We can't. We're not pharmacists!"
"Joey";"(walking to a table with many badges on it) I know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) Frank Medeio and... (picks up another badge) Eva Trorro... womba..."
"Rachel";"(picking up another random badge) Kate Miller?"
"Joey";"Kate Miller it is. (he picks up the Kate Miller badge and sticks it on Rachel's breast)"
"Rachel";"And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend."
"Joey";"In that case should I make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)"
"Rachel";"Thank you. (they walk away)"
"Charlie";"And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century."
"Ross";"Yeah, that's it?"
"Charlie";"Yeah."
"Ross";"Oh my God, we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)"
"Charlie";"Actually"
"Ross";"Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. (he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) That's a pretty necklace."
"Charlie";"Thank you."
"Ross";"Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)"
"Charlie";"Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you."
"Ross";"Oh my God, I love you."
"Charlie";"Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?"
"Ross";"That's Ben, my son from my first marriage."
"Charlie";"Your first marriage?"
"Ross";"Yeah."
"Charlie";"You're married more than once?"
"Ross";"No. (they clink glasses and drink)"
"Charlie";"So, why did you break up?"
"Ross";"(embarassed) Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay."
"Charlie";"Oh my God, this is so cool!"
"Ross";"Ok, odd thing to get excited about!"
"Charlie";"No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!"
"Ross";"Hey! High-five! (they high-five)"
"Charlie";"Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner."
"Ross";"My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter."
"Charlie";"Right and then everybody finds out and they're like: "Oh, I knew all along""
"Ross";"I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: "Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay""
"Charlie";"I know!"
"Ross";"And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?"
"Charlie";"I didn't do that."
"Ross";"(embarassed) Me neither."
"Joey";"Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun."
"Rachel";"I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home."
"Joey";"Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?"
"Rachel";"Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts..."
"Joey";"But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?"
"Rachel";"(takes a sip from her drink, embarassed) No."
"Joey";"There it is, you're blushing!"
"Rachel";"No, I'm not"
"Joey";"You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? (tickles her a little)"
"Rachel";"No."
"Joey";"Tell me who it is."
"Rachel";"Joey! (she walks away; Joey goes after her teasing and tickling her)"
"Joey";"Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?"
"Rachel";"Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen."
"Joey";"What? Why not? Rach, who can"
"Rachel";"Oh! (pause) Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?"
"Joey";"(eagerly) Yeah, who is that?"
"Rachel";"Do ya?"
"Joey";"Yeah."
"Ross and Charlie";"Hey!"
"Charlie";"(to Joey) I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner."
"Joey";"Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?"
"Ross";"Yep, we got it, we got it. (To Charlie) Thank you so much."
"Charlie";"I had a great time."
"Joey";"Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who..."
"Rachel";"Later! La..."
"Charlie";"So, shall we?"
"Joey";"Yeah. (they leave)"
"Rachel";"Ok. See you, bye."
"Charlie";"Bye."
"Ross";"Good night."
"Joey";"Night."
"Ross and Rachel";"Ok, good night!"
"Monica";"I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike."
"Chandler";"You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that."
"David";"Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say."
"Monica";"Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go."
"Chandler";"I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? (doing David) "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!"
"David";"Uh, Phoebe, uh... (Chandler hits his own head) you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!"
"Phoebe";"Sure, ok, yeah."
"David";"But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end..."
"Phoebe";"Oh my God, Mike!"
"David";"It's David, actually!"
"Phoebe";"No, Mike's here."
"David";"(turns around) Hi Mike!"
"Mike";"Hi David. Chandler. Monica... (Looks at Monica, checking her big hair, aghast) Oh!"
"Monica";"IT'S THE HUMIDITY!"
"Mike";"Hi Phoebe."
"Phoebe";"What are you, what are you doing here?"
"Mike";"I have a question I need to ask you."
"David";"I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself."
"Mike";"Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this."
"David";"(annoyed) Ok, would you care for my seat as well?"
"Mike";"Actually yeah, that'll be great."
"David";"That's fair, you've had a long trip. (he leaves his seat to Mike, and stands there looking for a chair. He finally goes to Monica and Chandler's table)"
"Mike";"Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you."
"David";"Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say."
"Mike";"Sorry David, but she really has to know this."
"David";"Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops."
"Monica";"You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? (Phoebe looks very flattered) Now, I don't actually have a ring..."
"David";"I have a ring."
"Chandler";"I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy."
"David";"Phoebe, will you marry me?"
"Phoebe";"(smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!"
"David";"Uhm... Ha ha!"
"Phoebe";"I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future."
"Mike";"We can have any future you want."
"David";"Ok, I'm gonna take off."
"Phoebe";"David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry."
"David";"Just so I know, if I had asked first..."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong."
"David";"Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip! (he leaves)"
"Mike";"Is it ok if I hug you now?"
"Phoebe";"Yes! (they hug)"
"Monica";"(to everybody) BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?"
"Chandler";"Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day."
"Monica";"I know (she snuggles to him)"
"Rachel";"(walking in hurriedly) Open your drapes! Open your drapes!"
"Chandler";"I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!"
"Monica";"The sun is out!"
"Chandler";"Hey! Remember when I had corneas?"
"Monica";"Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion."
"Chandler";"Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes."
"Rachel";"Nooo!"
"Monica";"Damn it!"
"Ross";"(from across the wall) Walls are pretty thin, guys!"
"Ross";"Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating."
"Rachel";"Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so"
"Ross";"Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus..."
"Chandler";"(to a paleontologist sitting next to him) Not to mention the cold sores."
"Ross";"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development."
"Chandler";"(to the one sitting next to him) Really?"
"Ross";"But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster"
"Charlie";"What?"
"Joey";"He said "erectus"!"
"Charlie";"You're... you're kidding, right?"
"Joey";"No, he really said it."
"Ross";"... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus..."
"Joey";"Erectus?"
"Rachel";"Homo."
"Ross";"(concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) Thank you!"
"Ross";"Oh, thanks guys!"
"Man with a bow tie";"(shaking hands with Ross) I thought... it was wonderful!"
"Ross";"Oh!"
"Man with a bow tie";"Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. (sighs) I mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so..."
"Ross";"(with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something's wrong with Jarvis) Ok... now... now we're just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)"
"Rachel";"All right! Well, uh... (to Monica) we're gonna hit the beach?"
"Monica";"Yeah!"
"Rachel";"(to Ross, in a flattering tone) It was really... great!"
"Ross";"Oh, thank you so much!"
"Joey";"Yeah, and"
"Rachel";"Oh!"
"Ross";"(puzzled) Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! (to Phoebe) Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!"
"Mike";"(popping by, smiling) You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!"
"Mike";"Oh... I'm back!"
"Ross";"(skating over, embarrassed) Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?"
"Phoebe & Mike";"Yeah! (they leave)"
"Ross";"Hey! (she turns to him) Well...? (in expectation)"
"Charlie";"You were incredible!"
"Ross";"Yeah?"
"Charlie";"You blew them away!"
"Ross";"Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?"
"Charlie";"(smiling broadly) I was"
"Ross";"No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!"
"Charlie";"Oh my God! (pauses) I'm your"
"Ross";"(joking) I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!"
"Ross";"(realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling) Look, I took it too far!"
"Monica";"(her hair bigger then before) I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!"
"Phoebe";"Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (Grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) Not you guys. You got it going on!"
"Monica";"So, what are we gonna do today?"
"Mike";"They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff."
"Monica";"(pleasantly surprised) Ping pong? (to Chandler) Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!"
"Chandler";"I don't think so!"
"Monica";"(disappointed) Why not?"
"Chandler";"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!"
"Monica";"I'm not always that bad!"
"Chandler";"Oh,"
"Monica";"(hesitatingly) I punched you...?"
"Chandler";"And...?"
"Monica";"... Phoebe...?"
"Phoebe";"... and...?"
"Monica";"I clunked your heads together!"
"Charlie";"(walking in) Hey! There you are!"
"Joey";"Hey! (stands up) As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it"
"Charlie";"I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon."
"Joey";"(disappointed) Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you..."
"Charlie";"You know... I feel so"
"Joey";"(interrupting her) Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... (pulls a face)"
"Charlie";"Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!"
"Joey";"(bewildered) Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!"
"Charlie";"Yeah..."
"Charlie";"... is it weird that it's not with each other?"
"Joey";"Yeah! A little bit, yeah..."
"Charlie";"(sitting down on the bed) I think we need to talk...!"
"Joey";"Yeah... I think we do... (sighs, with folded arms)... about what?"
"Monica";"C'mon guys, it'll be fun!"
"Phoebe";"All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!"
"Monica";"But then how do we know who wins?"
"Phoebe";"Nobody wins!"
"Monica";"So, we're just four losers... SUPER!"
"Chandler";"I'm not playing with you."
"Phoebe";"Yeah, I'm out."
"Mike";"I'll play ya!"
"Monica";"(smiling) OK!"
"Phoebe";"Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!"
"Chandler";"She gets crazy! This scar (points to his forehead) is from"
"Mike";"(disbelieving) I think I will be all right! (to Monica) You wanna volley a bit for a serve?"
"Monica";"Sure! Got to!"
"Monica";"Aww!"
"Mike";"Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!"
"Chandler";"(nearly whispering) Oh dear God, there's two of them!"
"Mike";"You're ready to play?"
"Monica";"Hell, yeah!"
"Chandler";"(to Phoebe) Did you know this about him?"
"Phoebe";"No idea! I though he was soft like you!"
"Mike";"Wanna make it more interesting?"
"Monica";"How much were you thinking?"
"Mike";"Ten bucks a game?"
"Monica";"Make it fifty!"
"Mike";"I'll make it a hundred!"
"Monica";"(nearly shouting) One thousand..."
"Chandler";"(interrupting her) OK!"
"Mike";"To see who goes first, you got a quarter?"
"Monica";"(going through her pockets) No... (to Chandler and Phoebe) Either of you girls got a quarter?"
"Chandler";"Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!"
"Phoebe";"(picks up a coin from her bra) Monica, you call it."
"Monica";"Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!"
"Phoebe";"Tails!"
"Monica";"(angry) Ow, what are the chances!"
"Monica";"Ha! My point!"
"Mike";"Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point."
"Phoebe";"(smiling proudly) He was a lawyer!"
"Alexandra Steele";"(meteorologist) (pointing to the East Coast)... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!"
"Rachel";"Oh! Weather bitch! (turns the TV off)"
"Rachel";"It's open! (Joey walks in) Hi, Joe!"
"Joey";"(downhearted) Hey..."
"Rachel";"(worried) What, is everything ok?"
"Joey";"Uh... Charlie and I broke up."
"Rachel";"Nooooo, why?"
"Joey";"Oh well, she said we have nothing in common."
"Rachel";"(laughing) Oh, that's crazy!"
"Joey";"No, it's not, we have nothing in common!"
"Rachel";"... yeah, it's true."
"Joey";"I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!"
"Rachel";"(pretending to be offended) What, hey!"
"Joey";"(laughing sarcastically) Ok, Rach!"
"Joey";"I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?"
"Rachel";"W-What are you, what are you talking about?"
"Joey";"Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... (sighs) What the hell is my problem? OH! (He falls back on the bed)"
"Rachel";"Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl..."
"Joey";"(sitting up again) I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, I'm not talking about her..."
"Joey";"But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? (gives her a meaningful look)"
"Rachel";"You know? Forget it!"
"Joey";"(stands up) No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?"
"Rachel";"No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know"
"Joey";"Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!"
"Rachel";"Yeah, sure!"
"Joey";"You like me? (shuts the door)"
"Rachel";"(nearly whispering) Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!"
"Joey";"(shocked) That's a"
"Rachel";"Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts (pauses) musings, if you will!"
"Joey";"What... for how long?"
"Rachel";"Only like a month!"
"Joey";"(outraged) A MONTH??"
"Rachel";"What the... DIAL IT DOWN! (Joey goes to sit on the bed) Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know,"
"Joey";"(stands up) I just have one question!"
"Rachel";"Shoot!"
"Joey";"(desperate) What the hell are you doin'???"
"Rachel";"I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... (insinuating) what that would be like?..."
"Joey";"Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!"
"Rachel";"(puzzled) Who...?"
"Joey";"CURIOUS GEORGE ("
"Rachel";"Oh yes, of course, I remember him!"
"Joey";"Yeah, he had a paper route."
"Rachel";"Yeah, he did! (smiling) Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!"
"Joey";"No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!"
"Rachel";"But can it... just... happen a little bit?"
"Joey";"(charmed, but then recoiling) NO, NO! It can't happen at all!"
"Rachel";"But why, why not?"
"Joey";"Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? (in a trembling voice) I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once"
"Rachel";"But that wasn't gonna stop you before!"
"Joey";"I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... (painfully) I'm sorry...!"
"Rachel";"(regretful) I'm sorry, too! (they look at each other sadly, then she recollects, and puts her hands over her eyes) OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!"
"Joey";"NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!"
"Rachel";"It's not a big deal!"
"Joey";"NO BIG DEAL!"
"Rachel";"It's"
"Joey";"Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!"
"Rachel";"Ok!"
"Rachel";"Ok, I..."
"Rachel";"AAAHHHH!"
"Monica";"Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!"
"Monica";"Ah,"
"Mike";"Do"
"Monica";"Ah,"
"Mike";"DO YOU?"
"Monica";"AH YEAAAAH!"
"Chandler";"(to Phoebe) Do you really find this attractive on him?"
"Phoebe";"(looking at Mike) Oh, yeah! (turning to Chandler) Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?"
"Chandler";"I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one."
"Phoebe";"C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!"
"Monica";"Oh, damn it!"
"Phoebe";"(pointing at Mike and shouting) I sleep with him!"
"Mike";"(boasting) Game, point!"
"Monica";"(threatening) Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?"
"Mike";"You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that."
"Monica";"NO, NO, NOOO!"
"Mike";"And that's how it's done! (Phoebe kisses him)"
"Chandler";"Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner."
"Monica";"Best out of three?"
"Mike";"That's what I'm thinking."
"Chandler";"Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?"
"Monica";"(to Mike) Serve the ball, chump!"
"Mike";"(doing Monica and mumbling): Serve the ball, chump."
"Phoebe";"(to Mike) Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back."
"Mr. Oberblau";"I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be (pause) just nifty!"
"Ross";"Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. (Mr. Oberblau giggles)"
"Woman";"Jarvis?"
"Mr. Oberblau";"(seeing her) Oh, you're back... (to Ross) this is my wife, Nancy."
"Ross";"Get Out!"
"Charlie";"Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?"
"Ross";"Yes, please! (they move and sit down on a sofa) So, what's going on?"
"Charlie";"Uh, well... Joey and I broke up."
"Ross";"Oh my God, wh-what happened?"
"Charlie";"Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!"
"Ross";"I knew that was him!"
"Charlie";"Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best."
"Ross";"(holding her hand) Hey, you ok?"
"Charlie";"I guess. There was hum... (she breathes deeply) there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone (pause) else."
"Paleontologist";"(merrily) Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker."
"Ross";"Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here."
"Charlie";"Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?"
"Professore Clerk";"Or we could throw you both in"
"Ross";"(standing) Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with Charlie). GO, GO, GO! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)"
"Mike";"Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41."
"Chandler";"(exhausted) Ok, look! Enough is enough!"
"Monica";"No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!"
"Chandler";"Monica, that was also true an"
"Monica";"I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!"
"Chandler";"But..."
"Monica";"Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!"
"Chandler";"What about the obsessive cleaning?"
"Monica";"That's just good sense!"
"Monica";"(in pain) Aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream)"
"Chandler";"You ok?"
"Monica";"No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! (she shakes the wrist and it's more painful) Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! (pause) Oh my God! I can't play!"
"Mike";"So you forfeit?"
"Phoebe";"Mike wins?"
"Monica";"I can't believe it! (pause) I lost!"
"Chandler";"No, you didn't."
"Monica";"What?"
"Chandler";"Because I'm gonna play for ya."
"Phoebe";"You can't do that!"
"Mike";"Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat."
"Phoebe";"Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister."
"Monica";"(to Chandler) Honey, you don't have to do this."
"Chandler";"(In a loving voice) Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you."
"Monica";"But... you"
"Chandler";"(Still in a loving voice) You're welcome, sweetheart."
"Chandler";"All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins."
"Mike";"Ok!"
"Monica";"Oh my God! You're good!"
"Phoebe";"It's like watching porn!"
"Chandler";"And that's... how... it's done!"
"Monica";"(to Chandler) Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you (pause) Hold on! I almost forgot (she turns to Mike)"
"Chandler";"I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!"
"Monica";"Why?"
"Chandler";"I don't know."
"Monica";"This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!"
"Charlie";"Thanks!"
"Ross";"Hi."
"Charlie";"Are they still looking for us?"
"Ross";"Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. (pause) You know, we as a group are not the coolest."
"Ross";"I don't think they saw us."
"Charlie";"I don't think they did."
"Charlie";"Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum... (pause) There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else."
"Ross";"(apparently unruffled) Oh. Can I... can I ask who?"
"Charlie";"I think you know."
"Ross";"I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so..."
"Ross";"I'm sorry... we... we can't."
"Charlie";"All right, all right."
"Ross";"I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. (pause) Or-or not! (they kiss passionately)"
"Rachel";"What?"
